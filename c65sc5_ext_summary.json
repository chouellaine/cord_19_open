Here, we report that mice immunized with RBD219N1/Alhydrogel\u00ae were fully protected from lethal SARS-CoV challenge (0% mortality), compared to ~ 30% mortality in mice when immunized with the SARS S protein formulated with Alhydrogel\u00ae, and 100% mortality in negative controls.", "title_summ": "Identification of SARS-CoV RBD-targeting monoclonal antibodies with cross-reactive or neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2.Potential for developing a SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) recombinant protein as a heterologous human vaccine against coronavirus infectious disease (COVID)-19.SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV differ in their cell tropism and drug sensitivity profilesA potent neutralizing human antibody reveals the N-terminal domain of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 as a site of vulnerabilityImmunization with the receptor\u2013binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 elicits antibodies cross-neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV without antibody-dependent enhancementThe SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain elicits a potent neutralizing response without antibody-dependent enhancementYeast-Expressed SARS-CoV Recombinant Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD219-N1) Formulated with Alum Induces Protective Immunity and Reduces Immune EnhancementSARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Spike-RBD Structure and Receptor Binding Comparison and Potential Implications on Neutralizing Antibody and Vaccine DevelopmentA neutralizing human antibody binds to the N-terminal domain of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2", "title_abstract_phrases": "Here, we identified six SARS-CoV RBD-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 RBD, two of which, 18F3 and 7B11, neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection.Potential for developing a SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) recombinant protein as a heterologous human vaccine against coronavirus infectious disease (COVID)-19.A SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) recombinant protein was developed and manufactured under current good manufacturing practices in 2016.These findings provide a solid foundation for developing RBD-based subunit vaccines for SARS-CoV2.The SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain elicits a potent neutralizing response without antibody-dependent enhancementThe SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein mediates entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells expressing the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).The S protein engages ACE2 through its receptor-binding domain (RBD), an independently folded 197-amino acid fragment of the 1273-amino acid S-protein protomer.An RBD219-N1 formulation Alhydrogel\u00ae was also superior to the S protein, unadjuvanted RBD, and AddaVax (MF59-like adjuvant)-formulated RBD in inducing specific antibodies and preventing cellular infiltrates in the lungs upon SARS-CoV challenge."}
