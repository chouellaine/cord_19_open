OBJECTIVES To describe cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 disease in hospitalized patients. METHODS We examined the cutaneous manifestations of 210 hospitalized patients. RESULTS Cutaneous findings were observed during COVID-19 infection in 52 of the patients. Lesions may be classified as erythematous scaly rash (32.7%), maculopapular rash (23%), urticarial lesions (13.5%), petechial purpuric rash (7.7%), necrosis (7.7%), enanthema and apthous stomatitis (5.8%), vesicular rash (5.8%), pernio (1.9%) and pruritus (1.9%). Cutaneous manifestations were observed statistically significantly more in certain age groups: patients of 55 to 64 and 65 to 74 years of age complained of more cutaneous manifestations than the other age groups. As for gender, there was no significant difference between male and female patients in terms of cutaneus findings. The relationship between comorbidity and dermatological finding status was statistically significant. The relationship increases linearly according to the comorbidities. According the statistical results the patients who were hospitalized in the intensive care unit had a higher risk of having cutaneous findings due to COVID-19 infection.

RESULTS: Histopathology showed variable degrees of lymphocytic vasculitis ranging from endothelial swelling and endothelialitis to fibrinoid necrosis and thrombosis. Purpura, superficial and deep perivascular lymphocytic inflammation with perieccrine accentuation, oedema, and mild vacuolar interface damage were also seen. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 immunohistochemistry was positive in endothelial cells and epithelial cells of eccrine glands. Coronavirus particles were found in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells on electron microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Although the clinical and histopathological features were similar to other forms of chilblains, the presence of viral particles in the endothelium and the histological evidence of vascular damage, support a causal relation of the lesions with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.

Several patterns have been described since the initial report by Recalcati,(1) including erythematous maculo\u2010papular,(1) urticarial,(1,2) chickenpox\u2010like,(1,3) purpuric peri\u2010flexural,(4) transient livedo reticularis,(5) and acro\u2010ischemic or chilblain\u2010like lesions.(6,7) Herein we report the observation a new pattern with erythema multiforme\u2010like lesions in 4 hospitalized patients with COVID\u201019 infection. All of them were women, and the mean age was 66.75 years (range 58 \u2013 77). The mean time period between the onset of COVID\u201019 symptoms to the appearance of cutaneous lesions was 19.5 days (range 16 \u2013 24). One patient developed the skin rash during hospitalization. The remaining 3 patients had been previously discharged after clinical, analytical and radiologic improvement, and negativization of COVID\u201019 PCR test. These 3 patients returned to the Emergency department consulting for skin rashes 6, 7 and 4 days after discharge, respectively. Laboratory tests at the time of skin lesions showed worsening of one or more parameters, compared to those at the time of discharge (CRP, D\u2010dimer and lymphocyte count). However, none of the patients presented recurrence of clinical symptoms of COVID\u201019. Microbiological studies were performed in 2 patients, excluding other infectious diseases (Table 1). In all patients, skin lesions begun as erythematous papules in upper trunk, that progressively turned to erythemato\u2010violaceous patches with a dusky center, and a pseudo\u2010vesicle in the middle. Typical target lesions were observed in two patients. Lesions were markedly coalescing in the back, and then spread to the face and limbs within 1 week, without involvement of palms and soles (Figure 1). Three patient had their oral cavity examined, showing palatal macules and petechiae. Histological examination was similar in all patients, revealing a normal basket\u2010weave stratum corneum, and mild to moderate spongiosis in epidermis. The dermis showed dilated vessels filled with neutrophils, extravasation of red blood cells, and lymphocytic perivascular and interstitial infiltrate. Basal vacuolar changes with interface dermatitis was observed in 1 patient, and lymphocytic exocytosis in another (Figure 2). All patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids with progressive resolution of the skin lesions within 2\u20103 weeks. We are facing challenging times in Dermatology. New information and cutaneous manifestations possibly related to COVID\u201019 are emerging every day. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether these lesions are associated with the virus, the drug intake or any other conditions. Erythema multiforme (EM) is linked to infectious agents in 90% of the cases, while drug\u2010associated EM is reported in less than 10% of cases. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are the main agents, but other viruses have been reported, such as Adenovirus, Coxsackie, Parvovirus B19.(8) We suggest that this EM\u2010like or target\u2010like exanthem might be another pattern of exanthem associated with COVID\u201019 infection. Recent articles also report targetoid lesions in exanthems of patients with COVID\u201019 infection.(9,10) In addition, the presence of pseudo\u2010vesicles and enanthem are two clues that suggest an infectious cause rather than a drug reaction. However, we cannot positively exclude the involvement of the various drugs administered to the patients. This is a first observation that will require further investigations.","publish_time":1588982400000,"author_summary":" Jimenez\u2010Cauhe, J.; Ortega\u2010Quijano, D.;<br>Carretero\u2010Barrio, I.; Suarez\u2010Valle, A.; Saceda\u2010Corralo, D.;<br>Moreno\u2010Garcia del Real, C.; Fernandez\u2010Nieto, D.","abstract_summary":" Cutaneous manifestations in patients with<br>COVID\u201019 infection are being increasingly reported.<br>Several patterns have been described since the initial<br>report by Recalcati,(1) including erythematous<br>maculo\u2010papular,(1) urticarial,(1,2) chickenpox\u2010like,(1,3)<br>purpuric peri\u2010flexural,(4) transient livedo<br>reticularis,(5) and acro\u2010ischemic or chilblain\u2010like<br>lesions.(6,7) Herein we report the observation a new pattern<br>with erythema multiforme\u2010like lesions in 4<br>hospitalized patients with COVID\u201019 infection.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the cutaneous manifestations of COVID\u201019 disease and to relate them to other clinical findings METHODS: Nationwide case collection survey of images and clinical data. Using a consensus, we described 5 clinical patterns. We later described the association of these patterns with patient demographics, timing in relation to symptoms of the disease, severity, and prognosis. RESULTS: Lesions may be classified as acral areas of erythema with vesicles or pustules (Pseudo\u2010chilblain) (19%), other vesicular eruptions (9%), urticarial lesions (19%), maculopapular eruptions (47%) and livedo or necrosis (6%). Vesicular eruptions appear early in the course of the disease (15% before other symptoms). The pseudo\u2010chilblain pattern frequently appears late in the evolution of the COVID\u201019 disease (59% after other symptoms), while the rest tend to appear with other symptoms of COVID\u201019. Severity of COVID\u201019 shows a gradient from less severe disease in acral lesions to most severe in the latter groups. Results are similar for confirmed and suspected cases, both in terms of clinical and epidemiological findings. Alternative diagnoses are discussed but seem unlikely for the most specific patterns (pseudo\u2010chilblain and vesicular). CONCLUSIONS: We provide a description of the cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID\u201019 infection. These may help clinicians approach patients with the disease and recognize paucisymptomatic cases.","publish_time":1588118400000,"author_summary":" Galv\u00e1n Casas, C.; Catal\u00e0, A.; Carretero<br>Hern\u00e1ndez, G.; Rodr\u00edguez\u2010Jim\u00e9nez, P.; Fern\u00e1ndez Nieto,<br>D.; Rodr\u00edguez\u2010Villa Lario, A.; Navarro<br>Fern\u00e1ndez, I.; Ruiz\u2010Villaverde, R.; Falkenhain, D.;<br>Llamas Velasco, M.; Garc\u00eda\u2010Gav\u00edn, J.; Baniandr\u00e9s,<br>O.; Gonz\u00e1lez\u2010Cruz, C.; Morillas\u2010Lahuerta, V.;<br>Cubir\u00f3, X.; Figueras Nart, I.; Selda\u2010Enriquez, G.;<br>Roman\u00ed, J.; Fust\u00e0\u2010Novell, X.; Melian\u2010Olivera, A.;<br>Roncero Riesco, M.; Burgos\u2010Blasco, P.; Sola Ortigosa,<br>J.; Feito Rodriguez, M.; Garc\u00eda\u2010Doval, I.","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: Cutaneous manifestations of<br>COVID\u201019 disease are poorly characterized.<br>OBJECTIVES: To describe the cutaneous manifestations of<br>COVID\u201019 disease and to relate them to other clinical<br>findings METHODS: Nationwide case collection survey of<br>images and clinical data.

Numerous reports are documenting the occurrence of different cutaneous manifestations in COVID\u201019 patients. OBJECTIVES: To provide a brief overview of the COVID\u201019\u2010associated cutaneous lesions. METHODS: Literature search was performed in the PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases up to 30 April 2020. This narrative review summarizes the available data regarding clinical and histological features of COVID\u201019\u2010associated skin manifestations. RESULTS: Literature reports showed a great heterogeneity in COVID\u201019\u2010associated cutaneous manifestations, as well as in their latency periods and associated extracutaneous symptoms. Pathogenic mechanisms are unknown, although the role of hyperactive immune response, complement activation and microvascular injury has been hypothesized. Based on our experience and the literature data, we subdivided the reported cutaneous lesions into six main clinical patterns: i) urticarial rash, ii) confluent erythematous\/maculo\u2010papular\/morbilliform rash, iii) papulovesicular exanthem, iv) chilblain\u2010like acral pattern, v) livedo reticularis\/racemosa\u2010like pattern, vi) purpuric \u201cvasculitic\u201d pattern.

A prospective study and literature review","doi":"10.1111\/jdv.16665","abstract":"Recently, young COVID\u201019 patients have presented with erythematous and purpuric acral lesions similar to chilblains(1\u20133). Despite the scarcity of published cases, this topic has attracted significant mass media attention.(4) Dermatologists have noted that more people than would be expected at this time of year are seeking medical attention for these chilblain\u2010like lesions. Some have suggested that people presenting with this manifestation should be tested and isolated(2). Determining the accuracy of this association is therefore crucial. To establish the real prevalence of COVID\u201019 in patients with acral skin lesions, we firstly evaluated all the cases of acral lesions presented in dermatology and paediatrics departments and family doctors\u2019 offices in an eastern Spanish region over a three\u2010week period. Then we prospectively performed a SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirates taken from all available patients to determine whether their cutaneous manifestations were predictive of a positive result. To put our findings into context, we reviewed all the articles published before May 2020 concerning COVID\u201019 patients with cutaneous lesions. We evaluated 58 patients, whose characteristics are summarized in Table 1. In most cases, lesions were chilblain\u2010like. Fifteen patients had already been tested, and only one had a positive result: an 85\u2010year\u2010old man admitted for severe Covid\u201019 pneumonia. He had an ulcer on a toe that was finally determined to be vascular in nature. We performed prospective PCR testing in 24 patients. All test results were negative. In total, then, PCR was negative in 38 patients and positive in a single patient whose lesion was very unlikely to be due to COVID\u201019. Our bibliography search returned 97 articles and we found 2 more through cross\u2010references. Nine of these articles dealt with acral lesions specifically. Their results are summarized in Table 2. Data published in the literature are heterogeneous, as are the methods employed to collect them. The first papers looked at cutaneous manifestations in patients with confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection.(5\u20138) This approach cannot reveal whether this dermatologic manifestation is a specific marker of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, since patients without COVID\u201019 are not included. The other approach, which we have followed, is to analyse all patients with acral lesions. This can be done retrospectively, reporting on patients in the sample who have already been tested, or prospectively, performing the test on all available patients, regardless of whether they have symptoms. The retrospective method has a significant risk of confounding bias: due to the scarcity of COVID\u201019 tests(8), they are usually reserved for patients with COVID\u201019\u2010related symptoms, who are obviously more likely to test positive. All previous studies including only patients with cutaneous acral lesions (summarized in table 2) have been retrospective, and only a minority of patients were tested. In total, 12 out of at least 49 tested patients were positive (24.5%). Combined with our results, they total 13 positives out of 88 tests (14.8%). There are two possible explanations for the high proportion of negative results: I) A high number of false negatives. II) The lesions are not related to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. The low prevalence of an infected contact in our sample, after three weeks of strict confinement in Spain, makes the possibility of being infected in our cohort less likely. The diffusion of this entity by the mass media may have caused patients who would not normally consult to do so.(9) . Other possible explanations include a concomitant parvovirus B19 outbreak(10) or trauma\u2010induced lesions. Our study suggests that acral skin lesions are not a specific marker of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Although larger prospective studies are needed, current evidence indicates that acral skin lesions should not be regarded as a sign of COVID\u201019 in otherwise asymptomatic patients.","publish_time":1590451200000,"author_summary":" Docampo\u2010Sim\u00f3n, A.; S\u00e1nchez\u2010Pujol, M.J.;<br>Juan\u2010Carpena, G.; Palaz\u00f3n\u2010Cabanes, J.C.; Vergara\u2010De Caso,<br>E.; Berbegal, L.; Poveda\u2010Montoyo, I.;<br>Pastor\u2010Tom\u00e1s, N.; Mataix\u2010D\u00edaz, J.; Terencio\u2010Alemany, C.;<br>Mart\u00ednez\u2010Torres, A.; Miralles\u2010Botella, J.; Blanes\u2010Mart\u00ednez,<br>M.; Gonz\u00e1lez\u2010Villanueva, I.; Betlloch\u2010Mas, I.","abstract_summary":" Recently, young COVID\u201019 patients have<br>presented with erythematous and purpuric acral lesions<br>similar to chilblains(1\u20133).

However, overall similarities in the clinical presentation of these dermatological manifestations have not yet been summarized. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to provide an overview of various cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19 through three case reports and a literature review. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, OVID, and Google search engines for original and review articles. Studies written in the English language that mentioned cutaneous symptoms and COVID-19 were included. RESULTS: Eighteen articles and three additional cases reported in this paper were included in this review. Of these studies, 6 are case series and 12 are case report studies. The most common cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 was found to be maculopapular exanthem (morbilliform), presenting in 36.1% (26\/72) patients. The other cutaneous manifestations included: a papulovesicular rash (34.7%, 25\/72), urticaria (9.7%, 7\/72), painful acral red purple papules (15.3%, 11\/72) of patients, livedo reticularis lesions (2.8%, 2\/72) and petechiae (1.4%, 1\/72). Majority of lesions were localized on the trunk (66.7%, 50\/72), however, 19.4% (14\/72) of patients experienced cutaneous manifestations in the hands and feet. Skin lesion development occurred before the onset of respiratory symptoms or COVID-19 diagnosis in 12.5% (9\/72) of the patients, and lesions spontaneously healed in all patients within 10 days. Majority of the studies reported no correlation between COVID-19 severity and skin lesions.

However, only few patients proved positivity for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. The relationship between this skin manifestation and COVID\u201019 infection has not been clarified yet. OBJECTIVE: To thoroughly characterize a prospective group of patients with chilblain\u2010like lesions, and to investigate the possible relationship with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. METHODS: Following informed consent, patients underwent: (i) clinical evaluation, (ii) RT\u2010PCR and serology testing for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, (iii) digital videocapillaroscopy of finger\u2010 and toe\u2010nailfolds, (iv) blood testing to screen for autoimmune diseases and coagulation anomalies, and (v) skin biopsy for histopathology, direct immunofluorescence, and, in selected cases, electron microscopy. RESULTS: Nineteen patients, all adolescents (mean age: 14 years), were recruited. 11\/19 (58%) of them and\/or their cohabitants reported flu\u2010like symptoms one to two months prior to skin manifestation onset. Lesions were localized to toes and also heels and soles. Videocapillarcosopy showed pericapillary oedema, dilated and abnormal capillaries, and microhemorrhages both in finger and toe in the majority of patients. Major pathological findings included: epidermal basal layer vacuolation, papillary dermis oedema and erythrocyte extravasation, perivascular and perieccrine dermal lymphocytic infiltrate, and mucin deposition in the dermis and hypodermis; dermal vessel thrombi were observed in 2 cases. Blood exams were normal. Nasopharyngeal swab for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and IgG serology for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleocapsid protein were negative. Importantly, IgA serology for S1 domain of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein was positive in 6 patients and borderline in 3. CONCLUSIONS: Chilblain\u2010like lesions during COVID\u201019 pandemic have specific epidemiologic, clinical, capillaroscopic and histopathological characteristics, which distinguish them from idiopathic perniosis. Though we could not formally prove SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection in our patients, history data and the detection of anti\u2010SARS\u2010COV\u20102 IgA strongly suggest a relationship between skin lesions and COVID\u201019.

RESULTS: All patients had lesions clinically consistent with chilblains of the toes or feet, with three also having lesions of the fingers. Pruritus and mild pain were the only skin symptoms elicited, and only 10 had mild respiratory and\/or GI symptoms. None had fever. Coagulation tests, hemogram, serum chemistry, and lupus anticoagulant were normal in all patients tested. One out of 16 tested cases had elevated D\u2010dimer results, but without systemic symptoms or other laboratory anomalies. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 PCR tested in 19 cases was positive in just one case. Skin biopsies obtained in six patients were consistent with chilblains. On follow\u2010up, all cases showed spontaneous marked improvement or complete healing.

They all presented with red to violaceous macules and dusky, purpuric plaques scattered on the mid and distal aspects of the toes.

Patients with pernio-like lesions were generally young and healthy, with relatively mild COVID-19. Of 318 cases confirmed or suspected as COVID-19 by providers, twenty-three cases (7%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive, and 20 others (6%) were close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Given current testing criteria, many patients lacked COVID-19 testing access. For 55% of patients, pernio-like lesions were their only symptom. In patients with other COVID-19 symptoms, pernio-like lesions typically appeared after other symptoms. Pernio-like lesions lasted a median of 14 days (IQR 10-21).
