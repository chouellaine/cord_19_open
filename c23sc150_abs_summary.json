{"cluster": 23, "subcluster": 150, "abstract_summ": " We show that the COVID-19 pandemic under social distancing exhibits universal dynamics . The cumulative numbers of both infections and deaths quickly cross over from exponential growth at early times to a longer period of power law growth, before eventually slowing . We present simulations showing this universal dynamics is consistent with disease transmission on scale-free networks and random networks with non-Markovian transmission dynamics ."}
