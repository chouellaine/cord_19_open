{"cluster": 56, "subcluster": 9, "abstract_summ": " SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the present coronavirus pandemic and some suggestions were made about its possible artificial origin . We compared SARS with known viruses that were prepared in the laboratory and other relevant natural strains to estimate their genetic relatedness . Our data support the natural origin of the COVID-19 virus, likely derived from bats, possibly transferred to pangolins ."}
