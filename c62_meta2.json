Molecular docking was used to predict binding models between curcumin derivatives and neuraminidase. Real-time polymerase chain reactions showed that the five active curcumin derivatives might have direct effects on viral particle infectivity in H1N1-infected lung epithelial (MDCK) cells. Neuraminidase activation assay showed that five active curcumin derivatives decreased H1N1-induced neuraminidase activation in MDCK cells. Indirect immunofluorescence assay indicated that two active curcumin derivatives (tetramethylcurcumin and curcumin) down-regulated the nucleoprotein expression. Curcumin inhibited IAV in vivo. The therapeutic mechanism of curcumin in the treatment of influenza viral pneumonia is related to improving the immune function of infected mice and regulating secretion of tumor necrosis-\u03b1, interleukin-6, and interferon-\u03b3. These results indicate that curcumin derivatives inhibit IAV by blocking neuraminidase in the cellular model and curcumin also has anti-IAV activity in the animal model.","publish_time":1585958400000,"author_summary":" Lai, Yanni; Yan, Yiwen; Liao, Shanghui; Li,<br>Yun; Ye, Yi; Liu, Ni; Zhao, Fang; Xu, Peiping","abstract_summary":" Curcumin derivatives have been shown to<br>inhibit replication of human influenza A viruses<br>(IAVs).

Combined 50 ns MD simulations and MM-GBSA calculations revealed nine potent NLPs with binding affinities (\u0394Gbinding ) > -48.0 kcal\/mol. Interestingly, among the identified NLPs, four bis([1,3]dioxolo)pyran-5-carboxamide derivatives showed \u0394Gbinding > -56.0 kcal\/mol, forming essential short hydrogen bonds with HIS163 and GLY143 amino acids via dioxolane oxygen atoms. Structural and energetic analyses over 50 ns MD simulation demonstrated NLP-Mpro complex stability. Drug-likeness predictions revealed the prospects of the identified NLPs as potential drug candidates. The findings are expected to provide a novel contribution to the field of COVID-19 drug discovery. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

To identify therapeutics that might be repositioned for treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 disease COVID-19, we strategically reviewed the literature to identify existing therapeutics with evidence of efficacy for the treatment of the three coronaviruses that cause severe respiratory illness (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2). Mechanistic and in vitro analyses suggest multiple promising therapeutic options with potential for repurposing to treat patients with COVID-19. Therapeutics with particularly high potential efficacy for repurposing include camostat mesylate, remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, convalescent plasma, and humanized monoclonal antibodies. Camostat mesylate has shown therapeutic potential, likely by preventing viral entry into epithelial cells. In early research, the targeted antivirals remdesivir and favipiravir appear to benefit patients by decreasing viral replication; clinical trials suggest that remdesivir speeds recovery from COVID-19. Tocilizumab and baricitinib appear to improve mortality by preventing a severe cytokine storm.

There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven clinical efficacy, nor are there vaccines for its prevention, and these efforts are hampered by limited knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To address this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), identifying 332 high-confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 compounds (29 FDA-approved drugs, 12 drugs in clinical trials, and 28 preclinical compounds). Screening a subset of these in multiple viral assays identified two sets of pharmacological agents that displayed antiviral activity: inhibitors of mRNA translation and predicted regulators of the Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptors. Further studies of these host factor targeting agents, including their combination with drugs that directly target viral enzymes, could lead to a therapeutic regimen to treat COVID-19.","publish_time":1588204800000,"author_summary":" Gordon, David E; Jang, Gwendolyn M; Bouhaddou,<br>Mehdi; Xu, Jiewei; Obernier, Kirsten; White, Kris M;<br>O'Meara, Matthew J; Rezelj, Veronica V; Guo, Jeffrey Z;<br>Swaney, Danielle L; Tummino, Tia A; Huettenhain, Ruth;<br>Kaake, Robyn M; Richards, Alicia L; Tutuncuoglu,<br>Beril; Foussard, Helene; Batra, Jyoti; Haas, Kelsey;<br>Modak, Maya; Kim, Minkyu; Haas, Paige; Polacco,<br>Benjamin J; Braberg, Hannes; Fabius, Jacqueline M;<br>Eckhardt, Manon; Soucheray, Margaret; Bennett, Melanie<br>J; Cakir, Merve; McGregor, Michael J; Li,<br>Qiongyu; Meyer, Bjoern; Roesch, Ferdinand; Vallet,<br>Thomas; Mac Kain, Alice; Miorin, Lisa; Moreno, Elena;<br>Naing, Zun Zar Chi; Zhou, Yuan; Peng, Shiming; Shi,<br>Ying; Zhang, Ziyang; Shen, Wenqi; Kirby, Ilsa T;<br>Melnyk, James E; Chorba, John S; Lou, Kevin; Dai,<br>Shizhong A; Barrio-Hernandez, Inigo; Memon, Danish;<br>Hernandez-Armenta, Claudia; Lyu, Jiankun; Mathy, Christopher J P;<br>Perica, Tina; Pilla, Kala B; Ganesan, Sai J; Saltzberg,<br>Daniel J; Rakesh, Ramachandran; Liu, Xi; Rosenthal,<br>Sara B; Calviello, Lorenzo; Venkataramanan,<br>Srivats; Liboy-Lugo, Jose; Lin, Yizhu; Huang, Xi-Ping;<br>Liu, YongFeng; Wankowicz, Stephanie A; Bohn,<br>Markus; Safari, Maliheh; Ugur, Fatima S; Koh,<br>Cassandra; Savar, Nastaran Sadat; Tran, Quang Dinh;<br>Shengjuler, Djoshkun; Fletcher, Sabrina J; O'Neal,<br>Michael C; Cai, Yiming; Chang, Jason C J; Broadhurst,<br>David J; Klippsten, Saker; Sharp, Phillip P;<br>Wenzell, Nicole A; Kuzuoglu, Duygu; Wang, Hao-Yuan;<br>Trenker, Raphael; Young, Janet M; Cavero, Devin A;<br>Hiatt, Joseph; Roth, Theodore L; Rathore, Ujjwal;<br>Subramanian, Advait; Noack, Julia; Hubert, Mathieu;<br>Stroud, Robert M; Frankel, Alan D; Rosenberg, Oren S;<br>Verba, Kliment A; Agard, David A; Ott, Melanie;<br>Emerman, Michael; Jura, Natalia; von Zastrow, Mark;<br>Verdin, Eric; Ashworth, Alan; Schwartz, Olivier;<br>d'Enfert, Christophe; Mukherjee, Shaeri; Jacobson,<br>Matt; Malik, Harmit S; Fujimori, Danica G; Ideker,<br>Trey; Craik, Charles S; Floor, Stephen N; Fraser,<br>James S; Gross, John D; Sali, Andrej; Roth, Bryan L;<br>Ruggero, Davide; Taunton, Jack; Kortemme, Tanja;<br>Beltrao, Pedro; Vignuzzi, Marco; Garc\u00eda-Sastre,<br>Adolfo; Shokat, Kevan M; Shoichet, Brian K; Krogan,<br>Nevan J","abstract_summary":" The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the<br>causative agent of COVID-19 respiratory disease, has<br>infected over 2.3 million people, killed over 160,000,<br>and caused worldwide social and economic<br>disruption1,2.

Famotidine, a class A G protein-coupled receptor antagonist used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux was recently identified in an in silico screening. Additionally, a recent retrospective clinical report showed that the treatment with famotidine provided a good outcome in patients infected with SARS-CoV2. A clinical trial testing effectiveness of famotidine in combination with hydroxychloroquine is currently ongoing in the United States (US). In the 1990s, famotidine was described as an antiviral agent against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Interestingly, some HIV protease inhibitors are presently being used against SARS-CoV2. However, it is not clear if famotidine could be effective against SARS-CoV2. Thus, by using a computational analysis, we aimed to examine if the antiviral effect of famotidine could be related to the inhibition of proteases involved in the virus replication. Our results showed that famotidine could interact within the catalytic site of the three proteases associated with SARS-CoV2 replication. However, weak binding affinity of famotidine to these proteases suggests that a successful famotidine therapy could likely be achieved only in combination with other antiviral drugs. Finally, analysis of famotidine's pharmacokinetic parameters indicated that its effect against SARS-CoV2 infection could be reached only upon intravenous administration. This work will contribute to the pharmacological knowledge of famotidine as an antiviral agent against SARS-CoV2.","publish_time":1592956800000,"author_summary":" Ortega, Joseph T; Serrano, Maria Luisa;<br>Jastrzebska, Beata","abstract_summary":" The pandemic associated with Severe Acute<br>Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV2) and<br>its disease named COVID-19 challenged the<br>scientific community to discover effective therapeutic<br>solutions in a short period.

This study involves the In silico interactions of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine with the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2. With the help of various computational methods, we have re-explored the potential role of both of these antiviral drugs for the treatment of Covid-19 patients by comparing the efficacy of both of the drugs to bind to S-protein at its host receptor region. In our research Hydroxychloroquine exhibited potential inhibitory effectsof S-protein with binding energy -7.28 kcal\/mol than Chloroquine (-6.30 kcal\/mol) at SARS-CoV-2 receptor recognition of susceptible cells. The outcomes of this research strongly appeal for in vivo trials of Hydroxychloroquine for the patients infected with Covid-19. Furthermore, the recommended doses of Hydroxychloroquine may reduce the chances of catching Covid-19 to the healthcare workers and staff who are in contact with or delivering direct care to coronavirus patients as long as they have not been diagnosed with Covid-19. We further hypothesize that the comparative S-protein-drug docking interactions may help to understand the comparative efficacy of other candidate repurposing drugs until discovery of a proper vaccine.","publish_time":1590710400000,"author_summary":" Amin, Muhammad; Abbas, Ghazanfer","abstract_summary":" Recent outbreak of novel Coronavirus disease<br>(Covid-19) pandemic around the world is associated with<br>severe acute respiratory syndrome.

Thus, it is extremely necessary to identify new drugs suitable for the treatment of the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Different preclinical studies conducted on other coronaviruses suggested that promising clinical outcomes for 2019-nCoV should be obtained by using alpha-interferon, chloroquine phosphate, arabinol, remdesivir, lopinavir\/ritonavir, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Moreover, clinical trials with these suitable drugs should be performed on patients affected by SARS-Cov-2 to prove their efficacy and safety. Finally, a very promising therapeutic drug, tocilizumab, is discussed; it is currently used to treat patients presenting COVID-19 pneumonia. Herein, we recapitulate these experimental studies to highlight the use of antiviral drugs for the treatment of SARS-Cov-2 disease.","publish_time":1590969600000,"author_summary":" Bimonte, Sabrina; Crispo, Anna; Amore,<br>Alfonso; Celentano, Egidio; Cuomo, Arturo; Cascella,<br>Marco","abstract_summary":" Severe acute respiratory syndrome<br>coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), initially termed 2019-new CoV<br>(2019-nCoV), is a novel coronavirus responsible for the<br>severe respiratory illness currently ongoing<br>worldwide from the beginning of December 2019.

METHODS 31 repurposed compounds have been selected targeting coronavirus protease (6LU7) and a machine learning approach was employed to generate shape-based molecules starting from 3D shape to pharmacophoric features of its seed compound. Ligand-Receptor docking was performed with Optimized Potential for Liquid Simulations (OPLS3) algorithms to identify high-affinity compounds from the list of selected candidates for 6LU7. This compound was subjected to Molecular Dynamic Simulations followed by ADMET studies and other analysis. RESULTS Shape-based Machine learning reported Remdesivir, Valrubicin, Aprepitant, and Fulvestrant and a novel therapeutic compound as the best therapeutic agents with the highest affinity for its target protein.

Out of 11 curated screened compounds, we found the significant docking score for tinosponone, xanosporic acid, cardiofolioside B, tembetarine and berberine in Tinospora cordifolia. Based on the findings of the docking study, it was confirmed that tinosponone is the potent inhibitor of main protease of SARS-CoV-2 with the best binding affinity of -7.7 kcal\/mol. Further, ADME along with toxicity analysis was studied to predict the pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness properties of five top hits compounds. The molecular dynamics simulation analysis confirmed the stability of tinosponone and 3CL pro complex with a random mean square deviation (RMSD) value of 0.1 nm.

A crucial prerequisite for completing the medication regimen for oral drugs, particularly for pediatric and geriatric populations, is achieving taste that does not hinder compliance. Currently, the aversive taste of drugs is tested in late stages of clinical trials. This can result in the need to reformulate, potentially resulting in the use of more animals for additional toxicity trials, increased financial costs and a delay in release to the market. Here we present BitterIntense, a machine learning tool that classifies molecules into \u201cvery bitter\u201d or \u201cnot very bitter\u201d, based on their chemical structure. The model, trained on chemically diverse compounds, has above 80% accuracy on several test sets. BitterIntense suggests that intense bitterness does not correlate with toxicity and hepatotoxicity of drugs and that the prevalence of very bitter compounds among drugs is lower than among microbial compounds. BitterIntense allows quick and easy prediction of strong bitterness of compounds of interest for food and pharma industries. We estimate that implementation of BitterIntense or similar tools early in drug discovery and development process may lead to reduction in delays, in animal use and in overall financial burden. Significance Statement Drug development integrates increasingly sophisticated technologies, but extreme bitterness of drugs remains a poorly addressed cause of medicine regimen incompletion. Reformulating the drug can result in delays in the development of a potential medicine, increasing the lead time to the patients. It might also require the use of extra animals in toxicity trials and lead to increased costs for pharma companies. We have developed a computational predictor for intense bitterness, that has above 80% accuracy. Applying the classifier to annotated datasets suggests that intense bitterness does not correlate with toxicity and hepatotoxicity of drugs. BitterIntense can be used in the early stages of drug development to identify drug candidates that require bitterness masking, and thus reduce animal use, time and monetary loss.","publish_time":1593043200000,"author_summary":" Margulis, Eitan; Dagan-Wiener, Ayana; Ives,<br>Robert S.; Jaffari, Sara; Siems, Karsten; Niv, Masha<br>Y.","abstract_summary":" Drug development is a long, expensive and<br>multistage process geared to achieving safe drugs with<br>high efficacy.

These predictive features throughout the enzyme would not have been identified without dynamics and machine learning and specifically varied with potency. This approach enables capturing the conserved dynamic molecular mechanisms by which complex combinations of mutations confer resistance and identifying critical interactions which serve as bellwethers over a wide range of inhibitor potency.

Numerous promising therapeutic and vaccine research efforts to mitigate the catastrophic effects of COVID-19 pandemic are underway, yet an efficacious countermeasure is still not available. To support these global research efforts, we have used a novel computational pipeline combining machine learning, bioinformatics, and supercomputing to predict antibody structures capable of targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). In 22 days, using just the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and previously published neutralizing antibody structures for SARS-CoV-1, we generated 20 initial antibody sequences predicted to target the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. As a first step in this process, we predicted (and publicly released) structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using homology-based structural modeling. The predicted structures proved to be accurate within the targeted RBD region when compared to experimentally derived structures published weeks later. Next we used our in silico design platform to iteratively propose mutations to SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies (known not to bind SARS-Cov-2) to enable and optimize binding within the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Starting from a calculated baseline free energy of \u221248.1 kcal\/mol (\u00b1 8.3), our 20 selected first round antibody structures are predicted to have improved interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with free energies as low as \u221282.0 kcal\/mole. The baseline SARS-CoV-1 antibody in complex with the SARS-CoV-1 RBD has a calculated interaction energy of \u221252.2 kcal\/mole and neutralizes the virus by preventing it from binding and entering the human ACE2 receptor. These results suggest that our predicted antibody mutants may bind the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and potentially neutralize the virus. Additionally, our selected antibody mutants score well according to multiple antibody developability metrics. These antibody designs are being expressed and experimentally tested for binding to COVID-19 viral proteins, which will provide invaluable feedback to further improve the machine learning\u2013driven designs.

So, there is an urgent requirement of new and effective medications that can treat the disease caused by SARS CoV 2. Methods and findings We perform the study of drugs that are already available in the market and being used for other diseases to accelerate clinical recovery, in other words repurposing of existing drugs. The vast complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often prohibit developing various new drug combinations for this epidemic disease in a limited time. Recently, remarkable improvements in computational power coupled with advancements in Machine Learning (ML) technology have been utilized to revolutionize the drug development process. Consequently, a detailed study using ML for the repurposing of therapeutic agents is urgently required. Here, we report the ML model based on the Naive Bayes algorithm, which has an accuracy of around 73% to predict the drugs that could be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Our study predicts around ten FDA approved commercial drugs that can be used for repurposing. Among all, we suggest that the antiretroviral drug Atazanavir (DrugBank ID DB01072) would probably be one of the most effective drugs based on the selected criterions.

Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%) among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs. Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known HCoV-host interactions in the human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putative repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs. In addition, we prioritized 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (including melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. Finally, we showcased three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the Complementary Exposure pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human protein-protein interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations toward future clinical trials for HCoVs.","publish_time":1580860800000,"author_summary":" Zhou, Yadi; Hou, Yuan; Shen, Jiayu; Huang, Yin;<br>Martin, William; Cheng, Feixiong","abstract_summary":" Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs), including<br>severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus<br>(SARS-CoV), Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus<br>(MERS-CoV), and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), lead<br>global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality.<br>However, there are currently no effective drugs<br>targeting 2019-nCoV.

The expression level of pharmaco-genes in single cell resolution was evaluated from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of 17 healthy adults.

There is no therapeutic treatment specific for COVID-19. It is highly desirable to identify potential antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 from existing drugs available for other diseases and, thus, repurpose them for treatment of COVID-19. In general, a drug repurposing effort for treatment of a new disease, such as COVID-19, usually starts from a virtual screening of existing drugs, followed by experimental validation, but the actual hit rate is generally rather low with traditional computational methods. Here we report a new virtual screening approach with accelerated free energy perturbation-based absolute binding free energy (FEP-ABFE) predictions and its use in identifying drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). The accurate FEP-ABFE predictions were based on the use of a new restraint energy distribution (RED) function designed to accelerate the FEP-ABFE calculations and make the practical FEP-ABFE-based virtual screening of the existing drug library possible for the first time. As a result, out of twenty-five drugs predicted, fifteen were confirmed as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The most potent one is dipyridamole (Ki=0.04 \u03bcM) which has showed promising therapeutic effects in subsequently conducted clinical studies for treatment of patients with COVID-19. Additionally, hydroxychloroquine (Ki=0.36 \u03bcM) and chloroquine (Ki=0.56 \u03bcM) were also found to potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro for the first time. We anticipate that the FEP-ABFE prediction-based virtual screening approach will be useful in many other drug repurposing or discovery efforts.

Its main protease (Mpro) represents an attractive pharmacological target due to its involvement in essential viral functions. The crystal structure of free Mpro shows a large structural resemblance with the main protease of SARS CoV (nowadays known as SARS CoV-1). Here we report that as average SARS CoV-2 Mpro is 1900% more sensitive than SARS CoV-1 Mpro in transmitting tiny structural changes across the whole protein through long-range interactions. The largest sensitivity of Mpro to structural perturbations is located exactly around the catalytic site Cys-145, and coincides with the binding site of strong inhibitors. These findings, based on a simplified representation of the protein as a residue network, may help in designing potent inhibitors of SARS CoV-2 Mpro. The main protease of the new coronavirus SARS CoV-2 represents one of the most important targets for the antiviral pharmacological actions againsts COVID-19. This enzyme is essential for the virus due to its proteolytic processing of polyproteins. Here we discover that the main protease of SARS CoV-2 is topologically very similar to that of the SARS CoV-1. This is not surprising taking into account that both proteases differ only in 12 amino acids. However, we remarkable found a topological property of SARS CoV-2 that has increased in more than 1900% repect to its SARS CoV-1 analogue. This property reflects the capacity of the new protease of transmitting perturbations across its domains using long-range interactions. Also remarkable is the fact that the amino acids displaying such increased sensitivity to perturbations are around the binding site of the new protease, and close to its catalytic site. We also show that this sensititivy to perturbations is related to the effects of powerful protease inhibitors. In fact, the strongest inhibitors of the SARS CoV-2 main protease are those that produce the least change of this capacity of transmitting perturbations across the protein.

In this work, we test the hypothesis that these drugs act primarily as mechanism-based inhibitors by comparing hydrated excess proton stabilization during proton transport in M2 with the interactions revealed in the crystal structures, using the Multiscale Reactive Molecular Dynamics (MS-RMD) methodology. MS-RMD, unlike classical molecular dynamics, models the hydrated proton (hydronium-like cation) as a dynamic excess charge defect and allows bonds to break and form, capturing the intricate interactions between the hydrated excess proton, protein atoms, and water. Through this, we show that the ammonium group of the inhibitors is effectively positioned to take advantage of the channel\u2019s natural ability to stabilize an excess protonic charge and is thus acting as a hydronium-mimic. Additionally, we show that the channel is especially stable in the drug binding region, highlighting the importance of this property for binding the adamantane group. Finally, we characterize an additional hinge point near Val27, which dynamically responds to charge and inhibitor binding. Altogether, this work further illuminates a dynamic understanding of the mechanism of drug inhibition in M2, grounded in the fundamental properties that enable the channel to transport and stabilize excess protons, with critical implications for future drug design efforts.

We developed a data-driven drug repositioning framework, which applies both machine learning and statistical analysis approaches to systematically integrate and mine large-scale knowledge graph, literature and transcriptome data to discover the potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. The retrospective study using the past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus. Our in silico screening followed by wet-lab validation indicated that a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, CVL218, currently in Phase I clinical trial, may be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Our in vitro assays revealed that CVL218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication without obvious cytopathic effect. In addition, we showed that CVL218 is able to suppress the CpG-induced IL-6 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that it may also have anti-inflammatory effect that is highly relevant to the prevention immunopathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic evaluation in rats and monkeys showed a high concentration of CVL218 in lung and observed no apparent signs of toxicity, indicating the appealing potential of this drug for the treatment of the pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, molecular docking simulation suggested that CVL218 may bind to the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2, providing a possible model to explain its antiviral action. We also proposed several possible mechanisms to explain the antiviral activities of PARP1 inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, based on the data present in this study and previous evidences reported in the literature. In summary, the PARP1 inhibitor CVL218 discovered by our data-driven drug repositioning framework can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of COVID-19.","publish_time":1583971200000,"author_summary":" Ge, Yiyue; Tian, Tingzhong; Huang, Suling;<br>Wan, Fangping; Li, Jingxin; Li, Shuya; Yang, Hui;<br>Hong, Lixiang; Wu, Nian; Yuan, Enming; Cheng, Lili;<br>Lei, Yipin; Shu, Hantao; Feng, Xiaolong; Jiang,<br>Ziyuan; Chi, Ying; Guo, Xiling; Cui, Lunbiao; Xiao,<br>Liang; Li, Zeng; Yang, Chunhao; Miao, Zehong; Tang,<br>Haidong; Chen, Ligong; Zeng, Hainian; Zhao, Dan; Zhu,<br>Fengcai; Shen, Xiaokun; Zeng, Jianyang","abstract_summary":" The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 requires an<br>urgent need to find effective therapeutics for the<br>treatment of COVID-19.

Given its essential role in proteolytic processing, the main protease Mpro has been identified as an attractive candidate for drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and similar coronaviruses. Recent high-throughput screening studies have identified a set of existing, small-molecule drugs as potent Mpro inhibitors. Amongst these, Ebselen (2-Phenyl-1,2-benzoselenazol-3-one), a glutathione peroxidase mimetic seleno-organic compound, is particularly attractive. Recent experiments suggest that its effectiveness is higher than that of other molecules that also act at the enzyme catalytic site. By relying on extensive simulations with all-atom models, in this study we examine at a molecular level the potential of Ebselen to decrease Mpro catalytic activity. Our results indicate that Ebselen exhibits a distinct affinity for the catalytic site cavity of Mpro. In addition, our molecular models reveal a second, previously unkown binding site for Ebselen in the dimerization region localized between the II and III domains of the protein. A detailed analysis of the free energy of binding indicates that the affinity of Ebselen to this second binding site is in fact significantly larger than that to the catalytic site. A strain analysis indicates that Ebselen bound between the II-III domains exerts a pronounced allosteric effect that regulates catalytic site access through surface loop interactions, and induces a displacement and reconfiguration of water hotspots, including the catalytic water, which could interfere with normal enzymatic function. Taken together, these findings provide a framework for the future design of more potent and specific Mpro inhibitors, based on the Ebselen scaffold, that could lead to new therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.","publish_time":1589932800000,"author_summary":" Menendez, Cintia A.; Bylehn, Fabian;<br>Perez-Lemus, Gustavo R.; Alvarado, Walter; Pablo, Juan J. de","abstract_summary":" The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic<br>caused by the SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)<br>urgently calls for the design of drugs directed against<br>this new virus.

Four metabolites, i.e., asiatic acid, avicularin, guajaverin, and withaferin showed maximum binding affinity with all key proteins in terms of lowest global binding energy.

The top candidates were further employed for ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) analysis to investigate their drug profiles. Results suggest that none of the compounds render any undesirable consequences that could reduce their drug likeness properties. The analysis of toxicity pattern revealed no significant tumorigenic, mutagenic, irritating, or reproductive effects by the compounds. However, withaferin was comparatively toxic among the top four candidates with considerable cytotoxicity and immunotoxicity. Most of the target class by top drug candidates belonged to enzyme groups (e.g. oxidoreductases hydrolases, phosphatases).

A rush to find the cures prompted re-evaluation of a range of existing therapeutics vis-\u00e0-vis their potential role in treating COVID-19, placing a premium on analytical tools capable of supporting such efforts. Native mass spectrometry (MS) has long been a tool of choice in supporting the mechanistic studies of drug\/therapeutic target interactions, but its applications remain limited in the cases that involve systems with a high level of structural heterogeneity. Both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-protein), a critical element of the viral entry to the host cell, and ACE2, its docking site on the host cell surface, are extensively glycosylated, making them challenging targets for native MS. However, supplementing native MS with a gas-phase ion manipulation technique (limited charge reduction) allows meaningful information to be obtained on the non-covalent complexes formed by ACE2 and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein. Using this technique in combination with molecular modeling also allows the role of heparin in destabilizing the ACE2\/RBD association to be studied, providing critical information for understanding the molecular mechanism of its interference with the virus docking to the host cell receptor. Both short (pentasaccharide) and relatively long (eicosasaccharide) heparin oligomers form 1:1 complexes with RBD, indicating the presence of a single binding site. This association alters the protein conformation (to maximize the contiguous patch of the positive charge on the RBD surface), resulting in a notable decrease of its ability to associate with ACE2. The destabilizing effect of heparin is more pronounced in the case of the longer chains due to the electrostatic repulsion between the low-pI ACE2 and the heparin segments not accommodated on the RBD surface. In addition to providing important mechanistic information on attenuation of the ACE2\/RBD association by heparin, the study demonstrates the yet untapped potential of native MS coupled to gas-phase ion chemistry as a means of facilitating rational repurposing of the existing medicines for treating COVID-19.","publish_time":1591747200000,"author_summary":" Yang, Yang; Du, Yi; Kaltashov, Igor A.","abstract_summary":" The emergence and rapid proliferation of the<br>novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in a global<br>pandemic, with over six million cases and nearly four<br>hundred thousand deaths reported world-wide by the end<br>of May 2020.

Given the global health emergency, drug repositioning is the most reliable option to design an efficient therapy for infected patients without delay. The first step of the viral replication cycle [i.e. attachment to the surface of respiratory cells, mediated by the spike (S) viral protein] offers several potential therapeutic targets. The S protein uses the angiotension-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor for entry, but also sialic acids linked to host cell surface gangliosides. Using a combination of structural and molecular modelling approaches, this study showed that chloroquine (CLQ), one of the drugs currently under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 treatment, binds sialic acids and gangliosides with high affinity. A new type of ganglioside-binding domain at the tip of the N-terminal domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was identified. This domain (111\u2013158), which is fully conserved among clinical isolates worldwide, may improve attachment of the virus to lipid rafts and facilitate contact with the ACE-2 receptor. This study showed that, in the presence of CLQ [or its more active derivative, hydroxychloroquine (CLQ-OH)], the viral S protein is no longer able to bind gangliosides. The identification of this new mechanism of action of CLQ and CLQ-OH supports the use of these repositioned drugs to cure patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

In this study, we have selected 40 antiviral phytochemicals to find out the best candidates which can act as potent inhibitors against the main protease. Molecular docking is performed using AutoDock Vina and GOLD suite to determine the binding affinities and interactions between the phytochemicals and the main protease. The selected candidates strongly interact with the key Cys145 and His41 residues. To validate the docking interactions, 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the five top-ranked inhibitors including hypericin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, baicalin, glabridin, and \u03b1-ketoamide-11r are performed. Principal component analysis (PCA) on the MD simulation discloses that baicalin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, and \u03b1-ketoamide-11r have structural similarity with the apo-form of the main protease. These findings are also strongly supported by root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), and solvent accessible surface area (SASA) investigations. PCA is also used to find out the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) for pattern recognition of the best ligands. Multiple linear regression (MLR) of QSAR reveals the R(2) value of 0.842 for the training set and 0.753 for the test set.

However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV\/SARS-CoV-2. Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV\u2013host interactome and drug targets in the human protein\u2013protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV\/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV\/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and HCoV\u2013host interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. We further identify three potential drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the \u201cComplementary Exposure\u201d pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV\u2013host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting 2019-nCoV\/SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":1584316800000,"author_summary":" Zhou, Yadi; Hou, Yuan; Shen, Jiayu; Huang, Yin;<br>Martin, William; Cheng, Feixiong","abstract_summary":" Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including<br>severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus<br>(SARS-CoV) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also<br>known as SARS-CoV-2), lead global epidemics with<br>high morbidity and mortality.

Seven possible SARS-CoV-2 M-pro inhibitors were predicted using this approach: Perampanel, Carprofen, Celecoxib, Alprazolam, Trovafloxacin, Sarafloxacin and ethyl biscoumacetate. Carprofen and Celecoxib have been selected by the COVID Moonshot initiative for in vitro testing; they show 3.97 and 11.90% M-pro inhibition at 50 \u00b5M, respectively.","publish_time":1590537600000,"author_summary":" Gimeno, Aleix; Mestres-Truyol, J\u00falia;<br>Ojeda-Montes, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9; Macip, Guillem;<br>Saldivar-Espinoza, Bryan; Cereto-Massagu\u00e9, Adri\u00e0; Pujadas,<br>Gerard; Garcia-Vallv\u00e9, Santiago","abstract_summary":" Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in<br>December 2019 and its rapid spread worldwide, the<br>scientific community has been under pressure to react and<br>make progress in the development of an effective<br>treatment against the virus responsible for the disease.<br>Here, we implement an original virtual screening<br>(VS) protocol for repositioning approved drugs in<br>order to predict which of them could inhibit the main<br>protease of the virus (M-pro), a key target for antiviral<br>drugs given its essential role in the virus\u2019<br>replication.

The stable state of M(pro) was used to conduct extensive virtual screening of the aforementioned drug pool.

Three hotspot sites having DScore \u22651 (Site 1, Site 2 and Site 3) for ligand binding were selected. Subsequently, high throughput screening, standard precision and extra precision docking process and molecular dynamics concluded three best drugs from two libraries. Two antiviral moieties from Asinex databases (5817 and 6799) have docking scores of \u221210.29 and \u221210.156; along with their respective free binding energies (\u0394G bind) of \u221251.96 and \u221264.36 on Site 3. The third drug, Zidovudine, is from PubChem database with docking scores of \u22129.75 with its binding free energies (\u0394G bind) of \u221259.43 on Site 3. The RMSD and RMSF were calculated for all the three drugs through molecular dynamics simulation studies for 50 ns. Zidovudine shows a very stable interaction with fluctuation starting at 2.4 \u00c5 on 2 ns and remained stable at 3 \u00c5 from 13 to 50 ns. Thus, paving the way for further biological validation as a potential treatment. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Molecular docking resulted in a short list of 35 natural compounds, which was subsequently refined using the FPL scheme. FPL simulations resulted in five potential inhibitors, including three natural compounds and two available HIV-1 PR inhibitors. Finally, FEP, the most accurate and precise method, was used to determine the absolute binding free energy of these five compounds. FEP results indicate that two natural compounds, cannabisin A and isoacteoside, and an HIV-1 PR inhibitor, darunavir, exhibit a large binding free energy to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, which is larger than that of 13b, the most reliable SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor recently reported.

Unfortunately, researchers could not find a registered therapy to treat the infection related to the virus yet. Regarding the fact that drug repurposing is a good strategy for epidemic viral infection, we applied the drug repurposing strategy using virtual screening to identify therapeutic options for COVID-19. For this purpose, five proteins of COVID-19 (3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), Papain-Like protease (PLpro), cleavage site, HR1 and RBD in Spike protein) were selected as target proteins for drug repositioning. METHODS: First, five proteins of COVID-19 were built by homology modeling. Then FDA-approved drugs (2471 drugs) were screened against cleavage site and RBD in Spike protein via virtual screening. One hundred and twenty-eight FDA-approved drugs with the most favorable free-binding energy were attached to the cleavage site and RBD in Spike protein. Of these 128 drugs, 18 drugs have either been used currently as antiviral or have been reported to possess antiviral effects. Virtual screening was then performed for the 18 selected drugs with ACE2, 3CLpro and PLpro and HR1 and TMPRSS2.

RESULTS: Our analyses of this structure have revealed a key potentially druggable pocket where it might be viable to bind pharmaceutical agents to inhibit its ability to infect human cells. This pocket is found at the inter-chain interface that exists between two domains prior to the virion binding to human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein. One of these domains is the highly mobile receptor binding domain, which must move into position to interact with ACE2, which is an essential feature for viral entry to the host cell. Virtual screening with a library of purchasable drug molecules has identified pharmaceuticals currently in use as prescription and over the counter medications that, in silico, readily bind into this pocket. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights possible drugs already in use as pharmaceuticals that may act as agents to interfere with the movements of the domains within this protein essential for the infectivity processes and hence might slow, or even halt, the infection of host cells by this new coronavirus. As these are existing pharmaceuticals already approved for use in humans, this knowledge could accelerate their roll-out, through repurposing, for affected individuals and help guide the efforts of other researchers in finding effective treatments for the disease.","publish_time":1593561600000,"author_summary":" Drew, Elliot D.; Janes, Robert W.","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: Following the recent outbreak of<br>the new coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19), the<br>rapid determination of the structure of the<br>homo-trimeric spike glycoprotein has prompted the study<br>reported here.

First, we sought to identify existing FDA approved drugs that could block coronaviruses from entering cells by binding to ACE2 or TMPRSS2 using a high-throughput AI-based binding affinity prediction platform. Second, we sought to identify FDA approved drugs that could attenuate the gene expression patterns induced by coronaviruses, using our Disease Cancelling Technology (DCT) platform. RESULTS: Top results for ACE2 binding iincluded several ACE inhibitors, a beta-lactam antibiotic, two antiviral agents (Fosamprenavir and Emricasan) and glutathione. The platform also assessed specificity for ACE2 over ACE1, important for avoiding counterregulatory effects. Further studies are needed to weigh the benefit of blocking virus entry against potential counterregulatory effects and possible protective effects of ACE2. However, the data herein suggest readily available drugs that warrant experimental evaluation to assess potential benefit. DCT was run on an animal model of SARS-CoV, and ranked compounds by their ability to induce gene expression signals that counteract disease-associated signals. Top hits included Vitamin E, ruxolitinib, and glutamine. Glutathione and its precursor glutamine were highly ranked by two independent methods, suggesting both warrant further investigation for potential benefit against SARS-CoV-2.

We calculated the total binding free energy (\u0394G(bind)) of both inhibitors and further decomposed \u0394G(bind) into various forces governing the complex formation using the Molecular Mechanics\/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM\/PBSA) method.

The increase in \u0394G(bind) for \u03b1-ketoamide relative to Z31792168 arises due to an increase in the favorable electrostatic and van der Waals interactions between the inhibitor and 3CL(pro). Further, we have identified important residues controlling the 3CL(pro)-ligand binding from per-residue based decomposition of the binding free energy.

In the case of lopinavir, a decrease in van der Waals interactions is responsible for the lower binding affinity compared to \u03b1-ketoamide.

We reveal unexpected molecular similarity between azithromycin and the sugar moiety of GM1, a lipid raft ganglioside acting as a host attachment cofactor for respiratory viruses. Due to this mimicry, azithromycin interacts with the ganglioside-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This binding site shared by azithromycin and GM1 displays a conserved amino acid triad Q-134\/F-135\/N-137 located at the tip of the spike protein. We also show that hydroxychloroquine molecules can saturate virus attachment sites on gangliosides in the vicinity of the primary coronavirus receptor ACE-2. Taken together, these data show that azithromycin is directed against the virus, whereas hydroxychloroquine is directed against cellular attachment cofactors. We conclude that both drugs act as competitive inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the host cell membrane. This is consistent with a synergistic antiviral mechanism at the plasma membrane level, where the most efficient therapeutic intervention probably stands. This molecular mechanism may explain the beneficial effects of hydroxychloroquine\/azithromycin combination therapy in patients with Covid-19.

Even the whole genome have great difference with other CoVs, each ORF has high homology with SARS-CoVs (>90%). Furthermore, domain composition in each ORFs was also similar to SARS. In the DrugBank database, only 7 potential drugs were screened based on the sequence search module. Further predicted binding sites between drug and ORFs revealed that 2-(N-Morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid could bind 1# ORF in 4 different regions ideally. Meanwhile, both benzyl (2-oxopropyl) carbamate and 4-(dimehylamina) benzoic acid have bene demonstrated to inhibit SARS-CoV infection effectively. Interestingly, 2 miRNAs (miR-1307-3p and miR-3613-5p) were predicted to prevent virus replication via targeting 3\u2032-UTR of the genome or as biomarkers. In conclusion, the novel coronavirus may have consanguinity with SARS. Drugs used to treat SARS may also be effective against the novel virus.

The main protease (Mpro) of SARS CoV-2, a key component of this viral replication, is considered as a prime target for anti-COVID-19 drug development. In order to find potent Mpro inhibitors, we have selected eight polyphenols from green tea, as these are already known to exert antiviral activity against many RNA viruses. We have elucidated the binding affinities and binding modes between these polyphenols including a well-known Mpro inhibitor N3 (having binding affinity \u22127.0 kcal\/mol) and Mpro using molecular docking studies. All eight polyphenols exhibit good binding affinity toward Mpro (\u22127.1 to \u22129.0 kcal\/mol). However, only three polyphenols (epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechingallate and gallocatechin-3-gallate) interact strongly with one or both catalytic residues (His41 and Cys145) of Mpro. Molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns) on these three Mpro\u2013polyphenol systems further reveal that these complexes are highly stable, experience less conformational fluctuations and share similar degree of compactness. Estimation of total number of intermolecular H-bond and MM-GBSA analysis affirm the stability of these three Mpro\u2013polyphenol complexes.

The previous epidemics of infections by high-morbidity human coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, prompted the characterization of compounds that could be potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The most promising compound is remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleotide analog prodrug currently in clinical trials for treating Ebola virus infections. Remdesivir inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in tissue cultures, and it displayed efficacy in nonhuman animal models. In addition, a combination of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors lopinavir\/ritonavir and interferon beta (LPV\/RTV\u2013IFN-\u03b2) was shown to be effective in patients infected with SARS-CoV. LPV\/RTV\u2013IFN-\u03b2 also improved clinical parameters in marmosets and mice infected with MERS-CoV.

A feature of the LASSBio Chemical Library worth highlighting is the fact that it is a smart library designed by medicinal chemists with pharmacological activity as the main priority. The great majority of the compounds part of this library have shown in vivo activity in animal models, which is an indication that they possess overall favorable bioavailability properties and, hence, adequate pharmacokinetic profiles. This, in turn, is supported by the fact that approximately 85% of the compounds are compliant with Lipinski\u2019s rule of five and ca. 95% are compliant with Veber\u2019s rules, two important guidelines for oral bioavailability. In this work it is presented a virtual screening methodology combining a pharmacophore-based model and an empirical Gibbs free energy-based model for the ligand\u2013protein interaction to explore the LASSBio Chemical Library as a source of new hits for the inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III\u03b2 (PI4KIII\u03b2) enzyme, which is related to the development of viral infections (including enteroviruses, SARS coronavirus, and hepatitis C virus), cancers and neurological diseases.

This study also enabled the determination of the structural requirements for interactions with the active site of PI4KIII\u03b2, demonstrating the importance of both acceptor and donor hydrogen bonding groups for forming interactions with binding site residues Val598 and Lys549.

These newly formed molecules were further subjected to molecular docking, ADMET filters and MM-GBSA binding energy calculations to select 17 best molecules (named as MP-In1 to MP-In17), which showed comparable binding affinities and interactions with the key binding site residues as the reference ligand. The complexes of these 17 molecules and the reference molecule with SARS-CoV-2-M(Pro), were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations, which assessed the stabilities of their binding with SARS-CoV-2-M(Pro).

We developed a quantitative high-throughput screen to identify efficacious single agents and combination therapies against SARS-CoV-2. Quantitative high-content morphological profiling was coupled with an AI-based machine learning strategy to classify features of cells for infection and stress. This assay detected multiple antiviral mechanisms of action (MOA), including inhibition of viral entry, propagation, and modulation of host cellular responses. From a library of 1,425 FDA-approved compounds and clinical candidates, we identified 16 dose-responsive compounds with antiviral effects. In particular, we discovered that lactoferrin is an effective inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection with an IC(50) of 308 nM and that it potentiates the efficacy of both remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine. Lactoferrin also stimulates an antiviral host cell response and retains inhibitory activity in iPSC-derived alveolar epithelial cells, a model for the primary site of infection. Given its safety profile in humans, these data suggest that lactoferrin is a readily translatable therapeutic adjunct for COVID-19. Additionally, several commonly prescribed drugs were found to exacerbate viral infection and warrant clinical investigation.
