        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine has been reported to improve organ dysfunction in critically ill patients. In a recent randomized controlled trial (Dexmedetomidine for Sepsis in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Randomized Evolution [DESIRE]), we demonstrated that dexmedetomidine was associated with reduced mortality risk among patients with severe sepsis. We performed this exploratory sub-analysis to examine the mechanism underlying improved survival in patients sedated with dexmedetomidine. METHODS: The DESIRE trial compared a sedation strategy with and without dexmedetomidine among 201 mechanically ventilated adult patients with sepsis across eight ICUs in Japan. In the present study, we included 104 patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores of \u2265 23 (54 in the dexmedetomidine [DEX] group and 50 in the non-dexmedetomidine [non-DEX] group). Initially, we compared the changes in the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores from the baseline within 6 days after randomization between groups. Subsequently, we evaluated the variables comprising the organ component of the SOFA score that showed relevant improvement in the initial comparison. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 71.0 \u00b1 14.1 years. There was no difference in the median APACHE II score between the two groups (29 [interquartile range (IQR), 25\u201331] vs. 30 [IQR, 25\u201333]; p = 0.35). The median SOFA score at the baseline was lower in the DEX group (9 [IQR, 7\u201311] vs. 11 [IQR, 9\u201313]; p = 0.01). While the renal SOFA subscore at the baseline was similar for both groups, it significantly decreased in the DEX group on day 4 (p = 0.02). During the first 6 days, the urinary output was not significantly different (p = 0.09), but serum creatinine levels were significantly lower (p = 0.04) in the DEX group. The 28-day and in-hospital mortality rates were significantly lower in the DEX group (22% vs. 42%; p = 0.03, 28% vs. 52%; p = 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: A sedation strategy with dexmedetomidine is associated with improved renal function and decrease mortality rates among patients with severe sepsis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01760967) on January 1, 2013.",

        "abstract": "Mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains unacceptably high at approximately 39%. One of the only treatments is supportive: mechanical ventilation. However, improperly set mechanical ventilation can further increase the risk of death in patients with ARDS. Recent studies suggest that ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) is caused by exaggerated regional lung strain, particularly in areas of alveolar instability subject to tidal recruitment\/derecruitment and stress-multiplication. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that if a ventilation strategy can maintain stable lung inflation and homogeneity, regional dynamic strain would be reduced and VILI attenuated. A time-controlled adaptive ventilation (TCAV) method was developed to minimize dynamic alveolar strain by adjusting the delivered breath according to the mechanical characteristics of the lung. The goal of this review is to describe how the TCAV method impacts pathophysiology and protects lungs with, or at high risk of, acute lung injury. We present work from our group and others that identifies novel mechanisms of VILI in the alveolar microenvironment and demonstrates that the TCAV method can reduce VILI in translational animal ARDS models and mortality in surgical\/trauma patients. Our TCAV method utilizes the airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) mode and is based on opening and collapsing time constants, which reflect the viscoelastic properties of the terminal airspaces. Time-controlled adaptive ventilation uses inspiratory and expiratory time to (1) gradually \u201cnudge\u201d alveoli and alveolar ducts open with an extended inspiratory duration and (2) prevent alveolar collapse using a brief (sub-second) expiratory duration that does not allow time for alveolar collapse. The new paradigm in TCAV is configuring each breath guided by the previous one, which achieves real-time titration of ventilator settings and minimizes instability induced tissue damage. This novel methodology changes the current approach to mechanical ventilation, from arbitrary to personalized and adaptive. The outcome of this approach is an open and stable lung with reduced regional strain and greater lung protection.",

Nevertheless, the risk factors for postoperative pneumonia (POP) are still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive risk factors for POP in HTx recipients. METHODS: In this retrospective study, all patients undergoing HTx between January 2014 and December 2015 were included. All cases of POP occurring until hospital discharge were investigated. The study aimed to determine risk factors using univariate and multivariate Cox regression models. Data are expressed in Odds Ratio [95% CI]. P < 0.05 was necessary to reject the null hypothesis. RESULTS: A total of 175 patients were included without any patients being lost to follow-up, and 89 instances of POP were diagnosed in 59 (34%) patients. Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common pathogens. In the multivariate analysis, the risk factors were preoperative mechanical ventilation (OR 1.42 [1.12\u20131.80], P < 0.01) and perioperative blood transfusion (OR 1.42 [95% CI: 1.20\u20131.70], P < 0.01). POP significantly impacted mortality at 30 days (OR: 4 [1.3\u201312.4], P = 0.01) and 1 year (OR: 6.8 [2.5\u20138.4], P < 0.01) and was associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation, time to weaning from venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and stay in an intensive care unit. Plasma exchanges and intravenous administration of immunoglobulins did not increase the risk of POP.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Predisposing conditions and risk modifiers instead of causes and risk factors have recently been used as alternatives to identify patients at a risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, data regarding risk modifiers among patients with non-pulmonary sepsis is rare. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the multicenter, prospective, Focused Outcomes Research in Emergency Care in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Sepsis and Trauma (FORECAST) cohort study that was conducted in 59 intensive care units (ICUs) in Japan during January 2016\u2013March 2017. Adult patients with severe sepsis caused by non-pulmonary infection were included, and the primary outcome was having ARDS, defined as meeting the Berlin definition on the first or fourth day of screening. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to identify risk modifiers associated with ARDS, and odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals were reported. The following explanatory variables were then assessed: age, sex, admission source, body mass index, smoking status, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, steroid use, statin use, infection site, septic shock, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score. RESULTS: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 594 patients with non-pulmonary sepsis were enrolled, among whom 85 (14.3%) had ARDS. Septic shock was diagnosed in 80% of patients with ARDS and 66% of those without ARDS (p = 0.01). APACHE II scores were higher in patients with ARDS [26 (22\u201333)] than in those without ARDS [21 (16\u201328), p < 0.01]. In the multivariate logistic regression model, the following were independently associated with ARDS: ICU admission source [OR, 1.89 (1.06\u20133.40) for emergency department compared with hospital wards], smoking status [OR, 0.18 (0.06\u20130.59) for current smoking compared with never smoked], infection site [OR, 2.39 (1.04\u20135.40) for soft tissue infection compared with abdominal infection], and APACHE II score [OR, 1.08 (1.05\u20131.12) for higher compared with lower score]. CONCLUSIONS: Soft tissue infection, ICU admission from an emergency department, and a higher APACHE II score appear to be the risk modifiers of ARDS in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis.",

However, data regarding the clinical outcomes of this approach are lacking. The objective of this multicenter prospective observational cohort study was to evaluate lung transplantation outcomes in Korean Organ Transplantation Registry (KOTRY) patients for whom ECMO was used as a bridge to transplantation. METHODS: Between March 2015 and December 2017, a total of 112 patients received lung transplantation and were registered in the KOTRY, which is a prospective, multicenter cohort registry. The entire cohort was divided into two groups: the control group (n = 85, 75.9%) and bridge-ECMO group (n = 27, 24.1%). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in pre-transplant and intraoperative characteristics except for poorer oxygenation, more ventilator use, and longer operation time in the bridge-ECMO group. The prevalence of primary graft dysfunction at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after transplantation did not differ between the two groups. Although postoperative hospital stays were longer in the bridge-ECMO group than in the control group, hospital mortality did not differ between the two groups (25.9% vs. 13.3%, P = 0.212). The majority of patients (70.4% of the bridge-ECMO group and 77.6% of the control group) were discharged directly to their homes. Finally, the use of ECMO as a bridge to lung transplantation did not significantly affect overall survival and graft function.

Generally, patients with these devices have marginal right heart function; therefore, it is important to avoid factors that worsen pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). However, VATS requires one-lung ventilation (OLV) and it tends to cause increase in PVR, leading to right heart failure. In the present case, when the patient was set in a lateral decubitus position and progressive hypoxia was observed during OLV, transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated a dilated right ventricle and a temporally flattened interventricular septum, and the central venous pressure increased to approximately 20 mmHg. Because we anticipated deterioration of right heart function, dobutamine and milrinone were administered and\/or respirator settings were changed to decrease PVR for maintaining LVAD performance. Finally, resection of a bulla was completed, and the patient was discharged in stable condition on postoperative day 37. CONCLUSIONS: The anesthetic management of a patient with LVAD during VATS is challenging because the possible hemodynamic changes induced by hypoxia associated with OLV affect LVAD performance and right heart function. In our experience, VATS that requires OLV will be well tolerated in a patient with LVAD with preserved right heart function, and a multidisciplinary approach to maintain right heart function will be needed.",

The median FRC was higher in the extubation success group than in the extubation failure group (27 versus 21 mL\/Kg, p < 0.001). Reduced FRC was associated with higher risk of extubation failure (odds ratio, 1.14 per each decreased of 1 mL\/Kg of FRC\/pBW, 95% CI, 1.05\u20131.23, p = 0.002).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postoperative hypoxemia in acute type A aortic dissection (AADA) is a common complication and is associated with negative outcomes. This study aimed to analyze the efficacy of low-dose (5\u201310 ppm) inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in the management of hypoxemia after AADA surgery. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, Medical records of patients who underwent AADA surgery at two institutions between January 2015 and January 2018 were collected. Patients with postoperative hypoxemia were classified as iNO and control groups. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared using a propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis. RESULTS: Among 436 patients who underwent surgical repair, 187 (42.9%) had hypoxemia and 43 were treated with low-dose iNO. After PSM, patients were included in the iNO treatment (n = 40) and PSM control (n = 94) groups in a 1:3 ratio. iNO ameliorated hypoxemia at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after initiation, and shortened the durations of ventilator support (39.0 h (31.3\u201347.8) vs. 69.0 h (47.8\u2013110.3), p < 0.001) and ICU stay (122.0 h (80.8\u2013155.0) vs 179.5 h (114.0\u2013258.0), p < 0.001). There were no significant between-group differences in mortality, complications, or length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that low-dose iNO improved oxygenation in patients with hypoxemia after AADA surgery and shortened the durations of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. No significant side effects or increase in postoperative mortality or morbidities were observed with iNO treatment. These findings warrant a randomized multicenter controlled trial to assess the exact efficiency of iNO for hypoxemia after AADA.",

        "abstract": "RATIONALE: There remains significant controversy regarding the optimal approach to fluid resuscitation for patients in shock. The magnitude of care variability in shock resuscitation, the confounding effects of disease severity and comorbidity, and the relative impact on sepsis survival are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate usual care variability and determine the differential effect of observed and predicted fluid resuscitation volumes on risk-adjusted hospital mortality for mechanically ventilated patients in shock. METHODS: We performed a retrospective outcome analysis of mechanically ventilated patients admitted to intensive care units using the 2013 Premier Hospital Database (Premier, Inc.). Observed and predicted hospital mortality were evaluated by observed and predicted day 1 fluid administration, using the difference in predicted and observed outcomes to adjust for disease severity between groups. Both predictive models were validated using a second large administrative database (Truven Health Analytics Inc.). Secondary outcomes included duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital and ICU length of stay, and cost. RESULTS: Among 33,831 patients, observed hospital mortality was incrementally higher than predicted for each additional liter of day 1 fluid beginning at 7 L (40.9% vs. 37.2%, p = 0.008). Compared to patients that received expected (\u00b1 1.5 L predicted) day 1 fluid volumes, greater-than-expected fluid resuscitation was associated with increased risk-adjusted hospital mortality (52.3% vs. 45.0%, p < 0.0001) among all patients with shock and among a subgroup of shock patients with comorbid conditions predictive of lower fluid volume administration (47.1% vs. 41.5%, p < 0.0001). However, in patients with shock but without such conditions, both greater-than-expected (57.5% vs. 49.2%, p < 0.0001) and less-than-expected (52.1% vs. 49.2%, p = 0.037) day 1 fluid resuscitation were associated with increased risk-adjusted hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Highly variable day 1 fluid resuscitation was associated with a non-uniform impact on risk-adjusted hospital mortality among distinct subgroups of mechanically ventilated patients with shock. These findings support closer evaluation of fluid resuscitation strategies that include broadly applied fluid volume targets in the early phase of shock resuscitation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that prone positioning (PP) can increase PaO(2)\/FiO(2) and reduce mortality in moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The aim of our study was to determine whether the early use of PP combined with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) can avoid the need for intubation in moderate to severe ARDS patients. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study was performed in two teaching hospitals. Non-intubated moderate to severe ARDS patients were included and were placed in PP with NIV or with HFNC. The efficacy in improving oxygenation with four support methods\u2014HFNC, HFNC+PP, NIV, NIV+PP\u2014were evaluated by blood gas analysis. The primary outcome was the rate of intubation. RESULTS: Between January 2018 and April 2019, 20 ARDS patients were enrolled. The main causes of ARDS were pneumonia due to influenza (9 cases, 45%) and other viruses (2 cases, 10%). Ten cases were moderate ARDS and 10 cases were severe. Eleven patients avoided intubation (success group), and 9 patients were intubated (failure group). All 7 patients with a PaO(2)\/FiO(2) < 100 mmHg on NIV required intubation. PaO(2)\/FiO(2) in HFNC+PP were significantly higher in the success group than in the failure group (125 \u00b1 41 mmHg vs 119 \u00b1 19 mmHg, P = 0.043). PaO(2)\/FiO(2) demonstrated an upward trend in patients with all four support strategies: HFNC < HFNC+PP \u2264 NIV < NIV+PP. The average duration for PP was 2 h twice daily. CONCLUSIONS: Early application of PP with HFNC, especially in patients with moderate ARDS and baseline SpO(2) > 95%, may help avoid intubation. The PP was well tolerated, and the efficacy on PaO(2)\/FiO(2) of the four support strategies was HFNC < HFNC+PP \u2264 NIV < NIV+PP.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Compared to continuous vibrating mesh nebulizer (VMN), inspiration synchronized VMN has shown increased inhaled dose during noninvasive ventilation; however, its use during aerosol delivery via high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is still unknown. METHODS: An adult manikin was connected to a dual-chamber model lung, which was driven by a critical care ventilator to simulate spontaneous breathing. A HFNC system was utilized with temperature at 37 \u00b0 C while gas flow at 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 L\/min. Inspiration synchronized and continuous aerosol generation were compared at different positions (at the inlet of humidifier vs close to patient). One milliliter of albuterol (2.5 mg\/mL) was used in each run (n = 3). Collection filter was placed at the trachea and was removed after each run. Drug was eluted from the filter and assayed with UV spectrophotometry (276 nm). RESULTS: When nebulizer was placed close to patient, inhaled dose was higher with inspiration synchronized than continuous aerosol generation at all gas flows (p = 0.05) except at 5 L\/min. When placed at the inlet of humidifier, compared to continuous, inspiration synchronized aerosol generated higher inhaled dose with gas flow set below 50% of patient inspiratory flow [23.9 (20.6, 28.3)% vs 18.1 (16.7, 19.6)%, p < 0.001], but lower inhaled dose with gas flow set above 50% of patient inspiratory flow [3.5 (2.2, 9.3)% vs 9.9 (8.2, 16.4)%, p = 0.001]. Regardless of breathing pattern, continuous aerosol delivered greater inhaled dose with nebulizer placed at humidifier than close to patient at all gas flows except at 5 L\/min. CONCLUSION: When the HFNC gas flow was set higher than 50% of patient inspiratory flow, no significant advantage was found in inspiration synchronized over continuous aerosol. However, inspiration synchronized aerosol generated 30% more inhaled dose than continuous with gas flow set below 50% of patient inspiratory flow, regardless of nebulizer placement.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) use was associated with greater mortality in adult acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Nevertheless, HFOV is still frequently used as rescue therapy in paediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS). In view of the limited evidence for HFOV in PARDS and evidence demonstrating harm in adult patients with ARDS, we hypothesized that HFOV use compared to other modes of mechanical ventilation is associated with increased mortality in PARDS. METHODS: Patients with PARDS from 10 paediatric intensive care units across Asia from 2009 to 2015 were identified. Data on epidemiology and clinical outcomes were collected. Patients on HFOV were compared to patients on other modes of ventilation. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality and secondary outcomes were 28-day ventilator- (VFD) and intensive care unit- (IFD) free days. Genetic matching (GM) method was used to analyse the association between HFOV treatment with the primary outcome. Additionally, we performed a sensitivity analysis, including propensity score (PS) matching, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and marginal structural modelling (MSM) to estimate the treatment effect. RESULTS: A total of 328 patients were included. In the first 7 days of PARDS, 122\/328 (37.2%) patients were supported with HFOV. There were significant differences in baseline oxygenation index (OI) between the HFOV and non-HFOV groups (18.8 [12.0, 30.2] vs. 7.7 [5.1, 13.1] respectively; p < 0.001). A total of 118 pairs were matched in the GM method which found a significant association between HFOV with 28-day mortality in PARDS [odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3, 4.4, p value 0.01]. VFD was indifferent between the HFOV and non-HFOV group [mean difference \u2212 1.3 (95%CI \u2212 3.4, 0.9); p = 0.29] but IFD was significantly lower in the HFOV group [\u2212 2.5 (95%CI \u2212 4.9, \u2212 0.5); p = 0.03]. From the sensitivity analysis, PS matching, IPTW and MSM all showed consistent direction of HFOV treatment effect in PARDS. CONCLUSION: The use of HFOV was associated with increased 28-day mortality in PARDS. This study suggests caution but does not eliminate equivocality and a randomized controlled trial is justified to examine the true association.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prone positioning (PP) during veno-venous ECMO is feasible, but its physiological effects have never been thoroughly evaluated. Our objectives were to describe, through electrical impedance tomography (EIT), the impact of PP on global and regional ventilation, and optimal PEEP level. METHODS: A monocentric study conducted on ECMO-supported severe ARDS patients, ventilated in pressure-controlled mode, with 14-cmH(2)O driving pressure and EIT-based \u201coptimal PEEP\u201d. Before, during and after a 16-h PP session, EIT-based distribution and variation of tidal impedance, VT(dorsal)\/VT(global) ratio, end-expiratory lung impedance (EELI) and static compliance were collected. Subgroup analyses were performed in patients who increased their static compliance by \u2265 3 mL\/cmH(2)O after 16 h of PP. RESULTS: For all patients (n = 21), tidal volume and EELI were redistributed from ventral to dorsal regions during PP. EIT-based optimal PEEP was significantly lower in PP than in supine position. Median (IQR) optimal PEEP decreased from 14 (12\u201316) to 10 (8\u201314) cmH(2)O. Thirteen (62%) patients increased their static compliance by \u2265 3 mL\/cmH(2)O after PP on ECMO. This subgroup had higher body mass index, more frequent viral pneumonia, shorter ECMO duration, and lower baseline VT(dorsal)\/VT(global) ratio than patients with compliance \u2264 3 mL\/cmH(2)O (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Although baseline tidal volume distribution on EIT may predict static compliance improvement after PP on ECMO, our results support physiological benefits of PP in all ECMO patients, by modifying lung mechanics and potentially reducing VILI. Further studies, including a randomized\u2013controlled trial, are now warranted to confirm potential PP benefits during ECMO.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Both overfeeding and underfeeding of intensive care unit (ICU) patients are associated with worse outcomes. A reliable estimation of the energy expenditure (EE) of ICU patients may help to avoid these phenomena. Several factors that influence EE have been studied previously. However, the effect of neuromuscular blocking agents on EE, which conceptually would lower EE, has not been extensively investigated. METHODS: We studied a cohort of adult critically ill patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and treatment with continuous infusion of cisatracurium for at least 12 h. The study aimed to quantify the effect of cisatracurium infusion on EE (primary endpoint). EE was estimated based on ventilator-derived VCO(2) (EE in kcal\/day = VCO(2) \u00d7 8.19). A subgroup analysis of septic and non-septic patients was performed. Furthermore, the effects of body temperature and sepsis on EE were evaluated. A secondary endpoint was hypercaloric feeding (> 110% of EE) after cisatracurium infusion. RESULTS: In total, 122 patients were included. Mean EE before cisatracurium infusion was 1974 kcal\/day and 1888 kcal\/day after cisatracurium infusion. Multivariable analysis showed a significantly lower EE after cisatracurium infusion (MD \u2212 132.0 kcal (95% CI \u2212 212.0 to \u2212 52.0; p = 0.001) in all patients. This difference was statistically significant in both sepsis and non-sepsis patients (p = 0.036 and p = 0.011). Non-sepsis patients had lower EE than sepsis patients (MD \u2212 120.6 kcal; 95% CI \u2212 200.5 to \u2212 40.8, p = 0.003). Body temperature and EE were positively correlated (Spearman\u2019s rho = 0.486, p < 0.001). Hypercaloric feeding was observed in 7 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that continuous infusion of cisatracurium in mechanically ventilated ICU patients is associated with a significant reduction in EE, although the magnitude of the effect is small. Sepsis and higher body temperature are associated with increased EE. Cisatracurium infusion is associated with overfeeding in only a minority of patients and therefore, in most patients, no reductions in caloric prescription are necessary.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and effectiveness of different ventilation strategies in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. METHODS: A systematic review of randomized clinical trials aimed at evaluating ventilation strategies for obese patients was carried out. Primary outcomes: in-hospital mortality, adequacy of gas exchange, and respiration mechanics alterations. RESULTS: Fourteen clinical trials with 574 participants were included. When recruitment maneuvers (RM) vs Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were compared, RM resulted in better oxygenation p = 0.03 (MD 79.93), higher plateau pressure p < 0.00001 (MD 7.30), higher mean airway pressure p < 0.00001 (MD 6.61), and higher compliance p < 0.00001 (MD 21.00); when comparing RM + Zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) vs RM + PEEP 5 or 10 cmH2O, RM associated with PEEP led to better oxygenation p = 0.001 (MD 167.00); when comparing Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) 40 cmH2O + PEEP 10 cmH2O vs CPAP 40 cmH2O + PEEP 15 cmH2O, CPAP 40 + PEEP 15 achieved better gas exchange p = 0.003 (MD 36.00) and compliance p = 0.0003 (MD 3.00).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Our recent meta-analysis indicated that vitamin C may shorten the length of ICU stay and the duration of mechanical ventilation. Here we analyze modification of the vitamin C effect on ventilation time, by the control group ventilation time (which we used as a proxy for severity of disease in the patients of each trial). METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and reference lists of relevant publications. We included controlled trials in which the administration of vitamin C was the only difference between the study groups. We did not limit our search to randomized trials and did not require placebo control. We included all doses and all durations of vitamin C administration. One author extracted study characteristics and outcomes from the trial reports and entered the data in a spreadsheet. Both authors checked the data entered against the original reports. We used meta-regression to examine whether the vitamin C effect on ventilation time depends on the duration of ventilation in the control group. RESULTS: We identified nine potentially eligible trials, eight of which were included in the meta-analysis. We pooled the results of the eight trials, including 685 patients in total, and found that vitamin C shortened the length of mechanical ventilation on average by 14% (P = 0.00001). However, there was significant heterogeneity in the effect of vitamin C between the trials. Heterogeneity was fully explained by the ventilation time in the untreated control group. Vitamin C was most beneficial for patients with the longest ventilation, corresponding to the most severely ill patients. In five trials including 471 patients requiring ventilation for over 10 h, a dosage of 1\u20136 g\/day of vitamin C shortened ventilation time on average by 25% (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We found strong evidence that vitamin C shortens the duration of mechanical ventilation, but the magnitude of the effect seems to depend on the duration of ventilation in the untreated control group. The level of baseline illness severity should be considered in further research. Different doses should be compared directly in future trials.",

Therefore, this study compared midazolam sedation after heart surgery in DS and normal children. We retrospectively reviewed patient records in our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of pediatric cardiovascular operations between March 2015 and March 2018. We selected five days of continuous post-operative data just after termination of muscle relaxants. Midazolam sedation was estimated by Bayesian inference for generalized linear mixed models. We enrolled 104 patients (average age 26 weeks) of which 16 (15%) had DS. DS patients had a high probability of receiving a higher midazolam dosage and dexmedetomidine dosage over the study period (probability = 0.99, probability = 0.97) while depth of sedation was not different in DS patients (probability = 0.35). Multi regression modeling included severity scores and demographic data showed DS decreases midazolam sedation compared with controls (posterior OR = 1.32, 95% CrI = 1.01\u20131.75).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Protective mechanical ventilation is recommended for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but it usually requires controlled ventilation and sedation. Using neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) or pressure support ventilation (PSV) could have additional benefits, including the use of lower sedative doses, improved patient\u2013ventilator interaction and shortened duration of mechanical ventilation. We designed a pilot study to assess the feasibility of keeping tidal volume (V(T)) at protective levels with NAVA and PSV in patients with ARDS. METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomized crossover trial in five ICUs from a university hospital in Brazil and included patients with ARDS transitioning from controlled ventilation to partial ventilatory support. NAVA and PSV were applied in random order, for 15 min each, followed by 3 h in NAVA. Flow, peak airway pressure (Paw) and electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) were captured from the ventilator, and a software (Matlab, Mathworks, USA), automatically detected inspiratory efforts and calculated respiratory rate (RR) and V(T). Asynchrony events detection was based on waveform analysis. RESULTS: We randomized 20 patients, but the protocol was interrupted for five (25%) patients for whom we were unable to maintain V(T) below 6.5 mL\/kg in PSV due to strong inspiratory efforts and for one patient for whom we could not detect EAdi signal. For the 14 patients who completed the protocol, V(T) was 5.8 \u00b1 1.1 mL\/kg for NAVA and 5.6 \u00b1 1.0 mL\/kg for PSV (p = 0.455) and there were no differences in RR (24 \u00b1 7 for NAVA and 23 \u00b1 7 for PSV, p = 0.661). Paw was greater in NAVA (21 \u00b1 3 cmH(2)O) than in PSV (19 \u00b1 3 cmH(2)O, p = 0.001). Most patients were under continuous sedation during the study. NAVA reduced triggering delay compared to PSV (p = 0.020) and the median asynchrony Index was 0.7% (0\u20132.7) in PSV and 0% (0\u20132.2) in NAVA (p = 0.6835). CONCLUSIONS: It was feasible to keep V(T) in protective levels with NAVA and PSV for 75% of the patients. NAVA resulted in similar V(T), RR and Paw compared to PSV. Our findings suggest that partial ventilatory assistance with NAVA and PSV is feasible as a protective ventilation strategy in selected ARDS patients under continuous sedation.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the leading cause of death among preterm infants born at < 30 weeks\u2019 gestation. The incidence of NEC is reduced when infants are fed human milk. However, in many neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), it is standard practice to freeze and\/or pasteurize human milk, which deactivates bioactive components that may offer additional protective benefits. Indeed, our pilot study showed that one feed of fresh mother\u2019s own milk per day was safe, feasible, and can reduce morbidity in preterm infants. To further evaluate the benefits of fresh human milk in the NICU, a randomized controlled trial is needed. METHODS: Our prospective multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial will include infants born at < 30 weeks\u2019 gestation and admitted to one of 29 tertiary NICUs in China. Infants in the intervention (fresh human milk) group (n = 1549) will receive at least two feeds of fresh human milk (i.e., within 4 h of expression) per day from the time of enrollment until 32 weeks\u2019 corrected age or discharge to home. Infants in the control group (n = 1549) will receive previously frozen human milk following the current standard protocols. Following informed consent, enrolled infants will be randomly allocated to the control or fresh human milk groups. The primary outcome is the composite outcome mortality or NEC \u2265 stage 2 at 32 weeks\u2019 corrected age, and the secondary outcomes are mortality, NEC \u2265 stage 2, NEC needing surgery, late-onset sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), weight gain, change in weight, increase in length, increase in head circumference, time to full enteral feeds, and finally, the number and type of critical incident reports, including feeding errors. DISCUSSION: Our double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial aims to examine whether fresh human milk can improve infant outcomes. The results of this study will impact both Chinese and international medical practice and feeding policy for preterm infants. In addition, data from our study will inform changes in health policy in NICUs across China, such that mothers are encouraged to enter the NICU and express fresh milk for their infants.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of performing rib fixation with the addition of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) on patients with ARF caused by blunt thoracic injury with ventilator dependence. METHODS: This observational study prospectively enrolled patients with multiple bicortical rib fractures with hemothorax caused by severe blunt chest trauma. All patients received positive pressure mechanical ventilation within 24 h after trauma because of ARF. Some patients who received rib fixation with VATS were enrolled as group 1, and the others who received only VATS were designated as group 2. The length of ventilator use was the primary clinical outcome. Rates of pneumonia and length of hospital stay constituted secondary outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 61 patients were included in this study. The basic demographic characteristics between the two groups exhibited no statistical differences. All patients received operations within 6 days after trauma. The length of ventilator use was shorter in group 1 (3.19 \u00b1 3.37 days vs. 8.05 \u00b1 8.23, P = 0.002).

Most septoplasties aim to improve diurnal and nocturnal nasal obstruction. The evidence base for septoplasty clinical effectiveness is hitherto very limited. AIMS: To establish, and inform guidance for, the best management strategy for individuals with nasal obstruction associated with a deviated septum. METHODS\/DESIGN: A multicentre, mixed-methods, open label, randomised controlled trial of septoplasty versus medical management for adults with a deviated septum and a reduced nasal airway. Eligible patients will have septal deflection visible at nasendoscopy and a nasal symptom score \u2265 30 on the NOSE questionnaire. Surgical treatment comprises septoplasty with or without reduction of the inferior nasal turbinate on the anatomically wider side of the nose. Medical management comprises a nasal saline spray followed by a fluorinated steroid spray daily for six months. The recruitment target is 378 patients, recruited from up to 17 sites across Scotland, England and Wales. Randomisation will be on a 1:1 basis, stratified by gender and severity (NOSE score). Participants will be followed up for 12 months post randomisation. The primary outcome measure is the total SNOT-22 score at 6 months. Clinical and economic outcomes will be modelled against baseline severity (NOSE scale) to inform clinical decision-making. The study includes a recruitment enhancement process, and an economic evaluation. DISCUSSION: The NAIROS trial will evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of septoplasty versus medical management for adults with a deviated septum and symptoms of nasal blockage. Identifying those individuals most likely to benefit from surgery should enable more efficient and effective clinical decision-making, and avoid unnecessary operations where there is low likelihood of patient benefit.

We sought to evaluate whether a very early start of VP, even without completing the initial fluid loading, might impact clinical outcomes in septic shock. METHODS: A total of 337 patients with sepsis requiring VP support for at least 6 h were initially selected from a prospectively collected database in a 90-bed mixed-ICU during a 24-month period. They were classified into very-early (VE-VPs) or delayed vasopressor start (D-VPs) categories according to whether norepinephrine was initiated or not within\/before the next hour of the first resuscitative fluid load. Then, VE-VPs (n = 93) patients were 1:1 propensity matched to D-VPs (n = 93) based on age; source of admission (emergency room, general wards, intensive care unit); chronic and acute comorbidities; and lactate, heart rate, systolic, and diastolic pressure at vasopressor start. A risk-adjusted Cox proportional hazard model was fitted to assess the association between VE-VPs and day 28 mortality. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed also including those patients requiring VP support for less than 6 h. RESULTS: Patients subjected to VE-VPs received significantly less resuscitation fluids at vasopressor starting (0[0\u2013510] vs. 1500[650\u20132300] mL, p < 0.001) and during the first 8 h of resuscitation (1100[500\u20131900] vs. 2600[1600\u20133800] mL, p < 0.001), with no significant increase in acute renal failure and\/or renal replacement therapy requirements. VE-VPs was related with significant lower net fluid balances 8 and 24 h after VPs. VE-VPs was also associated with a significant reduction in the risk of death compared to D-VPs (HR 0.31, CI95% 0.17\u20130.57, p < 0.001) at day 28. Such association was maintained after including patients receiving vasopressors for < 6 h.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intraoperative driving pressure (\u0394P) is associated with development of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC). When tidal volume (V(T)) is kept constant, \u0394P may change according to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)-induced changes in lung aeration. \u0394P may decrease if PEEP leads to a recruitment of collapsed lung tissue but will increase if PEEP mainly causes pulmonary overdistension. This study tests the hypothesis that individualized high PEEP, when compared to fixed low PEEP, protects against PPC in patients undergoing open abdominal surgery. METHODS: The \u201cDriving prESsure durIng GeNeral AnesThesIa for Open abdomiNal surgery trial\u201d (DESIGNATION) is an international, multicenter, two-group, double-blind randomized clinical superiority trial. A total of 1468 patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two intraoperative ventilation strategies. Investigators screen patients aged \u2265 18 years and with a body mass index \u2264 40 kg\/m(2), scheduled for open abdominal surgery and at risk for PPC. Patients either receive an intraoperative ventilation strategy with individualized high PEEP with recruitment maneuvers (RM) (\u201cindividualized high PEEP\u201d) or one in which PEEP of 5 cm H(2)O without RM is used (\u201clow PEEP\u201d). In the \u201cindividualized high PEEP\u201d group, PEEP is set at the level at which \u0394P is lowest. In both groups of the trial, V(T) is kept at 8 mL\/kg predicted body weight. The primary endpoint is the occurrence of PPC, recorded as a collapsed composite of adverse pulmonary events. DISCUSSION: DESIGNATION will be the first randomized clinical trial that is adequately powered to compare the effects of individualized high PEEP with RM versus fixed low PEEP without RM on the occurrence of PPC after open abdominal surgery. The results of DESIGNATION will support anesthesiologists in their decisions regarding PEEP settings during open abdominal surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03884543.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Real-time bedside information on regional ventilation and perfusion during mechanical ventilation (MV) may help to elucidate the physiological and pathophysiological effects of MV settings in healthy and injured lungs. We aimed to study the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and tidal volume (V(T)) on the distributions of regional ventilation and perfusion by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in healthy and injured lungs. METHODS: One-hit acute lung injury model was established in 6 piglets by repeated lung lavages (injured group). Four ventilated piglets served as the control group. A randomized sequence of any possible combination of three V(T) (7, 10, and 15 ml\/kg) and four levels of PEEP (5, 8, 10, and 12 cmH(2)O) was performed in all animals. Ventilation and perfusion distributions were computed by EIT within three regions-of-interest (ROIs): nondependent, middle, dependent. A mixed design with one between-subjects factor (group: intervention or control), and two within-subjects factors (PEEP and V(T)) was used, with a three-way mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: Two-way interactions between PEEP and group, and V(T) and group, were observed for the dependent ROI (p = 0.035 and 0.012, respectively), indicating that the increase in the dependent ROI ventilation was greater at higher PEEP and V(T) in the injured group than in the control group. A two-way interaction between PEEP and V(T) was observed for perfusion distribution in each ROI: nondependent (p = 0.030), middle (p = 0.006), and dependent (p = 0.001); no interaction was observed between injured and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Large PEEP and V(T) levels were associated with greater pulmonary ventilation of the dependent lung region in experimental lung injury, whereas they affected pulmonary perfusion of all lung regions both in the control and in the experimental lung injury groups.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several studies have assessed predictors of weaning and extubation outcome in short-term mechanically ventilated patients, but there are only few studies on predictors of weaning from prolonged mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Retrospective, single-center, observational study at a specialized national weaning center in Germany. Patients\u2019 medical records were reviewed to obtain data on demographics, comorbidities, respiratory indices, and the result of a prospectively documented, standardized spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) upon admission to the weaning center. Respiratory indices assessed were the ventilatory ratio (VR) and parameters derived from calculated mechanical power (MP). Predictors associated with failure of prolonged weaning and failure of the SBT were assessed using a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 263 prolonged mechanically ventilated, tracheotomized patients, treated over a 5-year period were analyzed. After 3 weeks of mechanical ventilation, patients with unsuccessful weaning failed a SBT more frequently and showed significantly increased values for inspiratory positive airway pressure, driving pressure, VR, absolute MP, and MP normalized to predicted body weight and dynamic lung-thorax compliance (LTC-MP). In the logistic regression analyses, variables independently correlated with weaning failure were female gender (adjusted odds ratio 0.532 [95% CI 0.291\u20130.973]; p = 0.040), obesity (body mass index \u2265 30 kg\/m(2)) (2.595 [1.210\u20135.562]; p = 0.014), COPD (3.209 [1.563\u20136.589]; p = 0.002), LTC-MP (3.470 [1.067\u201311.284]; p = 0.039), P(a)CO(2) on mechanical ventilation (1.101 [95% CI 1.034\u20131.173]; p = 0.003), and failure of the SBT (4.702 [2.250\u20139.825]; p < 0.001). In addition, female gender (0.401 [0.216\u20130.745]; p = 0.004), LTC-MP (3.017 [1.027\u20138.862]; p = 0.046), and P(a)CO(2) on mechanical ventilation (1.157 [1.083\u20131.235]; p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for an unsuccessful SBT. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the derived predictors of weaning point to a crucial role of the workload imposed on respiratory muscles during spontaneous breathing. Mechanical power normalized to lung-thorax compliance was independently correlated with weaning outcome and may identify patients at high risk for weaning failure.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In septic patients, multiple retrospective studies show an association between large volumes of fluids administered in the first 24 h and mortality, suggesting a benefit to fluid restrictive strategies. However, these studies do not directly estimate the causal effects of fluid-restrictive strategies, nor do their analyses properly adjust for time-varying confounding by indication. In this study, we used causal inference techniques to estimate mortality outcomes that would result from imposing a range of arbitrary limits (\u201ccaps\u201d) on fluid volume administration during the first 24 h of intensive care unit (ICU) care. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: ICUs at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, 2008\u20132012 PATIENTS: One thousand six hundred thirty-nine septic patients (defined by Sepsis-3 criteria) 18 years and older, admitted to the ICU from the emergency department (ED), who received less than 4 L fluids administered prior to ICU admission MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III). We employed a dynamic Marginal Structural Model fit by inverse probability of treatment weighting to obtain confounding adjusted estimates of mortality rates that would have been observed had fluid resuscitation volume caps between 4 L\u201312 L been imposed on the population. The 30-day mortality in our cohort was 17%. We estimated that caps between 6 and 10 L on 24 h fluid volume would have reduced 30-day mortality by \u2212 0.6 to \u2212 1.0%, with the greatest reduction at 8 L (\u2212 1.0% mortality, 95% CI [\u2212 1.6%, \u2212 0.3%]). CONCLUSIONS: We found that 30-day mortality would have likely decreased relative to observed mortality under current practice if these patients had been subject to \u201ccaps\u201d on the total volume of fluid administered between 6 and 10 L, with the greatest reduction in mortality rate at 8 L.",

        "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) develops due to the narrowing or blockage of arteries supplying blood to the lower limbs. Surgical and endovascular interventions are the main treatments for advanced PAD but alternative and adjunctive medical therapies are needed. Currently the main preclinical experimental model employed in PAD research is based on induction of acute hind limb ischemia (HLI) by a 1-stage procedure. Since there are concerns regarding the ability to translate findings from this animal model to patients, we aimed to develop a novel clinically relevant animal model of PAD. HLI was induced in male Apolipoprotein E (ApoE(\u2212\/\u2212)) deficient mice by a 2-stage procedure of initial gradual femoral artery occlusion by ameroid constrictors for 14 days and subsequent excision of the femoral artery. This 2-stage HLI model was compared to the classical 1-stage HLI model and sham controls. Ischemia severity was assessed using Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging (LDPI). Ambulatory ability was assessed using an open field test, a treadmill test and using established scoring scales. Molecular markers of angiogenesis and shear stress were assessed within gastrocnemius muscle tissue samples using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. HLI was more severe in mice receiving the 2-stage compared to the 1-stage ischemia induction procedure as assessed by LDPI (p = 0.014), and reflected in a higher ischemic score (p = 0.004) and lower average distance travelled on a treadmill test (p = 0.045). Mice undergoing the 2-stage HLI also had lower expression of angiogenesis markers (vascular endothelial growth factor, p = 0.004; vascular endothelial growth factor- receptor 2, p = 0.008) and shear stress response mechano-transducer transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (p = 0.041) within gastrocnemius muscle samples, compared to animals having the 1-stage HLI procedure. Mice subjected to the 2-stage HLI receiving an exercise program showed significantly greater improvement in their ambulatory ability on a treadmill test than a sedentary control group. This study describes a novel model of HLI which leads to more severe and sustained ischemia than the conventionally used model. Exercise therapy, which has established efficacy in PAD patients, was also effective in this new model. This new model maybe useful in the evaluation of potential novel PAD therapies.",

Data collection included areas of antenatal management, delivery room stabilisation, invasive and non-invasive respiratory support, surfactant treatment and elements of supportive care. Univariate and multivariate methods were used to compare data between the two epochs. Comparing care before and after introduction of the national guideline, areas of significant improvement include use of targeted tidal volume ventilation, use of caffeine therapy, oxygen therapy post-surfactant and increasing early use of parenteral nutrition. Areas of poorer management included levels of positive end expiratory pressures and timing of introduction of enteral feeds. Little variation was seen between level two and three units, although gestational age was a significant independent variable for several practices, including delayed cord clamping, stabilisation with intubation, early enteral feeding and caffeine administration. A national guideline for management of RDS in Wales has significantly improved practice in several areas. However, despite a large volume of high-quality evidence and robust guidance, there remains a significant variation in some elements of best practice for RDS management.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to clarify the preferable SBT (T-piece or pressure support ventilation [PSV]). METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception to the 31st of July 2019. We included RCTs involving adult patients (> 18 years) who underwent at least two different SBT methods. All authors reported our primary outcome of successful extubation rate and clearly compared PS versus T-piece with clinically relevant secondary outcomes (rate of reintubation, ICU and hospital length of stay, and ICU and hospital mortality). Results were expressed as odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) with accompanying 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Ten RCTs including 3165 patients were included. The results of this meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the successful extubation rate between the T-piece group and PS group (odds ratio [OR] = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.78\u20131.07; P = 0.27; I(2) = 79%). In addition, compared with the PS group, the T-piece group showed no significant difference in the rate of reintubation (odds ratio [OR] = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.78\u20131.26; P = 0.95; I(2) = 5%), ICU mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 1.22; 95% CI, 0.83\u20131.80; P = 0.30; I(2) = 0%), hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 1.36; 95% CI, 0.99\u20131.87; P = 0.06; I(2) = 19%), ICU length of stay (mean difference = \u2212 0.10; 95% CI, \u2212 0.59 to 0.39; P = 0.69; I(2) = 13%), and hospital length of stay (mean difference = \u2212 0.82;95% CI, \u2212 2.2 to 0.55; P = 0.24; I(2) = 0%). CONCLUSIONS: T-piece and PSV as SBTs are considered to have comparable predictive power of successful extubation in critically ill patients. The analysis of secondary outcomes also shows no significant difference in the rate of reintubation, ICU and hospital length of stay, and ICU and hospital mortality between the two groups. Further randomized controlled studies of SBTs are still required.",

Current guidelines have not yet included standardization or guidance for diuretic-based de-resuscitation in critically ill patients. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a multi-disciplinary protocol for diuresis-guided de-resuscitation in the critically ill. METHODS: This was a pre-post single-center pilot study within the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of a large academic medical center. Adult patients admitted to the Medical ICU receiving mechanical ventilation with either (1) clinical signs of volume overload via chest radiography or physical exam or (2) any cumulative fluid balance \u2265 0 mL since hospital admission were eligible for inclusion. Patients received diuresis per clinician discretion for a 2-year period (historical control) followed by a diuresis protocol for 1 year (intervention). Patients within the intervention group were matched in a 1:3 ratio with those from the historical cohort who met the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: A total of 364 patients were included, 91 in the protocol group and 273 receiving standard care. Protocolized diuresis was associated with a significant decrease in 72-h post-shock cumulative fluid balance [median, IQR \u2212 2257 (\u2212 5676\u2013920) mL vs 265 (\u2212 2283\u20133025) mL; p < 0.0001]. In-hospital mortality in the intervention group was lower compared to the historical group (5.5% vs 16.1%; p = 0.008) and higher ICU-free days (p = 0.03). However, no statistically significant difference was found in ventilator-free days, and increased rates of hypernatremia and hypokalemia were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a protocol for diuresis for de-resuscitation can significantly improve 72-h post-shock fluid balance with potential benefit on clinical outcomes.",

        "doi": "10.1186\/s13613-020-0644-2",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE: It has been suggested that, by recruiting lung regions and enlarging the distribution volume of the cold indicator, increasing the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may lead to an artefactual overestimation of extravascular lung water (EVLW) by transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD). METHODS: In 60 ARDS patients, we measured EVLW (PiCCO2 device) at a PEEP level set to reach a plateau pressure of 30 cmH(2)O (HighPEEP(start)) and 15 and 45 min after decreasing PEEP to 5 cmH(2)O (LowPEEP(15\u2032) and LowPEEP(45\u2032), respectively). Then, we increased PEEP back to the baseline level (HighPEEP(end)). Between HighPEEP(start) and LowPEEP(15\u2032), we estimated the degree of lung derecruitment either by measuring changes in the compliance of the respiratory system (Crs) in the whole population, or by measuring the lung derecruited volume in 30 patients. We defined patients with a large derecruitment from the other ones as patients in whom the Crs changes and the measured derecruited volume were larger than the median of these variables observed in the whole population. RESULTS: Reducing PEEP from HighPEEP(start) (14 \u00b1 2 cmH(2)O) to LowPEEP(15\u2032) significantly decreased EVLW from 20 \u00b1 4 to 18 \u00b1 4 mL\/kg, central venous pressure (CVP) from 15 \u00b1 4 to 12 \u00b1 4 mmHg, the arterial oxygen tension over inspired oxygen fraction (PaO(2)\/FiO(2)) ratio from 184 \u00b1 76 to 150 \u00b1 69 mmHg and lung volume by 144 [68\u2013420] mL. The EVLW decrease was similar in \u201clarge derecruiters\u201d and the other patients. When PEEP was re-increased to HighPEEP(end), CVP, PaO(2)\/FiO(2) and EVLW significantly re-increased. At linear mixed effect model, EVLW changes were significantly determined only by changes in PEEP and CVP (p < 0.001 and p = 0.03, respectively, n = 60). When the same analysis was performed by estimating recruitment according to lung volume changes (n = 30), CVP remained significantly associated to the changes in EVLW (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In ARDS patients, changing the PEEP level induced parallel, small and reversible changes in EVLW. These changes were not due to an artefact of the TPTD technique and were likely due to the PEEP-induced changes in CVP, which is the backward pressure of the lung lymphatic drainage.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to validate a previously published consensus-based quality indicator set for the management of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) at intensive care units (ICUs) in Europe and to study its potential for quality measurement and improvement. METHODS: Our analysis was based on 2006 adult patients admitted to 54 ICUs between 2014 and 2018, enrolled in the CENTER-TBI study. Indicator scores were calculated as percentage adherence for structure and process indicators and as event rates or median scores for outcome indicators. Feasibility was quantified by the completeness of the variables. Discriminability was determined by the between-centre variation, estimated with a random effect regression model adjusted for case-mix severity and quantified by the median odds ratio (MOR). Statistical uncertainty of outcome indicators was determined by the median number of events per centre, using a cut-off of 10. RESULTS: A total of 26\/42 indicators could be calculated from the CENTER-TBI database. Most quality indicators proved feasible to obtain with more than 70% completeness. Sub-optimal adherence was found for most quality indicators, ranging from 26 to 93% and 20 to 99% for structure and process indicators. Significant (p < 0.001) between-centre variation was found in seven process and five outcome indicators with MORs ranging from 1.51 to 4.14. Statistical uncertainty of outcome indicators was generally high; five out of seven had less than 10 events per centre. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, nine structures, five processes, but none of the outcome indicators showed potential for quality improvement purposes for TBI patients in the ICU. Future research should focus on implementation efforts and continuous reevaluation of quality indicators.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Weaning of patients from the mechanical ventilation remains one of the critical decisions in intensive care unit. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of thoracic fluid content (TFC) as a predictor of weaning outcome. METHODS: An observational cohort study included 64 critically ill surgical patients who were eligible for extubation. Before initiating the spontaneous breathing trial, the TFC was measured using the electrical cardiometry technology. Patients were followed up after extubation and divided into successful weaning group and failed weaning group. Both groups were compared according to respiratory and cardiovascular parameters. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the ability of TFC to predict weaning outcome. RESULTS: The number of successfully weaned patients was 41\/64 (64%). Twenty (31%) patients had impaired cardiac contractility, and of them, 13\/20 (64%) patients were successfully extubated. Both groups, successful weaning group and failed weaning group, were comparable in most of baseline characteristics; however, the TFC was significantly higher in the failed weaning group compared to the successful weaning group. The area under the ROC curves (AUCs) showed moderate predictive ability for the TFC in predicting weaning failure (AUC [95% confidence interval] 0.69 [0.57\u20130.8], cutoff value > 50 k\u03a9(\u22121)), while the predictive ability of TFC was excellent in the subgroup of patients with ejection fraction < 40% (AUC [95% confidence interval 0.93 [0.72\u20131], cutoff value > 50 k\u03a9(\u22121)). CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic fluid content showed moderate ability for predicting weaning outcome in surgical critically ill patients.

The negative clinical results may be due to inadequate mean airway pressure (mPaw) settings in HFOV. Our objective was to evaluate the air distribution, ventilatory and hemodynamic effects of individual mPaw titration during HFOV in ARDS animal based on oxygenation and electrical impedance tomography (EIT). METHODS: ARDS was introduced with repeated bronchoalveolar lavage followed by injurious mechanical ventilation in ten healthy male pigs (51.2 \u00b1 1.9 kg). Settings of HFOV were 9 Hz (respiratory frequency), 33% (inspiratory time) and 70 cmH(2)O (\u2206pressure). After lung recruitment, the mPaw was reduced in steps of 3 cmH(2)O every 6 min. Hemodynamics and blood gases were obtained in each step. Regional ventilation distribution was determined with EIT. RESULTS: PaO(2)\/FiO(2) decreased significantly during the mPaw decremental phase (p < 0.001). Lung overdistended regions decreased, while recruitable regions increased as mPaw decreased. The optimal mPaw with respect to PaO(2)\/FiO(2) was 21 (18.0\u201321.0) cmH(2)O, that is comparable to EIT-based center of ventilation (EIT-CoV) and EIT-collapse\/over, 19.5 (15.0\u201321.0) and 19.5 (18.0\u201321.8), respectively (p = 0.07). EIT-CoV decreasing along with mPaw decrease revealed redistribution toward non-dependent regions. The individual mPaw titrated by EIT-based indices improved regional ventilation distribution with respect to overdistension and collapse (p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Our data suggested personalized optimal mPaw titration by EIT-based indices improves regional ventilation distribution and lung homogeneity during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation.",

METHODS: The PARAMEDIC2 trial was undertaken across 5 NHS ambulance services in England and Wales with randomisation between December 2014 and October 2017. Patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who were unresponsive to initial resuscitation attempts were randomly assigned to 1 mg intravenous adrenaline or matching placebo according to treatment packs that were identical apart from treatment number. Participants and study staff were masked to treatment allocation. RESULTS: 8016 patients were enrolled, 4902 sustained a witnessed cardiac arrest of whom 2437 received placebo and 2465 received adrenaline. The odds of return of spontaneous circulation decreased in both groups over time but at a greater rate in the placebo arm odds ratio (OR) 0.93 (95% CI 0.92\u20130.95) compared with the adrenaline arm OR 0.96 (95% CI 0.95\u20130.97); interaction OR: 1.03, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.05, p = 0.005. By contrast, although the rate of survival and favourable neurological outcome decreased as time to treatment increased, the rates did not differ between the adrenaline and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: The rate of return of spontaneous circulation, survival and favourable neurological outcomes decrease over time. As time to drug treatment increases, adrenaline increases the chances of return of spontaneous circulation. Longer term outcomes were not affected by the time to adrenaline administration.

As such, there is urgent need for novel contributions from the scientific literature to abate the growing rates of morbidity and mortality associated with weaning failure. The physician attempting to wean a patient must integrate clinical parameters and common-sense criteria. Numerous studies have striven to identify single predictive factors of weaning failure and sought to standardize the weaning process, but the results are characterized by remarkable heterogeneity. Despite the lack of benchmarks, it is clear that the analysis of respiratory function must include a detailed overview of the five situations described below rather than a single aspect.

We hypothesize that partial preservation of diaphragm function, such as during assisted modes of ventilation, will restore diaphragm thickness. We also aim to correlate the changes in diaphragm thickness and function to outcomes and clinical factors. METHODS: This is a prospective, multicentre, observational study. Patients mechanically ventilated for more than 48 h in controlled mode and eventually switched to assisted ventilation were enrolled. Diaphragm ultrasound and clinical data collection were performed every 48 h until discharge or death. A threshold of 10% was used to define thinning during controlled and recovery of thickness during assisted ventilation. Patients were also classified based on the level of diaphragm activity during assisted ventilation. We evaluated the association between changes in diaphragm thickness and activity and clinical outcomes and data, such as ventilation parameters. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients ventilated in controlled mode and then switched to the assisted mode of ventilation were enrolled. Diaphragm thickness significantly decreased during controlled ventilation (1.84 \u00b1 0.44 to 1.49 \u00b1 0.37 mm, p < 0.001) and was partially restored during assisted ventilation (1.49 \u00b1 0.37 to 1.75 \u00b1 0.43 mm, p < 0.001). A diaphragm thinning of more than 10% was associated with longer duration of controlled ventilation (10 [5, 15] versus 5 [4, 8.5] days, p = 0.004) and higher PEEP levels (12.6 \u00b1 4 versus 10.4 \u00b1 4 cmH(2)O, p = 0.034). An increase in diaphragm thickness of more than 10% during assisted ventilation was not associated with any clinical outcome but with lower respiratory rate (16.7 \u00b1 3.2 versus 19.2 \u00b1 4 bpm, p = 0.019) and Rapid Shallow Breathing Index (37 \u00b1 11 versus 44 \u00b1 13, p = 0.029) and with higher Pressure Muscle Index (2 [0.5, 3] versus 0.4 [0, 1.9], p = 0.024). Change in diaphragm thickness was not related to diaphragm function expressed as diaphragm thickening fraction. CONCLUSION: Mode of ventilation affects diaphragm thickness, and preservation of diaphragmatic contraction, as during assisted modes, can partially reverse the muscle atrophy process. Avoiding a strenuous inspiratory work, as measured by Rapid Shallow Breathing Index and Pressure Muscle Index, may help diaphragm thickness restoration.",

Our aim was to investigate the effects of thoracic trauma on the in-hospital course and outcome of patients with TBI. METHODS: We performed a matched pair analysis of the multicenter trauma database TraumaRegisterDGU\u00ae (TR-DGU) in the 5-year period from 2012 to 2016. We included adult patients (\u226518 years of age) with moderate to severe TBI (abbreviated injury scale (AIS)= 3\u20135). Patients with isolated TBI (group 1) were compared to patients with TBI and varying degrees of additional blunt thoracic trauma (AIS(Thorax)= 2\u20135) (group 2). Matching criteria were gender, age, severity of TBI, initial GCS and presence\/absence of shock. The \u03c7(2)-test was used for comparing categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney-U-test was chosen for continuous parameters. Statistical significance was defined by a p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 5414 matched pairs (10,828 patients) were included. The presence of additional thoracic injuries in patients with TBI was associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation and a prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay. Additional thoracic trauma was also associated with higher mortality rates. These effects were most pronounced in thoracic AIS subgroups 4 and 5. Additional thoracic trauma, regardless of its severity (AIS(Thorax) \u22652) was associated with significantly decreased rates of good neurologic recovery (GOS = 5) after TBI. CONCLUSIONS: Chest trauma in general, regardless of its initial severity (AIS(Thorax)= 2\u20135), is associated with decreased chance of good neurologic recovery after TBI. Affected patients should be considered \u201cat risk\u201d and vigilance for the maintenance of optimal neuro-protective measures should be high.",

RR was started at 10 breaths\/min, and 2 breaths\/min were added every 60 min until 16 breaths\/min was reached. At every point, central venous and arterial blood gas measurements were obtained simultaneously. RESULTS: In this study, gapCO(2) induced by hyperventilation significantly increased, while the central venous carbon dioxide pressure (PvCO(2)) and the partial pressure of CO(2) (PaCO(2)) in arteries decreased. The decreasing trend of the PaCO(2) was more obvious than that of the PvCO(2). HCO(3)(\u2212) and ctCO(2) were markedly decreased, when the RR was increased (P < 0.05). Central venous oxygen saturation (S(cv)O(2)) had a decreasing trend between 14 (77.1 \u00b1 8.3%) and 16 (75.2 \u00b1 8.7%) breaths\/min; however, the difference was not significant.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A noticeable interest in ketamine infusion for sedation management has developed among critical care physicians for critically ill patients. The 2018 Pain, Agitation\/sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep disruption guideline suggested low-dose ketamine infusion as an adjunct to opioid therapy to reduce opioid requirements in post-surgical patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). This was, however, rated as conditional due to the very low quality of evidence. Ketamine has favorable characteristics, making it an especially viable alternative for patients with respiratory and hemodynamic instability. The Analgo-sedative adjuncT keTAmine Infusion iN Mechanically vENTilated ICU patients (ATTAINMENT) trial aims to assess the effect and safety of adjunct low-dose continuous infusion of ketamine as an analgo-sedative compared to standard of care in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation (MV) for \u2265 24 h. METHODS\/DESIGN: This trial is a prospective, randomized, active controlled, open-label, pilot, feasibility study of adult ICU patients (> 14 years old) on MV. The study will take place in the adult ICUs in the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and will enroll 80 patients. Patients will be randomized post-intubation into two groups: the intervention group will receive an adjunct low-dose continuous infusion of ketamine plus standard of care. Ketamine will be administered over a period of 48 h at a fixed infusion rate of 2 \u03bcg\/kg\/min (0.12 mg\/kg\/h) in the first 24 h followed by 1 \u03bcg\/kg\/min (0.06 mg\/kg\/h) in the second 24 h. The control group will receive standard of care in the ICU (propofol and\/or fentanyl and\/or midazolam) according to the KFSH&RC sedation and analgesia protocol as clinically appropriate. The primary outcome is MV duration until ICU discharge, death, extubation, or 28 days post-randomization, whichever comes first. DISCUSSION: The first patient was enrolled on 1 September 2019. As of 10 October 2019, a total of 16 patients had been enrolled. We expect to complete the recruitment by 31 December 2020. The findings of this pilot trial will likely justify further investigation for the role of adjunct low-dose ketamine infusion as an analgo-sedative agent in a larger, multicenter, randomized controlled trial.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several studies have found only a weak to moderate correlation between oxygenation and lung aeration in response to changes in PEEP. This study aimed to investigate the association between changes in shunt, low and high ventilation\/perfusion (V\/Q) mismatch, and computed tomography-measured lung aeration following an increase in PEEP in patients with ARDS. METHODS: In this preliminary study, 12 ARDS patients were subjected to recruitment maneuvers followed by setting PEEP at 5 and then either 15 or 20 cmH(2)O. Lung aeration was measured by computed tomography. Values of pulmonary shunt and low and high V\/Q mismatch were calculated by a model-based method from measurements of oxygenation, ventilation, and metabolism taken at different inspired oxygen levels and an arterial blood gas sample. RESULTS: Increasing PEEP resulted in reduced values of pulmonary shunt and the percentage of non-aerated tissue, and an increased percentage of normally aerated tissue (p < 0.05). Changes in shunt and normally aerated tissue were significantly correlated (r = \u2212 0.665, p = 0.018). Three distinct responses to increase in PEEP were observed in values of shunt and V\/Q mismatch: a beneficial response in seven patients, where shunt decreased without increasing high V\/Q; a detrimental response in four patients where both shunt and high V\/Q increased; and a detrimental response in a patient with reduced shunt but increased high V\/Q mismatch. Non-aerated tissue decreased with increased PEEP in all patients, and hyperinflated tissue increased only in patients with a detrimental response in shunt and V\/Q mismatch. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that improved lung aeration following an increase in PEEP is not always consistent with reduced shunt and V\/Q mismatch. Poorly matched redistribution of ventilation and perfusion, between dependent and non-dependent regions of the lung, may explain why patients showed detrimental changes in shunt and V\/Q mismatch on increase in PEEP, despite improved aeration.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ventilation\/perfusion inequalities impair gas exchange in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although increased dead-space ventilation (V(D)\/V(T)) has been described in ARDS, its mechanism is not clearly understood. We sought to evaluate the relationships between dynamic variations in V(D)\/V(T) and extra-pulmonary microcirculatory blood flow detected at sublingual mucosa hypothesizing that an altered microcirculation, which is a generalized phenomenon during severe inflammatory conditions, could influence ventilation\/perfusion mismatching manifested by increases in V(D)\/V(T) fraction during early stages of ARDS. METHODS: Forty-two consecutive patients with early moderate and severe ARDS were included. PEEP was set targeting the best respiratory-system compliance after a PEEP-decremental recruitment maneuver. After 60 min of stabilization, hemodynamics and respiratory mechanics were recorded and blood gases collected. V(D)\/V(T) was calculated from the CO(2) production ([Formula: see text] ) and CO(2) exhaled fraction ([Formula: see text] ) measurements by volumetric capnography. Sublingual microcirculatory images were simultaneously acquired using a sidestream dark-field device for an ulterior blinded semi-quantitative analysis. All measurements were repeated 24 h after. RESULTS: Percentage of small vessels perfused (PPV) and microcirculatory flow index (MFI) were inverse and significantly related to V(D)\/V(T) at baseline (Spearman\u2019s rho = \u2212 0.76 and \u2212 0.63, p < 0.001; R(2) = 0.63, and 0.48, p < 0.001, respectively) and 24 h after (Spearman\u2019s rho = \u2212 0.71, and \u2212 0.65; p < 0.001; R(2) = 0.66 and 0.60, p < 0.001, respectively). Other respiratory, macro-hemodynamic and oxygenation parameters did not correlate with V(D)\/V(T). Variations in PPV between baseline and 24 h were inverse and significantly related to simultaneous changes in V(D)\/V(T) (Spearman\u2019s rho = \u2212 0.66, p < 0.001; R(2) = 0.67, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Increased heterogeneity of microcirculatory blood flow evaluated at sublingual mucosa seems to be related to increases in V(D)\/V(T), while respiratory mechanics and oxygenation parameters do not. Whether there is a cause\u2013effect relationship between microcirculatory dysfunction and dead-space ventilation in ARDS should be addressed in future research.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The probability of weaning and of long-term survival of chronically mechanically ventilated cancer patients is unknown, with incomplete information available to guide therapeutic decisions. We sought to determine the probability of weaning and overall survival of cancer patients requiring long-term mechanical ventilation in a specialized weaning unit. METHODS: A single-institution retrospective review of patients requiring mechanical ventilation outside of a critical care setting from 2008 to 2012 and from January 1 to December 31, 2018, was performed. Demographic and clinical data were recorded, including cancer specifics, comorbidities, treatments, and outcomes. Overall survival was determined using the Kaplan-Meier approach. Time to weaning was analyzed using the cumulative incidence function, with death considered a competing risk. Prognostic factors were evaluated for use in prospective evaluations of weaning protocols. RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2012, 122 patients required mechanical ventilation outside of a critical care setting with weaning as a goal of care. The cumulative incidence of weaning after discharge from the intensive care unit was 42% at 21 days, 49% at 30 days, 58% at 60 days, 61% at 90 days, and 61% at 120 days. The median survival was 0.16 years (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.33) for those not weaned and 1.05 years (95% CI, 0.60 to 1.34) for those weaned. Overall survival at 1 year and 2 years was 52 and 32% among those weaned and 16 and 9% among those not weaned. During 2018, 36 patients at our institution required mechanical ventilation outside of a critical care setting, with weaning as a goal of care. Overall, with a median follow-up of 140 days (range, 0\u2013425 days; average, 141 days), 25% of patients requiring long-term mechanical ventilation (9 of 36) are alive. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients can be weaned from long-term mechanical ventilation, even after prolonged periods of support. Implementation of a resource-intensive weaning program did not improve rates of successful weaning. No clear time on mechanical ventilation could be identified beyond which weaning was unprecedented. Short-term overall survival for these patients is poor.",

We examined this issue in patients with ARDS enrolled in the Large observational study to UNderstand the Global impact of Severe Acute respiratory FailurE (LUNG SAFE) study. METHODS: In this secondary analysis of the LUNG SAFE study, we wished to determine the prevalence and the outcomes associated with hyperoxemia on day 1, sustained hyperoxemia, and excessive oxygen use in patients with early ARDS. Patients who fulfilled criteria of ARDS on day 1 and day 2 of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure were categorized based on the presence of hyperoxemia (PaO(2) > 100 mmHg) on day 1, sustained (i.e., present on day 1 and day 2) hyperoxemia, or excessive oxygen use (FIO(2) \u2265 0.60 during hyperoxemia). RESULTS: Of 2005 patients that met the inclusion criteria, 131 (6.5%) were hypoxemic (PaO(2) < 55 mmHg), 607 (30%) had hyperoxemia on day 1, and 250 (12%) had sustained hyperoxemia. Excess FIO(2) use occurred in 400 (66%) out of 607 patients with hyperoxemia. Excess FIO(2) use decreased from day 1 to day 2 of ARDS, with most hyperoxemic patients on day 2 receiving relatively low FIO(2). Multivariate analyses found no independent relationship between day 1 hyperoxemia, sustained hyperoxemia, or excess FIO(2) use and adverse clinical outcomes. Mortality was 42% in patients with excess FIO(2) use, compared to 39% in a propensity-matched sample of normoxemic (PaO(2) 55\u2013100 mmHg) patients (P = 0.47). CONCLUSIONS: Hyperoxemia and excess oxygen use are both prevalent in early ARDS but are most often non-sustained.

Median tidal volume (V(T)) was 8 ml [Interquartile Range, IQR = 7.3\u20139] per predicted body weight; median positive end\u2013expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 5 [3 to 5] cmH(2)0. Planned recruitment manoeuvres were used in the 6.9% of patients. No differences in ventilator settings were found among the sub-groups. PPCs occurred in 81 patients (10.3%). Duration of anaesthesia (odds ratio, 1.295 [95% confidence interval 1.067 to 1.572]; p = 0.009) and higher age for the brain group (odds ratio, 0.000 [0.000 to 0.189]; p = 0.031), but not intraoperative ventilator settings were independently associated with development of PPCs. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical patients are ventilated with low V(T) and low PEEP, while recruitment manoeuvres are seldom applied. Intraoperative ventilator settings are not associated with PPCs.",

Our working hypothesis was that very low gestational age infants (VLGAI) < 32 weeks\u2019 gestation require an individualized lung recruitment based on combining both manoeuvers. METHODS: Between 2014 and 2016, 91 and 72 inborn VLGAI, requiring a respiratory support beyond a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) = 5 cmH2O, were enrolled before and after introducing these manoeuvers based on progressive increase in SI up to 15 s, with simultaneous gradual increase in PEEP up to 15 cmH2O, according to the cardiorespiratory response. Retrospective comparisons of the incidence of mechanical ventilation (MV) < 72 h of life, short-term and before discharge morbidity were then performed. RESULTS: Among extremely low gestational age infants (ELGAI) < 29 weeks\u2019 gestation, the following outcomes decreased significantly: intubation (90 to 55%) and surfactant administration (54 to 12%) in the delivery room, MV (92 to 71%) and its mean duration < 72 h of life (45 h to 13 h), administration of a 2nd dose of surfactant (35 to 12%) and postnatal corticosteroids (52 to 19%), and the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (23 to 5%). Among VLGAI, all of these results were also significant. Neonatal mortality and morbidity were not different. CONCLUSIONS: In our setting, combining two individualized lung recruitment maneuvers at birth was feasible and may be beneficial on short-term and before discharge pulmonary outcomes.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pendelluft, the movement of gas within different lung regions, is present in animal models of assisted mechanical ventilation and associated with lung overstretching. Due to rebreathing of CO(2) as compared to fresh gas, pendelluft might reduce ventilatory efficiency possibly exacerbating patient\u2019s respiratory workload during weaning. Our aim was to measure pendelluft by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in patients who failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). METHODS: This is an observational study conducted in a general intensive care unit of a tertiary-level teaching hospital. EIT signal was recorded in 20 patients while pressure support (PS) ventilation was progressively reduced from clinical level (baseline) to 2 cmH(2)O, as in an SBT; four ventral-to-dorsal lung regions of interest were identified for pendelluft measurement. A regional gas movement (> 6 mL) occurring in a direction opposite to the global EIT signal was considered diagnostic for high pendelluft. RESULTS: Eight patients out of 20 (40%) were classified as high-pendelluft; baseline clinical characteristics did not differ between high- and low-pendelluft patients. At PS reduction, pendelluft and EtCO(2) increased more in the high-pendelluft group (p < .001 and .011, respectively). The volume of gas subject to pendelluft moved almost completely from the ventral towards the dorsal lung regions, while the opposite movement was minimal (16.3 [10:32.8] vs. 0 [0:1.8] mL, p = .001). In a subgroup of patients, increased pendelluft volumes positively correlated with markers of respiratory distress such as increased respiratory rate, p0.1, and EtCO(2). CONCLUSIONS: Occult pendelluft can be measured by EIT, and is frequently present in patients failing an SBT. When present, pendelluft increases with the reduction of ventilator support and is associated with increased EtCO(2), suggesting a reduction of the ability to eliminate CO(2).",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fluid resuscitation has become the cornerstone of early septic shock management, but the optimal fluid rate is still not well studied. The goal of this investigation is to examine the relationship between fluid resuscitation rate and septic shock resolution. METHOD: We retrospectively studied adult (\u2265 18 years) patients with septic shock, defined based on sepsis III definition, from January 1, 2006, through May 31, 2018, in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) of Mayo Clinic Rochester. The fluid resuscitation time was defined as the time required to infuse the initial fluid bolus of 30 ml\/kg, based on the recommendations of the 2016 surviving sepsis campaign. The cohort was divided into four groups based on the average fluid rate (group 1 \u2265 0.5, group 2 0.25\u20130.49, group 3 0.17\u20130.24, and group 4 < 0.17 ml\/kg\/min). The primary outcome was the time to shock reversal. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to account for potential confounders. RESULT: A total of 1052 patients met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. The time-to-shock reversal was significantly different among the groups (P < .001). Patients in group 1 who received fluid resuscitation at a faster rate had a shorter time to shock reversal (HR = 0.78; 95% CI 0.66\u20130.91; P = .01) when compared with group 4 with a median (IQR) time-to-shock reversal of 1.7 (1.5, 2.0) vs. 2.8 (2.6, 3.3) days, respectively. Using 0.25 ml\/kg\/min as cutoff, the higher fluid infusion rate was associated with a shorter time to shock reversal (HR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.06\u20131.41; P = .004) and with decreased odds of 28-day mortality (HR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.60\u20130.85; P < .001). CONCLUSION: In septic shock patients, initial fluid resuscitation rate of 0.25\u20130.50 ml\/kg\/min (i.e., completion of the initial 30 ml\/kg IV fluid resuscitation within the first 2 h), may be associated with early shock reversal and lower 28-day mortality compared with slower rates of infusion.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated spinal cord autoregulation using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Here, we assessed spinal cord autoregulation under normal, hypovolemic, and post-fluid resuscitation conditions compared with cerebral autoregulation. METHODS: Ten pigs (36.1 \u00b1 1.1 kg) were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane, before phenylephrine administration at 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 \u03bcg kg(\u22121) min(\u22121) in a stepwise fashion at 10-min intervals (baseline), followed by similar administration of sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Hypovolemia was induced by a 600-ml bleed (25% estimated total blood volume). Only phenylephrine was readministered (same protocol). Hypovolemia was reversed by infusing 600 ml hydroxyethyl starch, before readministering phenylephrine and SNP. The relationships between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cerebral, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord tissue oxygenation indices (TOIs) were evaluated. RESULTS: Thoracic and lumbar spinal cord TOIs were approximately 15% and 10% lower, respectively, than the cerebral TOI at similar MAPs. The average relationship between MAP and each TOI showed an autoregulatory pattern, but negative correlations were observed in the cerebral TOI during phenylephrine infusion. A 600-ml bleed lowered each relationship < 5% and subsequent fluid resuscitation did not change the relationship. Individual oxygenation responses to blood pressure indicated that the spinal cord is more pressure-passive than the cerebrum. Paradoxical responses (an inverse relationship of tissue oxygenation to MAP) were observed particularly in cerebrum during phenylephrine infusion and were rare in the spinal cord. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal cord autoregulation is less robust than cerebral autoregulation and more pressure-dependent. Similar to cerebral oxygenation, spinal cord oxygenation is volume-tolerant but is more sensitive to hypotension.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Loss of vascular tone is a key pathophysiological feature of septic shock. Combination of gradual diastolic hypotension and tachycardia could reflect more serious vasodilatory conditions. We sought to evaluate the relationships between heart rate (HR) to diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) ratios and clinical outcomes during early phases of septic shock. METHODS: Diastolic shock index (DSI) was defined as the ratio between HR and DAP. DSI calculated just before starting vasopressors (Pre-VPs\/DSI) in a preliminary cohort of 337 patients with septic shock (January 2015 to February 2017) and at vasopressor start (VPs\/DSI) in 424 patients with septic shock included in a recent randomized controlled trial (ANDROMEDA-SHOCK; March 2017 to April 2018) was partitioned into five quantiles to estimate the relative risks (RR) of death with respect to the mean risk of each population (assumed to be 1). Matched HR and DAP subsamples were created to evaluate the effect of the individual components of the DSI on RRs. In addition, time-course of DSI and interaction between DSI and vasopressor dose (DSI*NE.dose) were compared between survivors and non-survivors from both populations, while ROC curves were used to identify variables predicting mortality. Finally, as exploratory observation, effect of early start of vasopressors was evaluated at each Pre-VPs\/DSI quintile from the preliminary cohort. RESULTS: Risk of death progressively increased at gradual increments of Pre-VPs\/DSI or VPs\/DSI (One-way ANOVA, p < 0.001). Progressive DAP decrease or HR increase was associated with higher mortality risks only when DSI concomitantly increased. Areas under the ROC curve for Pre-VPs\/DSI, SOFA and initial lactate were similar, while mean arterial pressure and systolic shock index showed poor performances to predict mortality. Time-course of DSI and DSI*NE.dose was significantly higher in non-survivors from both populations (repeated-measures ANOVA, p < 0.001). Very early start of vasopressors exhibited an apparent benefit at higher Pre-VPs\/DSI quintile. CONCLUSIONS: DSI at pre-vasopressor and vasopressor start points might represent a very early identifier of patients at high risk of death. Isolated DAP or HR values do not clearly identify such risk. Usefulness of DSI to trigger or to direct therapeutic interventions in early resuscitation of septic shock need to be addressed in future studies.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients often develop acute respiratory failure. Optimal ventilator strategies in this setting are not well established. We performed an international survey to investigate the practice in the ventilatory management of TBI patients with and without respiratory failure. METHODS: An electronic questionnaire, including 38 items and 3 different clinical scenarios [arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2))\/inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO(2)) > 300 (scenario 1), 150\u2013300 (scenario 2), < 150 (scenario 3)], was available on the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) website between November 2018 and March 2019. The survey was endorsed by ESICM. RESULTS: There were 687 respondents [472 (69%) from Europe], mainly intensivists [328 (48%)] and anesthesiologists [206 (30%)]. A standard protocol for mechanical ventilation in TBI patients was utilized by 277 (40%) respondents and a specific weaning protocol by 198 (30%). The most common tidal volume (TV) applied was 6\u20138 ml\/kg of predicted body weight (PBW) in scenarios 1\u20132 (72% PaO(2)\/FIO(2) > 300 and 61% PaO(2)\/FiO(2) 150\u2013300) and 4\u20136 ml\/kg\/PBW in scenario 3 (53% PaO(2)\/FiO(2) < 150). The most common level of highest positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) used was 15 cmH(2)O in patients with a PaO(2)\/FiO(2) \u2264 300 without intracranial hypertension (41% if PaO(2)\/FiO(2) 150\u2013300 and 50% if PaO(2)\/FiO(2) < 150) and 10 cmH(2)O in patients with intracranial hypertension (32% if PaO(2)\/FiO(2) 150\u2013300 and 33% if PaO(2)\/FiO(2) < 150). Regardless of the presence of intracranial hypertension, the most common carbon dioxide target remained 36\u201340 mmHg whereas the most common PaO(2) target was 81\u2013100 mmHg in all the 3 scenarios. The most frequent rescue strategies utilized in case of refractory respiratory failure despite conventional ventilator settings were neuromuscular blocking agents [406 (88%)], recruitment manoeuvres [319 (69%)] and prone position [292 (63%)]. CONCLUSIONS: Ventilatory management, targets and practice of adult severe TBI patients with and without respiratory failure are widely different among centres.

We therefore aimed to describe its use in clinical practice and predict the risk of mortality for neonates receiving HFOV. A retrospective observational study of all neonates treated with HFOV in a quaternary referral NICU between January 2007 and December 2016 was conducted. We classified these patients into five subgroups based on primary respiratory diagnoses. We performed the logistic regression and decision tree regression analyses to identify independent factors of 30-day mortality following HFOV. A total of 1125 patients who were ever supported on HFOV were enrolled, of whom 64.1% received HFOV as a rescue therapy, 27.2% received it as an elective therapy, and 8.7% received it for air leak. An average oxygenation index (OI) greater than 25 in the first 24 hours after the initiation of HFOV and patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension were found to have the greatest risk of in-hospital mortality (p < 0.0001). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 25.8% (290\/1125). Decision tree regression analysis revealed that neonates with refractory respiratory failure who had a pre-HFOV OI value higher than 20.5 and OI values higher than 21.5, 23.5 and 34 at 2 hours, 6 hours, and 12 hours after the use of HFOV, respectively, had a significantly increased risk of 30-day mortality. We identified the predictors and cutoff points of OI before and after the initiation of HFOV in neonates with respiratory failure, which can be clinically used as a reference for 30-day mortality. Further efforts are still needed to optimize the outcomes.",

Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) provides an efficient rewarming method with complete cardiopulmonary support. The use of VA-ECMO for this indication has greatly improved the vital and functional prognosis of patients. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 46-year-old patient who was treated for severe hypothermia with a temperature of 22.4 \u00b0C along with initial cardiac arrest, whose progression was favorable after the implementation of VA-ECMO support. Two months after initial cardiac arrest, the patient was reassessed and showed signs of complete recovery with regard to his mental and physical capacities. CONCLUSIONS: The recent international publications and groups of experts recommend the use of VA ECMO as the gold standard therapy to treat severe hypothermia. Therefore, it seems suitable to update the current knowledge on the topic by analysing the latest international publications. The performance of this technique calls into question ethical and economic factors. Two distinct medical teams tried to identify and regroup prognosis factors in predictive survival scores. They raise the question of the utility of these scores in clinical practice. Indeed, according to which survival rate should we proceed to prolonged resuscitation and implement VA-ECMO? Additional studies will be needed for external approval of these survival scores, and additional reflection by experts will be required.",

Although a number of studies have reported the usefulness of I-ASV, the clinical situations in which it may be useful have not yet been clarified. We aimed to report our initial 3 years of experience using I-ASV, particularly the clinical conditions and the technical and organizational factors associated with its use. Furthermore, we evaluated the usefulness of I-ASV and determined the predictive factors for successful management with I-ASV. METHODS: This single-center, retrospective observational study included patients who were ventilated using the Hamilton G5\u00ae ventilator (Hamilton Medical AG, Rh\u00e4z\u00fcns, Switzerland) from January 2016 to December 2018. The patients were categorized into the \u201cI-ASV success\u201d group and \u201cI-ASV failure\u201d group (those receiving mechanical ventilation with I-ASV along with any other mode). Multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with successful I-ASV management. RESULTS: Of the 189 patients, 135 (71.4%) were categorized into the I-ASV success group. In the I-ASV success group, the reasons for ICU admission included post-elective surgery (94.1%), post-emergent surgery (81.5%), and other medical reasons (55.6%). I-ASV failure was associated with a low P\/F ratio (278 vs. 167, P = 0.0003) and high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (21 vs. 26, P < 0.0001). The main reasons for not using I-ASV included strong inspiratory effort and asynchrony. The APACHE II score was an independent predictive factor for successful management with I-ASV, with an odds ratio of 0.92 (95% confidential interval 0.87\u20130.96, P = 0.0006). The area under the receiver operating curve for the APACHE II score was 0.722 (cut-off: 24). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that 71.4% of the fully mechanically ventilated patients could be managed successfully with I-ASV. The APACHE II score was an independent factor that could help predict the successful management of I-ASV. To improve I-ASV management, it is necessary to focus on patient-ventilator interactions.",

Our hypothesis was that in primary acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) MV would enhance inflammation and edema in the abdomen. METHODS: Thirteen piglets were randomized into two groups (SB and MV) after the induction of ARDS by lung lavage and 1 h of injurious ventilation. 1. SB: continuous positive airway pressure 15 cmH(2)O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO(2)) 0.5 and respiratory rate (RR) maintained at about 40 cycles min(\u2212 1) by titrating remifentanil infusion. 2.

Main outcomes: abdominal edema, assessed by tissues histopathology and wet-dry weight; abdominal inflammation, assessed by cytokine concentration in tissues, blood and ascites, and tissue histopathology. RESULTS: The groups did not show significant differences in hemodynamic or respiratory parameters. Moreover, edema and inflammation in the abdominal organs were similar. However, blood IL6 increased in the MV group in all vascular beds (p < 0.001). In addition, TNF\u03b1 ratio in blood increased through the lungs in MV group (+ 26% \u00b1 3) but decreased in the SB group (\u2212 17% \u00b1 3). CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences between the MV and SB group for abdominal edema or inflammation. However, the systemic increase in IL6 and the TNF\u03b1 increase through the lungs suggest that MV, in this model, was harmful to the lungs.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is one of the leading causes of intensive care unit admission and is associated with high mortality. Noninvasive oxygenation strategies such as high-flow nasal cannula, standard oxygen therapy, and noninvasive ventilation (delivered by either face mask or helmet interface) are widely available interventions applied in these patients. It remains unclear which of these interventions are more effective in decreasing rates of invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality. The primary objective of this network meta-analysis is to summarize the evidence and compare the effect of noninvasive oxygenation strategies on mortality and need for invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. METHODS: We will search key databases for randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of noninvasive oxygenation strategies in adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. We will exclude studies in which the primary focus is either acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality (longest available up to 90 days). The secondary outcomes will be receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation (longest available up to 30 days). We will assess the risk of bias for each of the outcomes using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Bayesian network meta-analyses will be conducted to obtain pooled estimates of head-to-head comparisons. We will report pairwise and network meta-analysis treatment effect estimates as risk ratios and 95% credible intervals. Subgroup analyses will be conducted examining key populations including immunocompromised hosts. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted by excluding those studies with high risk of bias and different etiologies of acute respiratory failure. We will assess certainty in effect estimates using GRADE methodology. DISCUSSION: This study will help to guide clinical decision-making when caring for adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and improve our understanding of the limitations of the available literature assessing noninvasive oxygenation strategies in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

RESULTS: After introduction of the bCPAP protocol, the median number of days on oxygen decreased in the bCPAP group compared with the conventional ventilation only group (median = 33 days, IQR = 7.5\u201366 vs median = 0, IQR = 0\u20130; P < 0.001).

Porcine models were ventilated mechanically. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was administered endotracheally and in the pulmonary artery to induce ARDS. PFR was measured using a customized particles in exhaled air (PExA 2.0) device. In contrast to control animals undergoing mechanical ventilation and receiving saline administration, animals who received LPS developed ARDS according to clinical guidelines and histologic assessment. Plasma levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 increased significantly compared with baseline after 120 and 180 min, respectively. On the other hand, the PFR significantly increased and peaked 60 min after LPS administration, i.e., ~30 min before any ARDS stage was observed with other well-established outcome measurements such as hypoxemia, increased inspiratory pressure, and lower tidal volumes or plasma cytokine levels.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: RESP score and PRESERVE score have been validated for veno-venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in severe ARDS to assume individual mortality risk. ARDS patients with low-flow Extracorporeal Carbon Dioxide Removal, especially pumpless Extracorporeal Lung Assist, have also a high mortality rate, but there are no validated specific or general outcome scores. This retrospective study tested whether these established specific risk scores can be validated for pumpless Extracorporeal Lung Assist in ARDS patients in comparison to a general organ dysfunction score, the SOFA score. METHODS: In a retrospective single center cohort study we calculated and evaluated RESP, PRESERVE, and SOFA score for 73 ARDS patients with pumpless Extracorporeal Lung Assist treated between 2002 and 2016 using the XENIOS iLA Membrane Ventilator. Six patients had a mild, 40 a moderate and 27 a severe ARDS according to the Berlin criteria. Demographic data and hospital mortality as well as ventilator settings, hemodynamic parameters, and blood gas measurement before and during extracorporeal therapy were recorded. RESULTS: Pumpless Extracorporeal Lung Assist of mechanical ventilated ARDS patients resulted in an optimized lung protective ventilation, significant reduction of P(aCO2), and compensation of acidosis. Scoring showed a mean score of alive versus deceased patients of 3 \u00b1 1 versus \u2212 1 \u00b1 1 for RESP (p < 0.01), 3 \u00b1 0 versus 6 \u00b1 0 for PRESERVE (p < 0.05) and 8 \u00b1 1 versus 10 \u00b1 1 for SOFA (p < 0.05). Using receiver operating characteristic curves, area under the curve (AUC) was 0.78 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67\u20130.89, p < 0.01) for RESP score, 0.80 (95% CI 0.70\u20130.90, p < 0.0001) for PRESERVE score and 0.66 (95% CI 0.53\u20130.79, p < 0.05) for SOFA score. CONCLUSIONS: RESP and PRESERVE scores were superior to SOFA, as non-specific critical care score. Although scores were developed for veno-venous ECMO, we could validate RESP and PRESERVE score for pumpless Extracorporeal Lung Assist. In conclusion, RESP and PRESERVE score are suitable to estimate mortality risk of ARDS patients with an arterio-venous pumpless Extracorporeal Carbon Dioxide Removal.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition that often requires prolonged mechanical ventilation. Tracheostomy is a common procedure with some risks, on the other hand with potential advantages over orotracheal intubation in critically ill patients. This study investigated the association of tracheostomy with health-related quality of life (HRQoL), symptoms of psychiatric disorders and return-to-work of ARDS survivors. METHODS: Data were collected in the context of the prospective observational German-wide DACAPO study. Clinical and demographic patient data and treatment characteristics were obtained from the participating intensive care units (ICU). HRQoL and return-to-work were assessed using patient-reported questionnaires 3, 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge. HRQoL was measured with the Physical and Mental Component Scale of the Short-Form 12 Questionnaire (PCS-12, MCS-12). The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms (depression and post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome-14. Physician-diagnosed anxiety and obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder were recorded by patient self-report in the follow-up questionnaires. The associations of tracheostomy with HRQoL, psychiatric symptoms and return-to-work after 12 months were investigated by means of multivariable linear and logistic regression models. RESULTS: Primary 877 ARDS patients (mean \u00b1 standard deviation: 54 \u00b1 16 years, 68% male) survived and were discharged from ICU. Out of these patients, 478 (54.5%) were tracheotomised during ICU treatment. After 12 months, patient-reported outcomes could be analysed of 388 (44.2%) respondents, 205 with tracheostomy and 183 without. One year after ICU discharge, tracheostomy showed no significant association with physical or mental health-related quality of life (PCS-12: \u2212 0.73 [\u2212 3.96, 2.51]; MCS-12: \u2212 0.71 [\u2212 4.92, 3.49]), symptoms of psychiatric disorders (depression: 0.10 [\u2212 1.43, 1.64]; PTSD: 3.31 [\u2212 1.81, 8.43]; anxiety: 1.26 [0.41, 3.86]; obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder: 0.59 [0.05, 6.68]) or return-to-work (0.71 [0.31, 1.64]) in the multivariable analysis (OR [95%-CI]). CONCLUSIONS: Up to 1 year after ICU discharge, neither HRQoL nor symptoms of psychiatric disorders nor return-to-work was affected by tracheostomy.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: One major limitation for less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) is the difficulty in providing sedation before this procedure and the competitive risk of respiratory depression versus avoidance of intubation for most sedative or analgesic drugs used in this context. The objective of this study is to compare the need for mechanical ventilation within 72 h of life following premedication with propofol, versus placebo (rescue with ketamine), for the LISA procedure in preterm neonates born before 32 weeks gestational age (wGA). METHODS: ProLISA is a phase III, non-inferiority, multicenter, double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial designed according to the SPIRIT Statement. Neonates born before 32 wGA in 12 geographically dispersed Neonatal Intensive Care Units in France needing surfactant will be included from September 2019 to September 2022. A sample of 542 patients is needed. The neonate is randomized to the intervention (propofol) or control placebo group. Open label rescue treatment with ketamine is possible in both groups if FANS (Faceless Acute Neonatal pain Scale) is \u22656. To guide drug administration, FANS is scored before attempting laryngoscopy. Once an adequate score has been obtained, LISA is performed according to a standardized protocol. The primary outcome is the need for mechanical ventilation within 72 h of life. Secondary outcomes are tolerance of the procedure, pain evaluation, hemodynamic and neurologic parameters after the intervention, morbidities before discharge and neurodevelopmental assessment at 2 years of age. DISCUSSION: This paper describes the first multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial on this topic and will provide crucial information to support implementation of the LISA procedure.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To describe ICU stay, selected management aspects, and outcome of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Europe, and to quantify variation across centers. METHODS: This is a prospective observational multicenter study conducted across 18 countries in Europe and Israel. Admission characteristics, clinical data, and outcome were described at patient- and center levels. Between-center variation in the total ICU population was quantified with the median odds ratio (MOR), with correction for case-mix and random variation between centers. RESULTS: A total of 2138 patients were admitted to the ICU, with median age of 49 years; 36% of which were mild TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale; GCS 13\u201315). Within, 72 h 636 (30%) were discharged and 128 (6%) died. Early deaths and long-stay patients (> 72 h) had more severe injuries based on the GCS and neuroimaging characteristics, compared with short-stay patients. Long-stay patients received more monitoring and were treated at higher intensity, and experienced worse 6-month outcome compared to short-stay patients. Between-center variations were prominent in the proportion of short-stay patients (MOR = 2.3, p < 0.001), use of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring (MOR = 2.5, p < 0.001) and aggressive treatments (MOR = 2.9, p < 0.001); and smaller in 6-month outcome (MOR = 1.2, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Half of contemporary TBI patients at the ICU have mild to moderate head injury. Substantial between-center variations exist in ICU stay and treatment policies, and less so in outcome. It remains unclear whether admission of short-stay patients represents appropriate prudence or inappropriate use of clinical resources.

We aimed to establish a modern sTBI protocol for adult patients with both intracranial pressure (ICP) and brain oxygen monitors in place. METHODS: Our consensus working group consisted of 42 experienced and actively practicing sTBI opinion leaders from six continents. Having previously established a protocol for the treatment of patients with ICP monitoring alone, we addressed patients who have a brain oxygen monitor in addition to an ICP monitor. The management protocols were developed through a Delphi-method-based consensus approach and were finalized at an in-person meeting. RESULTS: We established three distinct treatment protocols, each with three tiers whereby higher tiers involve therapies with higher risk. One protocol addresses the management of ICP elevation when brain oxygenation is normal. A second addresses management of brain hypoxia with normal ICP. The third protocol addresses the situation when both intracranial hypertension and brain hypoxia are present. The panel considered issues pertaining to blood transfusion and ventilator management when designing the different algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: These protocols are intended to assist clinicians in the management of patients with both ICP and brain oxygen monitors but they do not reflect either a standard-of-care or a substitute for thoughtful individualized management. These protocols should be used in conjunction with recommendations for basic care, management of critical neuroworsening and weaning treatment recently published in conjunction with the Seattle International Brain Injury Consensus Conference.

The interaction of blood components with the biomaterials of the extracorporeal membrane elicits a systemic inflammatory response which may increase pulmonary vascular permeability and promote the sequestration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils within the lung parenchyma. Also, VA-ECMO increases the afterload of the left ventricle (LV) through reverse flow within the thoracic aorta, resulting in increased LV filling pressure and pulmonary congestion. Furthermore, VA-ECMO may result in long-standing pulmonary hypoxia, due to partial shunting of the pulmonary circulation and to reduced pulsatile blood flow within the bronchial circulation. Ultimately, these different abnormalities may result in a state of persisting lung inflammation and fibrotic changes with concomitant functional impairment, which may compromise weaning from VA-ECMO and could possibly result in long-term lung dysfunction.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Predicting successful liberation from mechanical ventilation (MV) in critically ill patients is challenging. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been proposed to help guide decision-making for readiness to liberate from MV following a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and prospective observational studies that measured BNP levels at the time of SBT in patients receiving MV. The primary endpoint was successful liberation from MV (absence of reintubation or non-invasive ventilation at 48 h). Statistical analyses included bi-variate and Moses-Littenberg models and DerSimonian-Laird pooling of areas under ROC curve (AUROC). RESULTS: A total of 731 articles were screened. Eighteen adult and 2 pediatric studies were fulfilled pre-specified eligibility. The measure of the relative variation of BNP during SBT (\u0394BNP%) after exclusion of SBT failure by clinical criteria in adults yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 0.889 [0.831\u20130.929] and 0.828 [0.730\u20130.896] for successful liberation from MV, respectively, with a pooled AUROC of 0.92 [0.88\u20130.97]. The pooled AUROC for any method of analysis for absolute variation of BNP (\u0394BNP), pre-SBT BNP, and post-SBT BNP were 0.89 [0.83\u20130.95], 0.77 [0.63\u20130.91], and 0.85 [0.80\u20130.90], respectively. CONCLUSION: The relative change in BNP during a SBT has potential value as an incremental tool after successful SBT to predict successful liberation from MV in adults. There is insufficient data to support the use of BNP in children or as an alternate test to clinical indices of SBT, or the use of \u0394BNP, BNP-pre, and BNP-post as an alternate or incremental test.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Invasive mechanical ventilation is lifesaving in the setting of severe acute respiratory failure but can cause ventilation-induced lung injury. Advances in extracorporeal CO(2) removal (ECCO(2)R) technologies may facilitate more protective lung ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome, and enable earlier weaning and\/or avoid invasive mechanical ventilation entirely in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. We evaluated the in vitro CO(2) removal capacity of the novel PrismaLung+ ECCO(2)R device compared with two existing gas exchangers. METHODS: The in vitro CO(2) removal capacity of the PrismaLung+ (surface area 0.8 m(2), Baxter) was compared with the PrismaLung (surface area 0.35 m(2), Baxter) and A.L.ONE (surface area 1.35 m(2), Eurosets) devices, using a closed-loop bovine blood\u2013perfused extracorporeal circuit. The efficacy of each device was measured at varying pCO(2) inlet (p(in)CO(2)) levels (45, 60, and 80 mmHg) and blood flow rates (Q(B)) of 200\u2013450 mL\/min; the PrismaLung+ and A.L.ONE devices were also tested at a Q(B) of 600 mL\/min. The amount of CO(2) removed by each device was assessed by measurement of the CO(2) infused to maintain circuit equilibrium (CO(2) infusion method) and compared with measured CO(2) concentrations in the inlet and outlet of the CO(2) removal device (blood gas analysis method). RESULTS: The PrismaLung+ device performed similarly to the A.L.ONE device, with both devices demonstrating CO(2) removal rates ~ 50% greater than the PrismaLung device. CO(2) removal rates were 73 \u00b1 4.0, 44 \u00b1 2.5, and 72 \u00b1 1.9 mL\/min, for PrismaLung+, PrismaLung, and A.L.ONE, respectively, at Q(B) 300 mL\/min and p(in)CO(2) 45 mmHg. A Bland\u2013Altman plot demonstrated that the CO(2) infusion method was comparable to the blood gas analysis method for calculating CO(2) removal. The resistance to blood flow across the test device, as measured by pressure drop, varied as a function of blood flow rate, and was greatest for PrismaLung and lowest for the A.L.ONE device. CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed PrismaLung+ performed more effectively than PrismaLung, with performance of CO(2) removal comparable to A.L.ONE at the flow rates tested, despite the smaller membrane surface area of PrismaLung+ versus A.L.ONE. Clinical testing of PrismaLung+ is warranted to further characterize its performance.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Prediction of optimal timing for extubation of mechanically ventilated patients is challenging. Ultrasound measures of diaphragm thickness or diaphragm dome excursion have been used to aid in predicting extubation success or failure. The aim of this study was to determine if incorporating results of diaphragm ultrasound into usual ICU care would shorten the time to extubation. METHODS: We performed a prospective, randomized, controlled study at three Brown University teaching hospitals. Included subjects underwent block randomization to either usual care (Control) or usual care enhanced with ultrasound measurements of the diaphragm (Intervention). The primary outcome was the time to extubation after ultrasound, and the secondary outcome was the total days on the ventilator. Only intensivists in the Intervention group would have the ultrasound information on the likelihood of successful extubation available to incorporate with traditional clinical and physiologic measures to determine the timing of extubation. RESULTS: A total of 32 subjects were studied; 15 were randomized into the Control group and 17 into the Intervention group. The time from ultrasound to extubation was significantly reduced in the Intervention group compared to the Control group in patients with a \u2206tdi% \u2265 30% (4.8 \u00b1 8.4 vs 35.0 \u00b1 41.0 h, p = 0.04).

We hypothesized that PSVPro ventilation mode would reduce consumption of anesthetic agents compared with pressure control ventilation (PCV). METHODS: Seventy children between three and eight years of age undergoing elective lower abdominal and urological surgery were randomized into PCV group (n = 35) or PSVPro group (n = 35). General anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane and a Proseal LMA\u2122 was inserted. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol infusion to maintain the entropy values between 40 and 60. In the PCV mode, the inspiratory pressure was adjusted to obtain an expiratory tidal volume of 8 mL\u00b7kg(\u22121) and a respiratory rate of 12\u201320\/min. In the PSVPRO group, the flow trigger was set at 0.4 L\u00b7min(\u22121) and pressure support was adjusted to obtain expiratory tidal volume of 8 mL\u00b7kg(\u22121). Consumption of anesthetic agent was recorded as the primary outcome. Emergence time and discharge time were recorded as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The PSVPro group showed significant reduction in propofol consumption compared with the PCV group (mean difference, 33.3 \u00b5g(\u22121)\u00b7kg(\u22121)\u00b7min(\u22121); 95% confidence interval [CI], 24.2 to 42.2).

The effect of obesity is unclear and has not been shown to independently increase the likelihood of PPCs in trauma patients undergoing trauma laparotomy. We hypothesized the likelihood of mortality and PPCs would increase as body mass index (BMI) increases in trauma patients undergoing trauma laparotomy. METHODS: The Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2010\u20132016) was queried to identify trauma patients \u2265 18-years-old undergoing trauma laparotomy within 6-h of presentation. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the likelihood of PPCs and mortality when stratified by BMI. RESULTS: From 8,330 patients, 2,810 (33.7%) were overweight (25\u201329.9 kg\/m(2)), 1444 (17.3%) obese (30\u201334.9 kg\/m(2)), 580 (7.0%) severely obese (35\u201339.9 kg\/m(2)), and 401 (4.8%) morbidly obese (\u2265 40 kg\/m(2)). After adjusting for covariates including age, injury severity score, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, and rib\/lung injury, the likelihood of PPCs increased with increasing BMI: overweight (OR = 1.37, CI 1.07\u20131.74, p = 0.012), obese (OR = 1.44, CI 1.08\u20131.92, p = 0.014), severely obese (OR = 2.20, CI 1.55\u20133.14, p < 0.001), morbidly obese (OR = 2.42, CI 1.67\u20133.51, p < 0.001), compared to those with normal BMI. In addition, the adjusted likelihood of mortality increased for the morbidly obese (OR = 2.60, CI 1.78\u20133.80, p < 0.001) compared to those with normal BMI. CONCLUSION: Obese trauma patients undergoing emergent trauma laparotomy have a high likelihood for both PPCs and mortality, with morbidly obese trauma patients having the highest likelihood for both.

RECENT FINDINGS: Postoperative respiratory impairment may be due to various causes, such as age, surgery type, comorbidity, smoking, preoperative anemia, and general anesthesia. However, increasing evidence suggests that residual neuromuscular block is an important risk factor for postoperative pulmonary complications and may affect the outcome. Conflicting data from some recent reports show that the use of quantitative neuromuscular monitoring alone does not preclude residual neuromuscular block and that improvements in the interpretation of neuromuscular monitoring may be required. Pulmonary complications seem to be reduced for train-of-four ratios > 0.95 before tracheal extubation compared with > 0.9. SUMMARY: This review stresses the need for appropriate management of neuromuscular block in the prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications but acknowledges that the causes are multifactorial.",

METHODS: This retrospective, observational study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital's pediatric intensive care unit. Thirty-four children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) managed with HFOV were included. RESULTS: Of 34 children with PARDS managed with HFOV after failure of conventional ventilation to improve oxygenation, 8 survived. Improvement in the Oxygenation Index (OI) at 48 h of initiation of HFOV along with percent increase in PaO(2)\/FiO(2) (P\/F ratio) at 24 h of HFOV were predictors of survival. The response to HFOV, based on OI and P\/F ratio, between 24 and 48 h of ventilation identified potential survivors. Also, lower positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on CMV and shorter duration of CMV before initiation of HFOV were associated with survival.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Sepsis survivors have a higher risk of rehospitalisation and of long-term mortality. We assessed the rate, diagnosis, and independent predictors for rehospitalisation in adult sepsis survivors. METHODS: We searched for non-randomized studies and randomized clinical trials in MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and EMBASE (OVID interface, 1992\u2013October 2019). The search strategy used controlled vocabulary terms and text words for sepsis and hospital readmission, limited to humans, and English language. Two authors independently selected studies and extracted data using predefined criteria and data extraction forms. RESULTS: The literature search identified 12,544 records. Among 56 studies (36 full and 20 conference abstracts) that met our inclusion criteria, all were non-randomised studies. Studies most often report 30-day rehospitalisation rate (mean 21.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 17.6\u201325.4%; N = 36 studies reporting 6,729,617 patients). The mean (95%CI) rehospitalisation rates increased from 9.3% (8.3\u201310.3%) by 7 days to 39.0% (22.0\u201359.4%) by 365 days. Infection was the most common rehospitalisation diagnosis. Risk factors that increased the rehospitalisation risk in sepsis survivors were generic characteristics such as older age, male, comorbidities, non-elective admissions, hospitalisation prior to index sepsis admission, and sepsis characteristics such as infection and illness severity, with hospital characteristics showing inconsistent associations. The overall certainty of evidence was moderate for rehospitalisation rates and low for risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Rehospitalisation events are common in sepsis survivors, with one in five rehospitalisation events occurring within 30 days of hospital discharge following an index sepsis admission. The generic and sepsis-specific characteristics at index sepsis admission are commonly reported risk factors for rehospitalisation. REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD 42016039257, registered on 14-06-2016.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Utilization of intracranial pressure monitors (ICPMs) has not been consistently shown to improve mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). A single-center analysis concluded that venous thromboembolism (VTE) chemoprophylaxis (CP) posed no significant bleeding risk in patients following ICPM implementation; however, there is still debate about the optimal use and timing of CP in patients with ICPMs for fear of worsening intracranial hemorrhage. We hypothesized that ICPM use is associated with increased time to VTE CP and thus increased VTE in patients with severe TBI. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2010\u20132016) was performed to compare severe TBI patients with and without ICPMs. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was completed. RESULTS: From 35,673 patients with severe TBI, 12,487 (35%) had an ICPM. Those with ICPMs had a higher rate of VTE CP (64.3% vs. 49.4%, p < 0.001) but a longer median time to CP initiation (5 vs. 4 days, p < 0.001) as well as a longer hospital length of stay (LOS) (18 vs. 9 days, p < 0.001) compared to those without ICPMs. After adjusting for covariates, ICPM use was found to be associated with a higher risk of VTE (9.2% vs 4.3%, OR = 1.75, CI = 1.42\u20132.15, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to patients without ICPMs, those with ICPMs had a longer delay to initiation of CP leading to an increase in VTE. In addition, there was a nearly two-fold higher associated risk for VTE in patients with ICPMs even when controlling for known VTE risk factors.

Few studies have examined the impact of frailty on outcomes for patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the association of frailty with postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. METHODS: Patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystectomy were identified from 2005 to 2010 in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP). The Modified Frailty Index (mFI) was used a surrogate for frailty, and patients were stratified as non-frail (mFI 0), low frailty (mFI 1\u20132), intermediate frailty (mFI 3\u20134) and high frailty (mFI \u2265 5). Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed. Receiver operator curves (ROC) and an area under the curve (AUC) were generated to determine accuracy of mFI in predicting postoperative morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: Of the 6898 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 3245 (47%) patients were non-frail. There were 2913 (42%) patients with low-frailty, 649 (9%) patients with intermediate frailty, and 91 (2%) with high frailty.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bubble continuous positive airway pressure is an established therapy for infants in respiratory distress. In resource-limited settings, few treatment options exist for infants requiring further respiratory support. A bubble bilevel device has been developed to provide nonelectric, time-cycled, pressure-limited respiratory support. We compared the efficacy of bubble bilevel ventilation with conventional mechanical ventilation in sedated rabbits. METHODS: Six adult rabbits under inhaled isoflurane general anesthesia were ventilated by alternating intervals of conventional and bubble bilevel ventilation for three 10\u221215-min periods. During each period, interval arterial blood gas (ABG) measurements were obtained after at least 10 min on the respective mode of ventilation. RESULTS: The bubble bilevel system was able to deliver the following pressures: 20\/7, 15\/5, 12\/5, 8\/5 cm H(2)O. The estimated differences in arterial blood gas values on bubble bilevel vs. ventilator were as follows (normalized values): pH 7.41 vs. 7.40, pCO(2) 37.7 vs. 40, pO(2) 97.6 vs. 80. In addition, the bubble bilevel ventilation delivered consistent pressure waveforms without interruption for over 60 min on two rabbits. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates promising in vivo results on the efficacy of a novel bubble bilevel device, which may prove useful for infants in respiratory distress. IMPACT: Given the lack of personnel, funds or infrastructure to provide neonatal mechanical ventilation in resource-limited settings, additional low-cost, low-tech treatments are necessary to save infant lives. Bubble bilevel ventilation reliably delivers two levels of airway pressure to anesthetized rabbits resulting in normalization of blood gases comparable to those achieved on a traditional ventilator. If proven effective, simple technologies like this device have the potential to significantly impact neonatal mortality due to respiratory distress globally.",

The European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) developed guidelines for the use of noninvasive respiratory support techniques in the hypoxaemic patient in the peri-operative and periprocedural period. The panel outlined five clinical questions regarding treatment with noninvasive respiratory support techniques [conventional oxygen therapy (COT), high flow nasal cannula, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)] for hypoxaemic patients with acute peri-operative\/periprocedural respiratory failure. The goal was to assess the available literature on the various noninvasive respiratory support techniques, specifically studies that included adult participants with hypoxaemia in the peri-operative\/periprocedural period. The literature search strategy was developed by a Cochrane Anaesthesia and Intensive Care trial search specialist in close collaboration with the panel members and the ESA group methodologist. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to assess the level of evidence and to grade recommendations. The final process was then validated by both ESA and ESICM scientific committees. Among 19 recommendations, the two grade 1B recommendations state that: in the peri-operative\/periprocedural hypoxaemic patient, the use of either NIPPV or CPAP (based on local expertise) is preferred to COT for improvement of oxygenation; and that the panel suggests using NIPPV or CPAP immediately post-extubation for hypoxaemic patients at risk of developing acute respiratory failure after abdominal surgery.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The optimal surgical strategy for pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PA\/VSD) in neonates and young infants is controversial. Staged repair may be associated with a higher risk of inter-stage mortality, while primary repair may lead to frequent post-repair re-interventions. METHODS: From 2004 to 2017, 65 patients with PA\/VSD who underwent surgical intervention before 90 days of age were identified and enrolled in this retrospective study. The cohort was divided into two groups: group-SR, who underwent initial palliation with staged repair (n = 50), and group-PR who underwent primary repair (n = 15). RESULTS: There were three post-palliation in-hospital mortalities, four inter-stage mortalities, and one post-repair in-hospital mortality in group-SR. In group-PR, there was one in-hospital death and one late death. Five-year survival rates were comparable between the two groups (group-SR: 83.6%; group-PR: 86.7%; p = 0.754). During the median follow-up duration of 44.7 months (Inter-quartile range, 19\u2013109 months), 40 post-repair re-interventions (22 in group-SR, 18 in group-PR) were performed in 26 patients (18 in group-SR, 8 in group-PR). On Cox proportional hazards model, primary repair was identified as the only risk factor for decreased time to death\/1st post-repair re-intervention (Hazard ratio (HR): 2.3, p = 0.049) and death\/2nd post-repair re-intervention (HR 2.91, p = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: A staged repair strategy, compared with primary repair, was associated with comparable overall survival with less frequent re-interventions after repair in young infants with PA\/VSD. Lowering the inter-stage mortality after initial palliation by vigilant outpatient care and aggressive home monitoring may be the key to better surgical outcomes in this subset. GRAPHIC ABSTRACT: Surgical outcomes of PA with VSD according to the surgical strategies. Patient 1 (birth weight: 2.7 kg) underwent primary Rastelli-type repair at post-natal day # 50 (body weight: 3.8 kg) using Contegra\u00ae 12 mm. The postoperative course was rocky, with long ventilatory support (10 days), ICU stay (14 days), and hospital stay (20 days). Cardiac CT scan at 9 months post-repair showed severe branch pulmonary artery stenosis, which necessitated LPA stenting at 12 months post-repair and RV-PA conduit replacement with extensive pulmonary artery reconstruction at 25 months post-repair. Patient 2 (birth weight: 2.5 kg) underwent RMBT at post-natal day #30 (body weight: 3.4 kg) using 4 mm PTFE vascular graft and staged Rastelli-type repair at post-natal 11 months using a hand-made Gore-Tex valved conduit (14 mm). No post-repair re-intervention has been performed. Cardiac CT scan at 90 months post-repair showed no branch pulmonary artery stenosis.

METHODS: This retrospective, single-center cohort study included 562 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac surgery in a tertiary hospital from January 2015 to December 2016. We assessed VS occurrence and its relationship with HD duration and other risk factors. To assess the effect of the HD duration on VS occurrence, we constructed ordinal variables: HD = 0 (non-HD), 0 < HD \u2264 5 (HD \u2264 5 years), 5 < HD \u2264 10, and 10 < HD. RESULTS: The overall mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) age of patients was (73 \u00b1 11) years, and there were 60.9% men. Forty-one patients (7.3%) were HD dependent. Cardiac surgeries included all coronary artery bypass graft procedures, all valvular procedures, and aortic surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Sixty-six patients (10%) developed VS. Most preoperative patient characteristics were comparable between the VS and no-VS groups; a chronic HD status and a total CPB time of > 180 min were significantly more common in the VS group (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.02, respectively). Longer term HD significantly correlated with VS incidence (P < 0.0001). Ordinal variables for the HD duration and age and known risk factors for VS (preoperative use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, low left-ventricular ejection fraction, and CPB time > 180 min) were subjected to multivariate regression analysis. Long-term HD was identified as an independent predictor of VS (odds ratio, 2.29, 95% confidence interval, 1.66\u20133.18). CONCLUSIONS: Longer term HD may be associated with a higher VS incidence after cardiac surgery. VS should be given attention after cardiac surgery in chronic HD-dependent patients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Optimising techniques to wean patients from invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) remains a key goal of intensive care practice. The use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) as a weaning strategy (transitioning patients who are difficult to wean to early NIV) may reduce mortality, ventilator-associated pneumonia and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to determine the cost effectiveness of protocolised weaning, including early extubation onto NIV, compared with weaning without NIV in a UK National Health Service setting. METHODS: We conducted an economic evaluation alongside a multicentre randomised controlled trial. Patients were randomised to either protocol-directed weaning from mechanical ventilation or ongoing IMV with daily spontaneous breathing trials. The primary efficacy outcome was time to liberation from ventilation. Bivariate regression of costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) provided estimates of the incremental cost per QALY and incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) overall and for subgroups [presence\/absence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and operative status]. Long-term cost effectiveness was determined through extrapolation of survival curves using flexible parametric modelling. RESULTS: NIV was associated with a mean INMB of \u00a3620 ($US885) (cost-effectiveness threshold of \u00a320,000 per QALY) with a corresponding probability of 58% that NIV is cost effective. The probability that NIV is cost effective was higher for those with COPD (84%). NIV was cost effective over 5 years, with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \u00a34618 ($US6594 per QALY gained). CONCLUSIONS: The probability of NIV being cost effective relative to weaning without NIV ranged between 57 and 59% overall and between 82 and 87% for the COPD subgroup.

Two medically complicated patients died a few months after surgery unrelated to surgical complications. Four out of 8 ventilator-dependent patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 1 month after ASD closure. Closure of ASD did not improve those patients with highly advanced lung disease and\/or medically complex conditions including underlying genetic abnormalities. Surgical complications were uncommon.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the role of left ventricular overload and cumulated fluid balance in the development weaning-induced pulmonary edema (WIPO). METHODS: Ventilated patients in sinus rhythm with COPD and\/or heart failure (ejection fraction \u2264 40%) were studied. Echocardiography was performed immediately before and during a 30-min spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) using a T-tube. Patients who failed were treated according to echocardiography results before undergoing a second SBT. RESULTS: Twelve of 59 patients failed SBT, all of them developing WIPO. Patients who succeeded SBT had lower body weight (\u2212 2.5 kg [\u2212 4.8; \u2212 1] vs. + 0.75 kg [\u2212 2.95; + 5.57]: p = 0.02) and cumulative fluid balance (\u2212 2326 ml [\u2212 3715; + 863] vs. + 143 ml [\u2212 2654; + 4434]: p = 0.007) than those who developed WIPO. SBT-induced central hemodynamic changes were more pronounced in patients who developed WIPO, with higher E wave velocity (122 cm\/s [92; 159] vs. 93 cm\/s [74; 109]: p = 0.017) and E\/A ratio (2.1 [1.2; 3.6] vs. 0.9 [0.8; 1.4]: p = 0.001), and shorter E wave deceleration time (85 ms [72; 125] vs. 147 ms [103; 175]: p = 0.004). After echocardiography-guided treatment, all patients who failed the first SBT were successfully extubated. Fluid balance was then negative (\u2212 2224 ml [\u2212 7056; + 100] vs. + 146 ml [\u2212 2654; + 4434]: p = 0.005). Left ventricular filling pressures were lower (E\/E\u2032: 7.3 [5; 10.4] vs. 8.9 [5.9; 13.1]: p = 0.028); SBT-induced increase in E wave velocity (+ 10.6% [\u2212 2.7\/ + 18] vs. + 25.6% [+ 12.7\/ + 49]: p = 0.037) and of mitral regurgitation area were significantly smaller. CONCLUSION: In high-risk patients, WIPO appears related to overloaded left ventricle associated with excessive fluid balance.

We aimed to describe the causes of organ failure and mortality related to gastrectomy for gastric cancer and to identify patients with POF who are at a risk of failure to rescue (FTR). METHODS: The study examined patients with POF or in-hospital mortality in Seoul National University Hospital between 2005 and 2014. We identified patients at a high risk of FTR by analyzing laboratory findings, complication data, intensive care unit records, and risk scoring including Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) 3 at ICU admission. RESULTS: Among the 7304 patients who underwent gastrectomy, 80 (1.1%) were identified with Clavien\u2013Dindo classification (CDC) grade \u2265 IVa. The numbers of patients with CDC grade IVa, IVb, and V were 48 (0.66%), 11 (0.15%), and 21 (0.29%), respectively. Pulmonary failure (43.8%), surgical site complication (27.5%), and cardiac failure (13.8%) were the most common causes of POF and mortality. Cancer progression (100%) and cardiac events (45.5%) showed high FTR rates. In univariate analysis, acidosis, hypoalbuminemia, SOFA, APACHE IV, and SAPS 3 were identified as risk factors for FTR (P < 0.05). Finally, SAPS 3 was identified as an independent predictive factor for FTR. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer progression and acute cardiac failure were the most lethal causes of FTR. SAPS 3 is an independent predictor of FTR among POF patients after gastrectomy.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) who require mechanical ventilation (MV) are regarded as candidates for early tracheostomy because of the high risk of prolonged MV; however, the association between early tracheostomy and favorable outcomes in patients with GBS remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the association between early tracheostomy and outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients with GBS. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included adult patients with GBS identified in the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination national inpatient database from July 1, 2010, to March 31, 2018, who initiated MV within the first week of admission and who received MV for more than 1 week. Early tracheostomy was defined as tracheostomy performed within 7 days of MV. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcomes were 28-day mortality, nosocomial pneumonia, length of hospital stay, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, duration of MV, duration of sedation, duration of analgesia, duration of delirium, and total hospitalization costs. Propensity scores for early tracheostomy were calculated using a logistic regression model on the following variables: age; sex; body mass index; Japan Coma Scale status at admission; Charlson comorbidity index score; comorbidity of chronic pulmonary disease; complication of pneumonia at admission; complication of hyponatremia at admission; neurological presentation at admission; ambulance use; referral from other hospitals; treatment year; days from hospital admission to MV initiation; ICU admission until the day of MV initiation; and treatments until the day of MV initiation. Stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses was performed to compare the outcomes between patients with and without early tracheostomy. RESULTS: Among 919 eligible patients, 654 patients (71%) underwent tracheostomy, with 136 patients (15%) receiving early tracheostomy. Overall, the median time from initiation of MV to tracheostomy was 12 days (interquartile range 8\u201315 days). After stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting, early tracheostomy was not associated with lower in-hospital mortality (risk difference 0.4%; 95% confidence interval \u2212 5.6 to 6.7%) compared with patients without early tracheostomy. There were no significant differences in 28-day mortality (risk difference \u2212 1.3%; 95% confidence interval \u2212 3.5 to 0.9%) and incidence of nosocomial pneumonia (risk difference \u2212 2.6%; 95% confidence interval \u2212 9.1 to 4.2%) between the two groups. None of the other secondary outcomes differed significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Early tracheostomy was not significantly associated with decreased mortality or morbidity in patients with GBS requiring MV for more than 1 week.",

We hypothesized that in more severely injured patients (GCS 3\u20134), there would be a decreased mortality associated with invasive monitoring devices. METHODS: The pediatric Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) was queried for patients aged \u2264 16 years meeting criteria for invasive monitors. Our primary outcome was mortality. Patients with ICP monitoring were compared to those without. A logistic regression was used to examine the risk of mortality. RESULTS: Of 3,808 patients, 685 (18.0%) underwent ICP monitoring. ICP monitors were associated with increased risk of mortality (OR 1.82, CI 1.36\u20132.44, p < 0.001). A secondary analysis including type of invasive ICP monitor and dividing GCS into 3 categories revealed both intraventricular drain (OR 1.89, CI 1.3\u20132.7, p = 0.001) and intraparenchymal pressure monitor (OR 1.86, CI 1.32\u20132.6, p < 0.001) to be independently associated with an increased likelihood of mortality regardless of GCS, while intraparenchymal oxygen monitoring was not (OR 0.47, CI 0.11\u20132.05, p = 0.316). The strongest effect was seen in those patients with a GCS of 5\u20136. CONCLUSION: ICP monitors are an independent risk factor for mortality, particularly with intraventricular drains and intraparenchymal monitors in patients with a GCS 5\u20136.",

DESIGN: Retrospective review of previously prospectively gathered data. SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary care referral hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-three children with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring in place. INTERVENTIONS: TCD evaluation of the middle cerebral arteries was performed daily. CPP at the time of the TCD examination was recorded. For method 1, estimated cerebral perfusion pressure (CPPe) was calculated as: CPPe = MAP \u00d7 (diastolic flow (Vd)\/mean flow (Vm)) + 14. For method 2, critical closing pressure (CrCP) was identified as the intercept point on the x-axis of the linear regression line of blood pressure and flow velocity parameters. CrCP\/CPPe was then calculated as MAP-CrCP. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One hundred eight paired measurements were available. Using patient averaged data, correlation between CPP and CPPe was significant (r = 0.78, p = < 0.001). However, on Bland-Altman plots, bias was 3.7 mmHg with 95% limits of agreement of \u2212 17 to + 25 for CPPe. Using patient averaged data, correlation between CPP and CrCP\/CPPe was significant (r = 0.59, p = < 0.001), but again bias was high at 11 mmHg with wide 95% limits of agreement of \u2212 15 to + 38 mmHg.

        "abstract": "General anaesthesia is sometimes favoured over regional anaesthesia in ophthalmic surgery. The use of supraglottic airway (SGA) or laryngeal mask airway (LMA) as the primary airway device is increasing due to numerous advantages over tracheal intubation. Compared with 1st generation SGAs, 2nd generation SGAs have an added benefit of isolating the airway from the alimentary tract. However, the vertical profile of SGAs may encroach into the surgical field and hence interfere with surgery. We investigated the vertical projections of 1st generation SGAs (LMA Classic, Ambu AuraFlex) and commonly used 2nd generation SGAs in our institution (LMA ProSeal, LMA Supreme, LMA Protector, Ambu AuraGain and I-gel) in a manikin model. Each device was connected to a corrugated catheter mount or angled connector following insertion as per usual clinical practice in our institutions. Vertical projections of all devices were measured from the chin using a centimetre ruler. Securing of airway device to the chin with an adhesive tape was possible for the LMA Classic and Ambu AuraFlex with straight corrugated connector, whereas the stiffer 2nd generations SGAs required the addition of an angled connector or straight corrugated tubing to direct the airway tube caudally, away from the surgical field. The LMA ProSeal had the lowest vertical projection amongst the 2nd generation SGAs and may be the suitable choice for ophthalmic surgery. We also describe a novel technique of utilising a 1st generation SGA with placement of an orogastric tube, although with some reservations. This study has several limitations and transferability of our findings into clinical practice is questionable as the use of a manikin may not fully imitate the real condition of the patient. Our study is the first study comparing vertical projected height of different SGAs in manikin, but future studies should investigate the use of SGA in the clinical setting during ophthalmic surgery.",

SETTING: All departments for SCI-care in Germany. METHODS: The clinical decision-making on SCI-AP and the utility of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for diagnosis of \u2018clinically defined pneumonia\u2019 were assessed by means of a standardized questionnaire including eight case vignettes of suspected SCI-AP. The diagnostic decisions based on the case information were analysed using classification and regression trees (CART). RESULTS: The majority of responding departments were aware of the CDC-criteria (88%). In the clinical vignettes, 38\u201381% of the departments diagnosed SCI-AP in accordance with the CDC-criteria and 7\u201341% diagnosed SCI-AP in deviation from the CDC-criteria. The diagnostic agreement was not associated with the availability of standard operating procedures for SCI-AP management in the departments. CART analysis identified radiological findings, fever, and worsened gas exchange as most important for the decision on SCI-AP. Frequently requested supplementary diagnostics were microbiological analyses, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin. For empirical antibiotic therapy, the departments used (acyl-)aminopenicillins\/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins, or combinations of (acyl-)aminopenicillins\/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors with fluoroquinolones or carbapenems.

        "abstract": "Geriatric trauma patients (GTP) (age \u2265 65 years) with blunt splenic injury (BSI) have up to a 6% failure rate of non-operative management (NOM). GTPs failing NOM have a similar mortality rate compared to GTPs managed successfully with NOM. However, it is unclear if this remains true in octogenarians (aged 80\u201389 years). We hypothesized that the failure rate for NOM in octogenarians would be similar to their younger geriatric cohort, patients aged 65\u201379 years; however risk of mortality in octogenarians who fail NOM would be higher than that of octogenarians managed successfully with NOM. The Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2010\u20132016) was queried for patients with BSI. Those undergoing splenectomy within 6 h were excluded to select for patients undergoing NOM. Patients aged 65\u201379 years (young GTPs) were compared to octogenarians. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to determine the risk for failed NOM and mortality. From 43,041 BSI patients undergoing NOM, 3660 (8.5%) were aged 65\u201379 years and 1236 (2.9%) were octogenarians. Both groups had a similar median Injury Severity Score (ISS) (p = 0.10) and failure rate of NOM (6.6% young GTPs vs. 6.8% octogenarians p = 0.82). From those failing NOM, octogenarians had similar units of blood products transfused (p > 0.05) and a higher mortality rate (40.5% vs. 18.2%, p < 0.001), compared to young GTPs. Independent risk factors for failing NOM in octogenarians included \u2265 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) (p = 0.039) within 24 h of admission. Octogenarians who failed NOM had a higher mortality rate compared to octogenarians managed successfully with NOM (40.5% vs 23.6% p = 0.001), which persisted in a multivariable logistic regression analysis (OR 2.25, CI 1.37\u20133.70, p < 0.001). Late failure of NOM \u2265 24 h (vs. early failure) was not associated with increased risk of mortality (p = 0.88), but \u2265 1 unit of PRBC transfused had higher risk (OR 1.88, CI 1.20\u20132.95, p = 0.006). Compared to young GTPs with BSI, octogenarians have a similar rate of failed NOM. Octogenarians with BSI who fail NOM have over a twofold higher risk of mortality compared to those managed successfully with NOM. PRBC transfusion increases risk for mortality. Therefore, clinicians should consider failure of NOM earlier in the octogenarian population to mitigate the risk of increased mortality.",

We investigated the effect of intubation in trauma patients with a GCS 6\u20138, with the hypothesis that intubation would increase mortality and length of stay. METHODS: We studied adult patients with GCS 6\u20138 from the 2016 National Trauma Data Bank. Intubated and non-intubated patients were compared using inverse probability weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) to control for injury severity and patient characteristics. Outcomes were mortality, intensive care unit length of stay (ICU LOS), and total LOS. Stratified analysis was performed to investigate the effect in patients with and without head injuries. RESULTS: Among 6676 patients with a GCS between 6 and 84,078 were intubated within 1 h of arrival to the emergency department. The overall mortality rate was 15.1%. IPWRA revealed an increase in mortality associated with intubation (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03, 1.06). The results were similar in patients with head injuries (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02, 1.06) and without (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03, 1.10). Among the 5,742 patients admitted to the ICU, intubation was associated with a 14% increase in ICU LOS (95% CI 8\u201320%; 5.5 vs. 4.8 days; p < 0.001). The overall length of stay was 27% longer (95% CI 19.8\u201334.3%) among intubated patients (mean 7.7 vs 6.0 days; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Among patients with GCS of 6 to 8, intubation on arrival was associated with an increase in mortality and with longer ICU and overall length of stay. The use of a strict threshold GCS to mandate intubation should be revisited.",

The amount of phlegm suctioned correlated positively with the length of the vertical path of motion of the wrist and forearm, and with the angular velocity of thumb rotation in both the groups.

The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term outcome in survivors after open surgery for rAAA in well-defined population. METHODS: This is a population-based, observational long-term follow-up (beyond 30-day mortality) study of patients surgically treated for rAAA from 2000 through 2014. Long-term survival was analysed using Kaplan\u2013Meier estimates and compared to the general population by analyses of relative survival. RESULTS: Out of 178 patients operated for rAAA, 95 patients (55%) either died in the perioperative period, were referred from other hospitals or were lost to follow-up (two patients). Altogether 83 patients were eligible for long-term outcomes: 72 men and 11 women. Estimated median crude survival time was 6.5 years [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.8\u20138.2]. Men had a median survival of 7.3 years (95% CI 5.1\u20139.4) versus 5.4 years in females (95% CI 3.5\u20137.3) (P = 0.082). Reinterventions during follow-up occurred in 31 (37%). Relative survival demonstrated a slightly higher risk of death in the rAAA population compared to the general age- and gender-matched population. Age, but not comorbidities, had a significant influence on long-term survival. CONCLUSION: For survivors beyond 30 days after surgery for rAAA, long-term survival compares well to that of an age- and sex-matched population. A high frequency of cardiovascular comorbidities did not seem to affect long-term survival.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the benefit-to-risk balance of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHODS: In 16 ICUs, we prospectively collected adverse events during or within 24 h after BAL and assessed the BAL input for decision making in consecutive adult patients. The occurrence of a clinical adverse event at least of grade 3, i.e., sufficiently severe to need therapeutic action(s), including modification(s) in respiratory support, defined poor BAL tolerance. The BAL input for decision making was declared satisfactory if it allowed to interrupt or initiate one or several treatments. RESULTS: We included 483 BAL in 483 patients [age 63 years (interquartile range (IQR) 53\u201372); female gender: 162 (33.5%); simplified acute physiology score II: 48 (IQR 37-61); immunosuppression 244 (50.5%)]. BAL was begun in non-intubated patients in 105 (21.7%) cases. Sixty-seven (13.9%) patients reached the grade 3 of adverse event or higher. Logistic regression showed that a BAL performed by a non-experienced physician (non-pulmonologist, or intensivist with less than 10 years in the specialty or less than 50 BAL performed) was the main predictor of poor BAL tolerance in non-intubated patients [OR: 3.57 (95% confidence interval 1.04\u201312.35); P = 0.04]. A satisfactory BAL input for decision making was observed in 227 (47.0%) cases and was not predictable using logistic regression. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse events related to BAL in ICU patients are not infrequent nor necessarily benign. Our findings call for an extreme caution, when envisaging a BAL in ICU patients and for a mandatory accompaniment of the less experienced physicians.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence of spine injury on MRI in children evaluated for AHT, and to correlate spine MRI findings with clinical characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified children younger than 5 years who were evaluated for AHT with spine MRI. Abuse likelihood was determined a priori by expert consensus. We blindly reviewed spine MRIs and compared spinal injury, abuse likelihood, patient demographics, severity of brain injury, presence of retinal hemorrhages, and pattern of head injury between children with and without spine injury. RESULTS: Forty-five of 76 (59.2%) children had spine injury. Spine injury was associated with more severe injury (longer intensive care stays [P<0.001], lower initial mental status [P=0.01] and longer ventilation times [P=0.001]). Overall abuse likelihood and spine injury were not associated. Spinal subdural hemorrhage was the only finding associated with a combination of retinal hemorrhages (P=0.01), noncontact head injuries (P=0.008) and a diagnosis of AHT (P<0.05). Spinal subdural hemorrhage was associated with other spine injury (P=0.004) but not with intracranial hemorrhage (P=0.28). CONCLUSION: Spinal injury is seen in most children evaluated for AHT and might be clinically and forensically valuable. Spinal subdural hemorrhage might support a mechanism of severe acceleration\/deceleration head injury and a diagnosis of AHT.",

        "abstract": "Pneumonectomy after traumatic lung injury (TLI) is associated with shock, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and eventual right ventricular failure. Historically, trauma pneumonectomy (TP) mortality rates ranged between 53 and 100%. It is unclear if contemporary mortality rates have improved. Therefore, we evaluated outcomes associated with TP and limited lung resections (LLR) (i.e., lobectomy and segmentectomy) and aimed to identify predictors of mortality, hypothesizing that TP is associated with greater mortality versus LLR. We queried the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2010\u20132016) and performed a multivariable logistic regression to determine the independent predictors of mortality in TLI patients undergoing TP versus LLR. TLI occurred in 287,276 patients. Of these, 889 required lung resection with 758 (85.3%) undergoing LLR and 131 (14.7%) undergoing TP. Patients undergoing TP had a higher median injury severity score (26.0 vs. 24.5, p = 0.03) but no difference in initial median systolic blood pressure (109 vs. 107 mmHg, p = 0.92) compared to LLR. Mortality was significantly higher for TP compared to LLR (64.9% vs 27.2%, p < 0.001). The strongest independent predictor for mortality was undergoing TP versus LLR (OR 4.89, CI 3.18\u20137.54, p < 0.001). TP continues to be associated with a higher mortality compared to LLR. Furthermore, TP is independently associated with a fivefold increased risk of mortality compared to LLR. Future investigations should focus on identifying parameters or treatment modalities that improve survivability after TP. We recommend that surgeons reserve TP as a last-resort management given the continued high morbidity and mortality associated with this procedure.",

Outcomes of the most recent epoch were compared to contemporaneous benchmarks from Vermont Oxford Network (VON). RESULTS: Of 773 infants (median GA = 28 weeks, average BW = 995 g), 24.5% were intubated in DR and 11.7% in the first day of life. Mechanical ventilation, bCPAP and oxygen days in survivors were 1.5, 29 and 14, respectively. Overall incidence of CLD was 6.4% that remained consistent in the four epochs (7.6%, 7.5%, 5.8% and 5%), respectively. In comparison to VON, CLD was significantly less (p < 0.001).

METHODS: This retrospective observational study was performed in an 11-bed, level 3 pediatric intensive care unit. Evaluation was made of 30 pediatric patients receiving airway pressure release ventilation as rescue therapy for severe ARDS. RESULTS: Patients were switched to APRV on an average 3.2 \u00b1 2.6 d following intubation. When changed from conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) to APRV, there was an expected increase in the SpO(2)\/FiO(2) ratio (165.1 \u00b1 13.6 vs. 131.7 \u00b1 10.2; p = 0.035). Mean peak inspiratory pressure was significantly lower during APRV (25.4 \u00b1 1.26 vs. 29.8 \u00b1 0.60, p < 0.001) compared to CMV prior to APRV but mean airway pressure (P(aw)) was significantly higher during APRV (19.1 \u00b1 0.9 vs. 15.3 \u00b1 1.3, p < 0.001). Hospital mortality in this study group was 16.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support the hypothesis that APRV may offer potential clinical advantages for ventilatory management and may be considered as an alternative rescue mechanical ventilation mode in pediatric ARDS patients refractory to conventional ventilation.",

Our aim was to compare more recent measures, i.e. FOUR score and automated pupillometry, to standard monitoring with the GCS and visual inspection of pupils. METHODS: Supervised trained nursing staff examined a consecutive sample of patients admitted to the neuro-ICU of a tertiary referral centre using GCS and FOUR score and assessing pupillary function first by visual inspection and then by automated pupillometry. Clinical outcome was evaluated 6 months after admission using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended. RESULTS: Fifty-six consecutive patients (median age 63 years) were assessed a total of 234 times. Of the 36 patients with at least one GCS score of 3, 13 had a favourable outcome. All seven patients with at least one FOUR score of \u2264 3 had an unfavourable outcome, which was best predicted by a low \u201cbrainstem\u201d sub-score. Compared to automated pupillometry, visual assessment underestimated pupillary diameters (median difference, 0.4 mm; P = 0.006). Automated pupillometry detected a preserved pupillary light reflex in 10 patients, in whom visual inspection had missed pupillary constriction. DISCUSSION: Training of nursing staff to implement frequent monitoring of patients in the neuro-ICU with FOUR score and automated pupillometry is feasible. Both measures provide additional clinical information compared to the GCS and visual assessment of pupillary function, most importantly a more granular classification of patients with low levels of consciousness by the FOUR score.",

This study aims to describe the patients\u2019 characteristics, timing, and factors related to the decision to perform a tracheostomy and differences in strategies among different countries and assess the effect of the timing of tracheostomy on patients\u2019 outcomes. METHODS: We selected TBI patients from CENTER-TBI, a prospective observational longitudinal cohort study, with an intensive care unit stay \u2265 72 h. Tracheostomy was defined as early (\u2264 7 days from admission) or late (> 7 days). We used a Cox regression model to identify critical factors that affected the timing of tracheostomy. The outcome was assessed at 6 months using the extended Glasgow Outcome Score. RESULTS: Of the 1358 included patients, 433 (31.8%) had a tracheostomy. Age (hazard rate, HR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.01\u20131.07, p = 0.003), Glasgow coma scale \u2264 8 (HR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.22\u20132.36 at 7; p < 0.001), thoracic trauma (HR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.01\u20131.52, p = 0.020), hypoxemia (HR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.05\u20131.79, p = 0.048), unreactive pupil (HR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.27\u20132.45 at 7; p < 0.001) were predictors for tracheostomy. Considerable heterogeneity among countries was found in tracheostomy frequency (7.9\u201350.2%) and timing (early 0\u201317.6%). Patients with a late tracheostomy were more likely to have a worse neurological outcome, i.e., mortality and poor neurological sequels (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.07\u20132.67, p = 0.018), and longer length of stay (LOS) (38.5 vs. 49.4 days, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Tracheostomy after TBI is routinely performed in severe neurological damaged patients. Early tracheostomy is associated with a better neurological outcome and reduced LOS, but the causality of this relationship remains unproven.

This was a prospective cohort study of pediatric patients diagnosed with congenital heart disease who underwent heart surgery and used NIV. Data were collected from 170 patients with a median age of 2 months. No patient presented cardiorespiratory arrest nor any other complication during the use of NIV. The success rate for the use of NIV was 61.8%. Subjects were divided for analysis into successful and failed NIV groups. Statistical analysis used Chi-square, Mann\u2013Whitney, and Student\u2019s t tests, which were performed after univariate and multivariate logistic regression for p < 0.05. In the multivariate analysis, only the minimal pressure gradient (OR 1.45 with p = 0.007), maximum oxygen saturation (OR 0.88 with p = 0.011), and maximum fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) (OR 1.16 with p < 0.001) influenced NIV failure. The following variables did not present a statistical difference: extracorporeal circulation time (p = 0.669), pulmonary hypertension (p = 0.254), genetic syndrome (p = 0.342), RACHS-1 score (p = 0.097), age (p = 0.098), invasive mechanical ventilation duration (p = 0.186), and NIV duration (p = 0.804). In conclusion, NIV can be successfully used in children who, after cardiac surgery, develop respiratory failure in the 48 h following extubation. Although the use of higher pressure gradients and higher FiO(2) are associated with a greater failure rate for NIV use, it was found to be generally safe.",

However, Pmus is not commonly measured since an esophageal balloon catheter is required. We have previously shown that Pmus can be estimated by measuring the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) through the Pmus\/EAdi index (PEI). We investigated whether PEI could be reliably measured by a brief end-expiratory occlusion maneuver to propose an automated PEI measurement performed by the ventilator. Pmus, EAdi, airway pressure (Paw), and flow waveforms of 12 critically ill patients undergoing assisted mechanical ventilation were recorded. Repeated end-expiratory occlusion maneuvers were performed. PEI was measured at 100 ms (PEI(0.1)) and 200 ms (PEI(0.2)) from the start of the occlusion and compared to the PEI measured at the maximum Paw deflection (PEI(occl), reference). PEI(0.1) and PEI(0.2) tightly correlated with PEI(occl), (p < 0.001, R(2) = 0.843 and 0.847). At a patient-level analysis, the highest percentage error was -64% and 50% for PEI(0.1) and PEI(0.2), respectively, suggesting that PEI(0.2) might be a more reliable measurement. After correcting the error bias, the PEI(0.2) percentage error was lower than \u00b1 30% in all but one subjects (range \u2212 39 to + 29%). It is possible to calculate PEI over a brief airway occlusion of 200 ms at inspiratory onset without the need for a full patient's inspiratory effort. Automated and repeated brief airway occlusions performed by the ventilator can provide a real time measurement of PEI; combining the automatically measured PEI with the EAdi trace could be used to continuously display the Pmus waveform at the bedside without the need of an esophageal balloon catheter.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preoperative assessment of geriatric-specific determinants of health may enhance perioperative risk stratification among elderly patients. This study examines effects of geriatric-specific variables on postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing elective major abdominal operations. METHODS: Patients included in the ACS NSQIP pilot Geriatric Surgery Research File program who underwent elective pancreatic, liver, and colorectal operations between 2014 and 2016 were examined. Multivariable analyses were performed to evaluate associations between patient-specific geriatric variables and risk of death, morbidity, readmission, and discharge destination. RESULTS: A total of 4165 patients were included. Patients \u226585 years were more likely to die, experience postoperative morbidity, and be discharged to a facility (all p \u2264 0.039) than younger patients. Preoperatively, patients \u226585 years were more likely to use a mobility aid, have a prior fall, have consent signed by a surrogate, and to live alone at home prior to operation (all p < 0.001). After adjustment for ACS NSQIP-estimated probabilities of morbidity or mortality, no geriatric-specific preoperative risk factors were significantly associated with increased risk of death or complications in any age group (all p > 0.055). Patients 75\u201384 and \u226585 years were more likely to be discharged to facility (OR 2.33 and 4.75, respectively, both p < 0.001) compared to patients 65\u201374 years. All geriatric-specific variables: use of mobility aid, living alone, consent signed by a surrogate, and fall history, were significantly associated with discharge to a facility (all p \u2264 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for comorbid conditions, geriatric-specific variables are not associated with postoperative mortality and morbidity among elderly patients; however, geriatric-specific variables are significantly associated with discharge to a facility.",

For concurrent treatment of two trauma patients, two carbon CT examination and intervention tables are positioned head to head with one sliding CT-Gantry in the middle. The focus of this study is the process of trauma care with the time to CT (tCT) and the time to operation (tOR) as quality indicator. METHODS: All patients with suspected multiple trauma, who required emergency surgery and who were initially diagnosed by the CT trauma protocol between 05\/2018 and 12\/2018 were included. Data relating to time spans (tCT and tOR), severity of injury and outcome was obtained. RESULTS: 110 of the 589 screened trauma patients had surgery immediately after finishing primary assessment in the ER. The ISS was 17 (9\u201334) (median and interquartile range, IQR). tCT was 15 (11\u201319) minutes (median and IQR) and tOR was 96.5 (75\u2013119) minutes (median and IQR). In the first 30 days, seven patients died (6.4%) including two within the first 24 h (2%). There were two ICU days (1\u20136) (median and IQR) and one (0\u20131) (median and IQR) ventilator day.

RESULTS: Twenty-four infants with mean gestational age 25.0 weeks and 743 g birth weight requiring mechanical ventilation were enrolled at mean age 6 days. Budesonide was detected in the blood of all infants with a half-life of 3.4 h. Of 11 infants with elevated TA cytokine levels at baseline, treatment was associated with sustained decrease (mean 65%) at all three dosing levels. There were time- and dose-dependent decreases in blood cortisol concentrations and changes in total blood metabolites. Respiratory outcomes did not differ from the historic controls.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the US, and COPD exacerbations result in approximately 700,000 hospitalizations annually. Patients with acute respiratory failure due to severe COPD exacerbation are treated with invasive (IMV) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV). Although IMV reverses hypercapnia\/hypoxia, it causes significant morbidity and mortality. There is strong evidence that patients treated with NIV have better outcomes, and NIV is recommended as first line therapy in these patients. Yet, several studies have demonstrated substantial variation in the use of NIV across hospitals, leading to preventable morbidity and mortality. Through a series of mixed-methods studies, we have found that successful implementation of NIV requires physicians, respiratory therapists (RTs), and nurses to communicate and collaborate effectively, suggesting that efforts to increase the use of NIV in COPD need to account for the complex and interdisciplinary nature of NIV delivery and the need for team coordination. Therefore, we propose to compare two educational strategies: online education (OLE) and interprofessional education (IPE) which targets complex team-based care in NIV delivery. METHODS AND DESIGN: Twenty hospitals with low baseline rates of NIV use will be randomized to either the OLE or IPE study arm. The primary outcome of the trial is change in the hospital rate of NIV use among patients with COPD requiring ventilatory support. In aim 1, we will compare the uptake change over time of NIV use among patients with COPD in hospitals enrolled in the two arms. In aim 2, we will explore mediators\u2019 role (respiratory therapist autonomy and team functionality) on the relationship between the implementation strategies and implementation effectiveness. Finally, in aim 3, through interviews with providers, we will assess acceptability and feasibility of the educational training. DISCUSSIONS: This study will be among the first to carefully test the impact of IPE in the inpatient setting. This work promises to change practice by offering approaches to facilitate greater uptake of NIV and may generalize to other interventions directed to seriously-ill patients.

        "abstract": "Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) has never been applied in patients recovering from acute brain injury (ABI) because neural respiratory drive could be affected by intracranial disease with detrimental effects on cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity. Our primary aim was to assess the impact of NAVA and pressure support ventilation (PSV) on CBF velocity. In fifteen adult patients recovering from ABI and undergoing invasive assisted ventilation, PSV and NAVA were applied over 30-min-lasting trials, in the following sequence: PSV(1), NAVA, and PSV(2). While PSV was set to deliver a tidal volume ranging between 6 and 8 ml kg(\u22121) of predicted body weight, in NAVA the level of assistance was chosen to achieve the same inspiratory peak airway pressure as PSV. At the end of each trial, a sonographic evaluation of CBF mean velocity was bilaterally obtained on the middle cerebral artery and an arterial blood gas sample was taken for analysis. CBF mean velocity was 51.8 [41.9,75.2] cm s(\u22121) at baseline, 51.9 [43.4,71.0] cm s(\u22121) in PSV(1), 53.6 [40.7,67.7] cm s(\u22121) in NAVA, and 49.5 [42.1,70.8] cm s(\u22121) in PSV(2) (p = 0.0514) on the left and 50.2 [38.0,77.7] cm s(\u22121) at baseline, 47.8 [41.7,68.2] cm s(\u22121) in PSV(1), 53.9 [40.1,78.5] cm s(\u22121) in NAVA, and 55.6 [35.9,74.1] cm s(\u22121) in PSV(2) (p = 0.8240) on the right side.

The main outcome was the CLABSI density rate per 1000 days. Secondary outcomes included CLABSI episodes, CLABSI episodes per infant, and CLABSI\/death. A multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to assess whether the type of catheter (ECC vs. BCV) was associated with CLABSI risk. Ninety-six catheters (21 BCVs and 75 ECCs) in 79 infants were included (993 catheter days). BCV catheters were associated with a reduced CLABSI density rate compared to ECCs (3.05\/1000 days vs 21.1\/1000 days; p < 0.001).

To aid clinicians in consistently selecting lung- and diaphragm-protective ventilation settings, a physiology-based decision support system is needed. To form the foundation of such a system, a comprehensive physiological model which captures the dynamics of ventilation has been developed. The Lung and Diaphragm Protective Ventilation (LDPV) model centers around respiratory drive and incorporates respiratory system mechanics, ventilator mechanics, and blood acid\u2013base balance. The model uses patient-specific parameters as inputs and outputs predictions of a patient\u2019s transpulmonary and esophageal driving pressures (outputs most clinically relevant to lung and diaphragm safety), as well as their blood pH, under various ventilator and sedation conditions. Model simulations and global optimization techniques were used to evaluate and characterize the model. The LDPV model is demonstrated to describe a CO(2) respiratory response that is comparable to what is found in literature. Sensitivity analysis of the model indicate that the ventilator and sedation settings incorporated in the model have a significant impact on the target output parameters. Finally, the model is seen to be able to provide robust predictions of esophageal pressure, transpulmonary pressure and blood pH for patient parameters with realistic variability. The LDPV model is a robust physiological model which produces outputs which directly target and reflect the risk of ventilator-induced lung and diaphragm injury. Ventilation and sedation parameters are seen to modulate the model outputs in accordance with what is currently known in literature.

Weaning failure was defined as failed SBT or reintubation within 48 h of extubation. PPI readings were obtained before initiation of the SBT, and every 5 min till the end of the SBT. PPI ratio was calculated at every time point as: PPI value\/ baseline PPI. The primary outcome was the accuracy of PPI ratio at the end of the SBT in detecting failed weaning. Forty-three patients were available for the final analysis. Eighteen patients (42%) were considered failed weaning. PPI ratio was higher in patients with successful weaning compared to patients with failed weaning during the last 15 min of the SBT. PPI ratio at the end of SBT was higher in patients with successful weaning compared to patients with failed weaning. PPI ratio at the end of SBT had good predictive ability for weaning failure {area under receiver operating characteristic curve (95% confidence interval): 0.833(0.688\u20130.929), cutoff value \u2264 1.41}. The change in PPI during SBT is an independent predictor for re-intubation. PPI could be a useful tool for monitoring the patient response to SBT. Patients with successful weaning showed higher augmentation of PPI during the SBT compared to re-intubated patients. Failure of augmenting the PPI by 41% at the end of SBT could predict re-intubation with negative predictive value of 95%.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Previous studies assessing impact of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on mortality have shown conflicting results. We sought to assess the independent association of ARDS with in-hospital mortality among intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis. METHODS: We studied two prospective sepsis cohorts drawn from the Early Assessment of Renal and Lung Injury (EARLI; n = 474) and Validating Acute Lung Injury markers for Diagnosis (VALID; n = 337) cohorts. ARDS was defined by Berlin criteria. We used logistic regression to compare in-hospital mortality in patients with and without ARDS, controlling for baseline severity of illness. We also estimated attributable mortality, adjusted for illness severity by stratification. RESULTS: ARDS occurred in 195 EARLI patients (41%) and 99 VALID patients (29%). ARDS was independently associated with risk of hospital death in multivariate analysis, even after controlling for severity of illness, as measured by APACHE II (odds ratio [OR] 1.65 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02, 2.67), p = 0.04 in EARLI; OR 2.12 (CI 1.16, 3.92), p = 0.02 in VALID). Patients with severe ARDS (P\/F < 100) primarily drove this relationship. The attributable mortality of ARDS was 27% (CI 14%, 37%) in EARLI and 37% (CI 10%, 51%) in VALID. ARDS was independently associated with ICU mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, and ventilator-free days. CONCLUSIONS: Development of ARDS among ICU patients with sepsis confers increased risk of ICU and in-hospital mortality in addition to other important outcomes. Clinical trials targeting patients with severe ARDS will be best poised to detect measurable differences in these outcomes.

The alveolar \u201crecruitment\u201d maneuver (RM) keeps airway pressure high, opening alveoli, and increasing arterial oxygenation. The aim of our study is to research the effect on respiratory mechanics and arterial blood gases of performing the RM in LSG surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty patients undergoing LSG surgery were divided into two groups (n = 30) Patients in group R had the RM performed 5 min after desufflation with 100% oxygen, 40 cmH(2)O pressure for 40 s. Group C had standard mechanical ventilation. Assessments of respiratory mechanics and arterial blood gases were made in the 10th min after induction (T1), 10th min after insufflation (T2), 5th min after desufflation (T3), and 15th min after desufflation (T4). Arterial blood gases were assessed in the 30th min (T5) in the postoperative recovery unit. RESULTS: In group R, values at T5, PaO(2) were significantly high, while PaCO(2) were significantly low compared with group C. Compliance in both groups reduced with pneumoperitoneum. At T4, the compliance in the recruitment group was higher. In both groups, there was an increase in PIP with pneumoperitoneum and after desufflation this was identified to reduce to levels before pneumoperitoneum. CONCLUSION: Adding the RM to PEEP administration for morbidly obese patients undergoing LSG surgery is considered to be effective in improving respiratory mechanics and arterial blood gas values and can be used safely.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Lung mechanics measurements provide clinically useful information about disease progression and lung health. Currently, there are no commonly practiced methods to non-invasively measure both resistive and elastic lung mechanics during tidal breathing, preventing the important information provided by lung mechanics from being utilised. This study presents a novel method to easily assess lung mechanics of spontaneously breathing subjects using a dynamic elastance, single-compartment lung model. METHODS: A spirometer with a built-in shutter was used to occlude expiration during tidal breathing, creating exponentially decaying flow when the shutter re-opened. The lung mechanics measured were respiratory system elastance and resistance, separated from the exponentially decaying flow, and interrupter resistance calculated at shutter closure. Progressively increasing resistance was added to the spirometer mouthpiece to simulate upper airway obstruction. The lung mechanics of 17 healthy subjects were successfully measured through spirometry. RESULTS: N = 17 (8 female, 9 male) healthy subjects were recruited. Measured decay rates ranged from 5 to 42\/s, subjects with large variation of decay rates showed higher muscular breathing effort. Lung elastance measurements ranged from 3.9 to 21.2 cmH[Formula: see text] O\/L, with no clear trend between change in elastance and added resistance. Resistance calculated from decay rate and elastance ranged from 0.15 to 1.95 cmH[Formula: see text] Os\/L. These very small resistance values are due to the airflow measured originating from low-resistance areas in the centre of airways. Occlusion resistance measurements were as expected for healthy subjects, and increased as expected as resistance was added. CONCLUSIONS: This test was able to identify reasonable dynamic lung elastance and occlusion resistance values, providing new insight into expiratory breathing effort. Clinically, this lung function test could impact current practice. It does not require high levels of cooperation from the subject, allowing a wider cohort of patients to be assessed more easily. Additionally, this test can be simply implemented in a small standalone device, or with standard lung function testing equipment.",

        "doi": "10.1007\/s12028-020-00969-5",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Limiting tidal volume (V(T)), plateau pressure, and driving pressure is essential during the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but may be challenging when brain injury coexists due to the risk of hypercapnia. Because lowering dead space enhances CO(2) clearance, we conducted a study to determine whether and to what extent replacing heat and moisture exchangers (HME) with heated humidifiers (HH) facilitate safe V(T) lowering in brain-injured patients with ARDS. METHODS: Brain-injured patients (head trauma or spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage with Glasgow Coma Scale at admission < 9) with mild and moderate ARDS received three ventilatory strategies in a sequential order during continuous paralysis: (1) HME with V(T) to obtain a PaCO(2) within 30\u201335 mmHg (HME1); (2) HH with V(T) titrated to obtain the same PaCO(2) (HH); and (3) HME1 settings resumed (HME2). Arterial blood gases, static and quasi-static respiratory mechanics, alveolar recruitment by multiple pressure\u2013volume curves, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, mean arterial pressure, and mean flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery by transcranial Doppler were recorded. Dead space was measured and partitioned by volumetric capnography. RESULTS: Eighteen brain-injured patients were studied: 7 (39%) had mild and 11 (61%) had moderate ARDS. At inclusion, median [interquartile range] PaO(2)\/FiO(2) was 173 [146\u2013213] and median PEEP was 8 cmH(2)O [5\u20139]. HH allowed to reduce V(T) by 120 ml [95% CI: 98\u2013144], V(T)\/kg predicted body weight by 1.8 ml\/kg [95% CI: 1.5\u20132.1], plateau pressure and driving pressure by 3.7 cmH(2)O [2.9\u20134.3], without affecting PaCO(2), alveolar recruitment, and oxygenation. This was permitted by lower airway (\u2212 84 ml [95% CI: \u2212 79 to \u2212 89]) and total dead space (\u2212 86 ml [95% CI: \u2212 73 to \u2212 98]). Sixteen patients (89%) showed driving pressure equal or lower than 14 cmH(2)O while on HH, as compared to 7 (39%) and 8 (44%) during HME1 and HME2 (p < 0.001). No changes in mean arterial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, intracranial pressure, and middle cerebral artery mean flow velocity were documented during HH. CONCLUSION: The dead space reduction provided by HH allows to safely reduce V(T) without modifying PaCO(2) nor cerebral perfusion. This permits to provide a wider proportion of brain-injured ARDS patients with less injurious ventilation.",

RCTs have shown preventive impact of avoiding hyperglycemia, of omitting early parenteral nutrition use and of minimizing sedation. Results of studies investigating the impact of early mobilization, neuromuscular electrical stimulation and of pharmacological interventions were inconsistent, with recent systematic reviews\/meta-analyses revealing no or only low-quality evidence for benefit.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The clinical effectiveness of neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) has yet to be demonstrated, and preliminary studies are required. The study aim was to assess the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of NAVA versus pressure support ventilation (PSV) in critically ill adults at risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation (MV). METHODS: An open-label, parallel, feasibility RCT (n = 78) in four ICUs of one university-affiliated hospital. The primary outcome was mode adherence (percentage of time adherent to assigned mode), and protocol compliance (binary\u2014\u2265 65% mode adherence). Secondary exploratory outcomes included ventilator-free days (VFDs), sedation, and mortality. RESULTS: In the 72 participants who commenced weaning, median (95% CI) mode adherence was 83.1% (64.0\u201397.1%) and 100% (100\u2013100%), and protocol compliance was 66.7% (50.3\u201380.0%) and 100% (89.0\u2013100.0%) in the NAVA and PSV groups respectively. Secondary outcomes indicated more VFDs to D28 (median difference 3.0 days, 95% CI 0.0\u201311.0; p = 0.04) and fewer in-hospital deaths (relative risk 0.5, 95% CI 0.2\u20130.9; p = 0.032) for NAVA. Although overall sedation was similar, Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) scores were closer to zero in NAVA compared to PSV (p = 0.020). No significant differences were observed in duration of MV, ICU or hospital stay, or ICU, D28, and D90 mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility trial demonstrated good adherence to assigned ventilation mode and the ability to meet a priori protocol compliance criteria. Exploratory outcomes suggest some clinical benefit for NAVA compared to PSV. Clinical effectiveness trials of NAVA are potentially feasible and warranted.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to investigate the incidence and risk factors of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in patients undergoing emergency surgery for type A acute aortic dissection (TA-AAD) and evaluate the perioperative and long-term outcomes. METHODS: From January 2014 to December 2018, 712 consecutive patients were enrolled in the study. These patients were divided into two groups according to whether or not needed postoperative CRRT: the CRRT group vs the control group. Univariate analysis and binary logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the risk factors of CRRT. To avoid the selection bias and confounders, baseline characteristics were matched for propensity scores. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to provide survival estimates at postoperative points in time. RESULTS: Before propensity score matching, univariate analysis showed that there were significant differences in age, preoperative hypertension, pericardial effusion, preoperative serum creatinine (sCr), intraoperative need for combined coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or mitral valve or tricuspid valve surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time, extracorporeal circulation assistant time, aortic cross-clamp time, drainage volume 24 h after surgery and ventilator time between two groups. All were higher in the CRRT group (P < 0.05). These risk factors were included in binary logistic regression. It showed that preoperative sCr and CPB time were independent risk factors for CRRT patients undergoing surgery for TA-AAD. And there were significant differences regarding 30-day mortality (P < 0.001) and long-term overall cumulative survival (P < 0.001) with up to a 6-year follow-up. After propensity scoring, 29 pairs (58 patients) were successfully matched. Among these patients, the analysis showed that CPB time was still significantly longer in the CRRT group (P = 0.004), and the 30-day mortality rate was also higher in this group (44.8% vs 10.3%; P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: CRRT after TA-AAD is common and worsened short- and long- term mortality. The preoperative sCr and CPB time are independent risk factors for postoperative CRRT patients. Shorten the CPB time as much as possible is recommended to reduce the risk of CRRT after the operation.",

Failure-to-rescue (FTR) is defined as death after a surgical complication, which is an institution-level surgical safety and quality metric that is an important variable affecting mortality rates in hospitals. This study aims to examine whether complication and FTR are different across low- and high-mortality hospitals for trauma care. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study performed at trauma care hospitals registered at Japan Trauma Data Bank (JTDB) from 2004 to 2017. Trauma patients aged \u2265 15 years with injury severity score (ISS) of \u2265 3 and those who survived for > 48 h after hospital admission were included. The hospitals in JTDB were categorized into three groups by standardized mortality rate. We compared trauma complications, FTR, and in-hospital mortality by a standardized mortality rate (divided by the institute-level quartile). RESULTS: Among 184,214 patients that were enrolled, the rate of any complication was 12.7%. The overall mortality rate was 3.7%, and the mortality rate among trauma patients without complications was only 2.8% (non-precedented deaths). However, the mortality rate among trauma patients with any complications was 10.2% (FTR). Hospitals were categorized into high- (40 facilities with 44,773 patients), average- (72 facilities with 102,368 patients), and low- (39 facilities with 37,073 patients) mortality hospitals, using the hospital ranking of a standardized mortality rate. High-mortality hospitals showed lower ISS than low-mortality hospitals [10 (IQR, 9\u201318) vs. 11 (IQR, 9\u201320), P < 0.01]. Patients in high-mortality hospitals showed more complications (14.2% vs. 11.2%, P < 0.01), in-hospital mortality (5.1% vs. 2.5%, P < 0.01), FTR (13.6% vs. 7.4%, P < 0.01), and non-precedented deaths (3.6% vs. 1.9%, P < 0.01) than those in low-mortality hospitals.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\u2014AIM: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) can occur concomitantly and be associated with coagulopathy that influences TBI outcome. The use of bleeding time tests in TBI management is controversial. We hypothesized that in TBI patients with AUD, a prolonged bleeding time is associated with more severe injury and poor outcome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Moderate and severe TBI patients with evidence of AUD were examined with bleeding time according to IVY bleeding time on admission during neurointensive care. Baseline clinical and radiological characteristics were recorded. A standardized IVY bleeding time test was determined by staff trained in the procedure. Bleeding time test results were divided into normal (\u2264 600 s), prolonged (> 600 s), and markedly prolonged (\u2265 900 s). Normal platelet count (PLT) was defined as > 150,000\/\u03bcL. This cohort was compared with another group of TBI patients without evidence of AUD. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients with TBI and AUD were identified, and 121 TBI patients without any history of AUD were used as controls. PLT was low in 44.2% and bleeding time was prolonged in 69.2% of patients. Bleeding time values negatively correlated with PLT (p < 0.05). TBI patients with markedly prolonged values (\u2265 900 s) had significantly increased hematoma size, and more frequently required intracranial pressure measurement and mechanical ventilation compared with those with bleeding times < 900 s (p < 0.05). Most patients (88%) with low platelet count had prolonged bleeding time. No difference in 6-month outcome between the bleeding time groups was observed (p > 0.05). Subjects with TBI and no evidence for AUD had lower bleeding time values and higher platelet count compared with those with TBI and history of AUD (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although differences in the bleeding time values between TBI cohorts exist and prolonged values may be seen even in patients with normal platelet count, the bleeding test is a marker of primary hemostasis and platelet function with low specificity. However, it may provide an additional assessment in the interpretation of the overall status of TBI patients with AUD. Therefore, the bleeding time test should only be used in combination with the patient\u2019s bleeding history and careful assessment of other hematologic parameters.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Supervised cardio-pulmonary rehabilitation may be safe and beneficial for people with pulmonary hypertension (PH) in groups 1 (pulmonary arterial hypertension) and 4 (chronic thromboembolic disease), particularly as a hospital in-patient. It has not been tested in the most common PH groups; 2 (left heart disease), 3 (lung disease), or 5 (other disorders). Further it has not been evaluated in the UK National Health Service (NHS) out-patient setting, or with long-term follow-up. The aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to test the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a supervised exercise rehabilitation intervention with psychosocial support compared to best practice usual care for people with PH in the community\/outpatient setting. METHODS: This multi-centre, pragmatic, two-arm RCT with embedded process evaluation aims to recruit 352 clinically stable adults with PH (groups 1\u20135) and WHO functional class II-IV. Participants will be randomised to either the Supervised Pulmonary Hypertension Exercise Rehabilitation (SPHERe) intervention or control. The SPHERe intervention consists of 1) individual assessment and familiarisation sessions; 2) 8-week, twice-weekly, supervised out-patient exercise training; 3) psychosocial\/motivational support and education; 4) guided home exercise plan. The control intervention consists of best practice usual care with a single one-to-one practitioner appointment, and general advice on physical activity. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 4 months (post-intervention) and 12 months by researchers blinded to treatment allocation. The primary outcome is the incremental shuttle walk test at 4 months. Secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life (HRQoL), time to clinical worsening and health and social care use. A purposive sample of participants (n = 20 intervention and n = 20 control) and practitioners (n = 20) will be interviewed to explore experiences of the trial, outcomes and interventions. DISCUSSION: The SPHERe study is the first multi-centre clinical RCT to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of a supervised exercise rehabilitation intervention compared to usual care, delivered in the UK NHS, for people in all PH groups. Results will inform clinicians and commissioners as to whether or not supervised exercise rehabilitation is effective and should be routinely provided for people with PH.

The purpose of this study was to describe the indications, epidemiology, frequency, and associated factors for tracheostomy in critically ill paediatric patients using the data available in the Japanese Registry of Paediatric Acute Care (JaRPAC). METHODS: This multicentre epidemiologic study collected data concerning paediatric tracheostomy from the JaRPAC database. Patients were divided into two groups: those with or without tracheostomies when they were discharged from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). Consecutive patients aged \u226416 years who did not undergo tracheostomy when admitted to ICU or PICU between April 2014 and March 2017 were included. RESULTS: A total of 23 hospitals participated, involving 6199 paediatric patients registered in the JaRPAC database during the study period. Of the registered paediatric patients, 5769 (95%) patients were admitted to the ICUs or PICUs without tracheostomies. Among the patients, 181 patients (3.1%) had undergone tracheostomies. There were significant differences in chronic conditions (134, 74.0% versus 3096, 55.4%, p < 0.01), chromosomal anomalies (19, 10.5% versus 326, 5.8%, p < 0.01), urgent admission (151, 83.4% versus 3093, 55.4%, p < 0.01). More tracheostomies were performed on patients who were admitted for respiratory failure (61, 33.7% versus 926, 16.1%, p < 0.01) and for post-cardiac pulmonary arrest (CPA) resuscitation (40, 22.1% versus 71, 1.1%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to use a large-scale registry of critically ill paediatric patients in Japan to describe the interrelated factors of tracheostomies. Chronic conditions (especially for neuromuscular disease), chromosomal anomaly, admission due to respiratory failure, or treatment for post-CPA resuscitation all had the possibility to be risk factors for tracheostomy.",

        "doi": "10.1007\/s12028-020-00986-4",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\/OBJECTIVE: Neurostimulants may improve or accelerate cognitive and functional recovery after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), ischemic stroke (IS), or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), but few studies have described their safety and effectiveness in the intensive care unit (ICU). The objective of this study was to describe amantadine and modafinil administration practices during acute stroke care starting in the ICU and to evaluate safety and effectiveness. METHODS: Consecutive adult ICU patients treated with amantadine and\/or modafinil following acute non-traumatic IS, ICH, or SAH were evaluated. Neurostimulant administration data were extracted from the electronic medication administration record, including medication (amantadine, modafinil, or both), starting dose, time from stroke to initiation, and whether the neurostimulant was continued at hospital discharge. Patients were considered responders if they met two of three criteria within 9 days of neurostimulant initiation: increase in Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score \u2265 3 points from pre-treatment baseline, improved wakefulness or participation documented in caregiver notes, or clinical improvement documented in physical or occupational therapy notes. Potential confounders of the effectiveness assessment and adverse drug effects were also recorded. RESULTS: A total of 87 patients were evaluable during the 3.7-year study period, including 41 (47%) with ICH, 29 (33%) with IS, and 17 (20%) with SAH. The initial neurostimulant administered was amantadine in 71 (82%) patients, modafinil in 13 (15%), or both in 3 (3%) patients. Neurostimulants were initiated a median of 7 (4.25, 12.75) days post-stroke (range 1\u201327 days) for somnolence (77%), not following commands (32%), lack of eye opening (28%), or low GCS (17%). The most common starting dose was 100 mg twice daily for both amantadine (86%) and modafinil (54%). Of the 79 patients included in the effectiveness evaluation, 42 (53%) were considered responders, including 34\/62 (55%) receiving amantadine monotherapy and 8\/24 (33%) receiving both amantadine and modafinil at the time they met the definition of a responder. No patient receiving modafinil monotherapy was considered a responder. The median time from initiation to response was 3 (2, 5) days. Responders were more frequently discharged home or to acute rehabilitation compared to non-responders (90% vs 62%, p = 0.006). Among survivors, 63\/72 (88%) were prescribed a neurostimulant at hospital discharge. The most common potential adverse drug effect was sleep disruption (16%). CONCLUSIONS: Neurostimulant administration during acute stroke care may improve wakefulness. Future controlled studies with a neurostimulant administration protocol, prospective evaluation, and discretely defined response and safety criteria are needed to confirm these encouraging findings.

Progress in monitoring and understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of IH allows the implementation of targeted interventions in order to improve the outcome of these patients. Initially, general prophylactic measures such as patient\u2019s head elevation, fever control, adequate analgesia and sedation depth should be applied immediately to all patients with suspected IH. Based on specific indications and conditions, surgical resection of mass lesions and cerebrospinal fluid drainage should be considered as an initial treatment for lowering ICP. Hyperosmolar therapy (mannitol or hypertonic saline) represents the cornerstone of medical treatment of acute IH while hyperventilation should be limited to emergency management of life-threatening raised ICP. Therapeutic hypothermia could have a possible benefit on outcome. To control elevated ICP refractory to maximum standard medical and surgical treatment, at first, high-dose barbiturate administration and then decompressive craniectomy as a last step are recommended with unclear and probable benefit on outcomes, respectively. The therapeutic strategy should be based on a staircase approach and be individualized for each patient. Since most therapeutic interventions have an uncertain effect on neurological outcome and mortality, future research should focus on both studying the long-term benefits of current strategies and developing new ones.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) is a way of giving surfactant without endotracheal intubation and has shown to be promising in reducing the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. However, the mechanism underlying its beneficial effect and variations in the technique of administration may prevent its widespread use. This trial aims to evaluate the effects of two methods of surfactant administration, LISA or endotracheal surfactant administration followed by low peak pressure (LPPSA) ventilation, in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). METHODS: The LISA Or Low Peak Pressure trial is to be conducted in 14 tertiary neonatal intensive care units in China. A total of 600 preterm infants born with gestational age between 25(0\/7) and 31(6\/7) weeks and with a primary diagnosis of RDS will be involved in the study. Infants will be randomized to the LISA or LPPSA group when surfactant therapy is indicated. Primary outcomes include mortality, severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age (PMA), and mechanical ventilation (MV) in the first 72 h of life. Secondary outcomes include the days of MV, duration of all sorts of non-invasive respiratory support, fraction of inspired oxygen, oxygen saturation before and after surfactant administration, and time required to perform the procedure for surfactant administration. The incidence of comorbidities, including retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA), pneumothorax, and massive pulmonary hemorrhage within 48 h of surfactant administration, and the failure rates of each technique will be determined. DISCUSSION: Data from recent systematic review and meta-analysis have suggested a possible improvement in outcomes of preterm infants with RDS by the LISA technique. However, robust evidence is lacking. Why LISA plays a potential role in reducing respiratory morbidity, mainly BPD in preterm infants, remains unclear. The possible explanations are the active and uninterrupted delivery of continuous positive airway pressure during the LISA procedure and the avoidance of complications caused by intubation and relatively high pressure\/volume ventilation following surfactant administration. We hypothesized that LISA\u2019s effectiveness lies mainly in avoiding relatively high-pressure positive ventilation immediately following surfactant administration. Thus, this multicenter randomized controlled trial will focus on issues of endotracheal intubation and the pressure\/volume used during conventional surfactant administration. The effectiveness, safety and comorbidities of preterm infants following LISA or LPPSA will be evaluated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR1900020970.

The model was ventilated by HFPV with a pulse inspiratory peak pressure (work pressure P(work)) augmented in 5-cmH(2)O steps from 20 to 45 cmH(2)O, yielding 6 diverse airflows. The percussive frequency (f) was set to 300, 500 and 700 cycles\/min, respectively. Pressure (Paw and Ptr) and flow (V\u2019) measurements were performed for all 162 possible combinations of loads, frequencies, and work pressures for each TT size, thus yielding 486 determinations. For each respiratory cycle \u0394P(TT) was calculated by subtracting each peak Ptr from its corresponding peak Paw. A non-linear model was constructed to assess the relationships between single parameters. Performance of the produced model was measured in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (r(2)). \u0394P(TT) was predicted by P(work) (exponential Gaussian relationship), resistance (quadratic and linear terms), frequency (quadratic and linear terms) and tube diameter (linear term), but not by compliance. RMSE of the model on the testing dataset was 1.17 cmH(2)O, r(2) was 0.79 and estimation error was lower than 1 cmH(2)O in 68% of cases. As a result, even without a flow value, the physician would be able to evaluate \u0394P(TT) pressure. If the present results of our bench study could be clinically confirmed, the use of a nonconventional ventilatory strategy as HFPV, would be safer and easier.",

Here we applied this method on newborn piglets with induced lung complications. METHODS: Five mechanically ventilated piglets were subjected to stepwise increased and decreased fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)), to atelectasis using a balloon catheter in the right bronchus, and to pneumothorax by injecting air in the pleural cavity. Two diode lasers (764 nm for O(2) gas absorption and 820 nm for H(2)O absorption) were combined in a probe delivering light either externally, on the skin, or internally, through the esophagus. The detector probe was placed dermally. RESULTS: Calculated O(2) concentrations increased from 20% (IQR 17\u221223%) when ventilated with room air to 97% (88\u2212108%) at FiO(2) 1.0. H(2)O was only detectable with the internal light source. Specific light absorption and transmission patterns were identified in response to atelectasis and pneumothorax, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The optical method detected FiO(2) variations and discriminated the two induced lung pathologies, providing a rationale for further development into a minimally invasive device for real-time monitoring gas changes in the lungs of sick newborn infants. IMPACT: Optical spectroscopy can detect pulmonary complications in an animal model. Oxygen concentrations can be evaluated in the lungs. Presents a novel minimally invasive method to detect lung oxygenation and complications. Potential to be developed into a lung monitoring method in newborn infants.

        "abstract": "Background: During the past two years, 5% of patients admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) of Hamad General Hospital (HGH) had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a PaO(2)\/FiO(2) ratio less than 100 mmHg. The risks associated with this condition include ventilator associated lung injury, over distension of lungs, and poor gas exchange which results in increased morbidity and mortality. With quality improvement initiatives like prone positioning, the mortality and morbidity associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome(1) can be reduced by improving hypoxemia(2) with a significant enhancement in PaO(2)\/FiO(2) ratios while reducing injurious ventilation. Also, prone positioning can help prevent invasive interventions such as placing patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy.(3) Methods: We evaluated the safety of prone positioning for improving hypoxemia in critically ill patients with PaO(2)\/FiO(2) ratio < 100 mmHg to PaO(2)\/FiO(2) ratio < 200 mmHg from 1(st) January 2017 to 31(st) December 2018, without major complications. Data collected included the PaO(2)\/FiO(2) ratios based on arterial blood gases of mechanically ventilated patients before and after prone positioning. We were able to facilitate prone positioning in 72 out of 110 patients with severe ARDS having a total average PaO(2)\/FiO(2) ratio of 84.4 \u00b1 30 mmHg. The patients were proned for a maximum of 16 hours in each session where up to three sessions were incorporated. No major complications were encountered during the proning sessions. This was thought to be accomplished through the coordination of a dedicated multidisciplinary team, education and simulation classes for physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists, following appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria for prone positioning, and implementing quality measures through Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles as represented in Figure 1. Results: The total average PaO(2)\/FiO(2) ratio before proning for 65% of patients (n = 72) with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome(4) was 84.4 \u00b1 30 mmHg and after one hour of 16 hours proning, it improved to 180.3 \u00b1 78 mmHg. The remaining 35% of patients either had traumatic fractures, unstable spinal injury, severe hemodynamic instability, or morbid obesity together with ARDS which made them unfavorable for prone positioning. Out of those who were proned, 11 (12.5%) patients did not have improvement in oxygenation after proning due to non-recruitable lungs and were put on ECMO. The PaO(2)\/FiO(2) ratios before and after one hour of implementing the prone position technique in each quarter of 2017 and 2018 are represented in Figure 2. Conclusion: \u2022 Sustaining and standardizing the accomplished work of data collection. \u2022 Implementing the prone positioning technique across other critical care units of Hamad Medical Corporation. \u2022 Keeping a record of minor complications associated with prone positioning and resolving them in further sessions. \u2022 Documenting cases with contraindications to prone positioning.",

        "abstract": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatens to overwhelm our medical infrastructure at the regional level causing spikes in mortality rates because of shortages of critical equipment, like ventilators. Fortunately, with the recent development and widespread deployment of small-scale manufacturing technologies like RepRap-class 3-D printers and open source microcontrollers, mass distributed manufacturing of ventilators has the potential to overcome medical supply shortages. In this study, after providing a background on ventilators, the academic literature is reviewed to find the existing and already openly-published, vetted designs for ventilators systems. These articles are analyzed to determine if the designs are open source both in spirit (license) as well as practical details (e.g. possessing accessible design source files, bill of materials, assembly instructions, wiring diagrams, firmware and software as well as operation and calibration instructions). Next, the existing Internet and gray literature are reviewed for open source ventilator projects and designs. The results of this review found that the tested and peer-reviewed systems lacked complete documentation and the open systems that were documented were either at the very early stages of design (sometimes without even a prototype) and were essentially only basically tested (if at all). With the considerably larger motivation of an ongoing pandemic, it is assumed these projects will garner greater attention and resources to make significant progress to reach a functional and easily-replicated system. There is a large amount of future work needed to move open source ventilators up to the level considered scientific-grade equipment, and even further work needed to reach medical-grade hardware. Future work is needed to achieve the potential of this approach by developing policies, updating regulations, and securing funding mechanisms for the development and testing of open source ventilators for both the current COVID19 pandemic as well as for future pandemics and for everyday use in low-resource settings.",

However, few centers have started using these approaches with standard equipment because of the limited resources. We sought to report intra- and postoperative clinical outcomes and address health resource utilization after MIAVR. RESULTS: A total of 102 eligible patients who had aortic valve replacement were enrolled in a prospective, multicenter cohort study conducted from June 2015 to December 2017. Fifty patients underwent aortic valve surgery via upper inverted T-shaped hemi-sternotomy (MS), and 52 patients were operated using full sternotomy (FS) in two centers in a developing country. Central cannulation was performed in all cases. Major adverse cardiac events, pain, and wound complications were compared. A cost analysis was performed, and exposure and feasibility for cannulation were assessed. The mean length of MS skin incision was 5.82 \u00b1 0.67 cm. Cumulative cross-clamp time was insignificant between both groups (91.87 \u00b1 34.41 versus 94.91 \u00b1 33.96 min; p = 0.66). MS exhibited shorter ventilation time (6.18 \u00b1 1.86 versus 10.68 \u00b1 12.78 h; p = 0.029) and intensive care stays (33.27 \u00b1 19.75 versus 49.42 \u00b1 47.1 h; p = 0.037). Major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) were compared, and MS group exhibited fewer transfusions (1.18 \u00b1 0.89 versus 1.7 \u00b1 0.97 units; p = 0.002), fewer pulmonary complications (1 (2%) versus 2 (3.8%); p < 0.001), and less sternotomy wound infection (1 (2%) versus 5 (9.6%); p = 0.048). Total operative mortality of 4.46% was recorded (n = 5). Significant cost reduction was recorded favoring MS; central cannulation saved $907.16 and carried a total cost reduction of $580 (9.3%) when compared with the FS approach (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: With a lack of logistics in developing countries, MIAVR not only has a cosmetic advantage but carries a significant reduction in blood use, respiratory complications, pain, and cost. MIAVR can be feasible, with a rapid learning curve in developing centers.",

Routine management with opioid and or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications has several disadvantages. Dexmedetomidine is a selective \u03b12 agonist used for sedation and analgesia. The use of dexmedetomidine for postoperative pain management and decreasing delirium and agitation in cardiac surgery patients is a matter of debate. Our objective was to determine the role of an early administration of dexmedetomidine in decreasing opioid use post-cardiac surgery and its effects on the quality of postoperative recovery. RESULTS: Medical records of 120 patients admitted to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit (CSICU) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in two cardiac centers between December 2015 and December 2016 were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups. Group A included 55 patients who received dexmedetomidine in a dose of 0.2\u20130.4 mcg\/kg\/h on admission to CSICU, and group B included 65 patients who did not receive dexmedetomidine. The primary outcome was the pain score immediately after extubation, and the secondary outcomes included post-extubation sedation and pain scores for 12 h. There were significant decrease of the pain scores in dexmedetomidine group that continues through the 3rd, 6th, 8th, and 12th hour readings after surgery with mean modified Ramsay scores 0.1 \u00b1 0.0, 0.89 \u00b1 2.05, 0.35 \u00b1 0.1, and 0.12 \u00b1 1.1 respectively compared to 0.46 \u00b1 1.15, 3.46 \u00b1 2.93, 0.98 \u00b1 1.90, and 0.12 \u00b1 1.1 in group B (p < 0.001), significant decrease in cumulative morphine received (p < 0.001, OR = 909, 95% CI 0.05\u20130.19), favorable reduction in heart rate in dexmedetomidine group (80 \u00b1 1.9 b\/min) compared to 96 \u00b1 8.8 b\/min in the other group (p = 0.017), and smoother recovery from general anesthesia. CONCLUSION: Administration of dexmedetomidine in the early postoperative period can be safe. It may reduce the use of opioids, has sedative, analgesic, and sympatholytic effects that could play a useful role during the management of coronary artery bypass patients, and may improve postoperative recovery.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In ARDS patients, mechanical ventilation should minimize ventilator-induced lung injury. The mechanical power which is the energy per unit time released to the respiratory system according to the applied tidal volume, PEEP, respiratory rate, and flow should reflect the ventilator-induced lung injury. However, similar levels of mechanical power applied in different lung sizes could be associated to different effects. The aim of this study was to assess the role both of the mechanical power and of the transpulmonary mechanical power, normalized to predicted body weight, respiratory system compliance, lung volume, and amount of aerated tissue on intensive care mortality. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of ARDS patients previously enrolled in seven published studies. All patients were sedated, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated. After 20 min from a recruitment maneuver, partitioned respiratory mechanics measurements and blood gas analyses were performed with a PEEP of 5 cmH(2)O while the remaining setting was maintained unchanged from the baseline. A whole lung CT scan at 5 cmH(2)O of PEEP was performed to estimate the lung gas volume and the amount of well-inflated tissue. Univariate and multivariable Poisson regression models with robust standard error were used to calculate risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals of ICU mortality. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-two ARDS patients were included; 88 (40%) died in ICU. Mechanical power was not different between survivors and non-survivors 14.97 [11.51\u201318.44] vs. 15.46 [12.33\u201321.45] J\/min and did not affect intensive care mortality. The multivariable robust regression models showed that the mechanical power normalized to well-inflated tissue (RR 2.69 [95% CI 1.10\u20136.56], p = 0.029) and the mechanical power normalized to respiratory system compliance (RR 1.79 [95% CI 1.16\u20132.76], p = 0.008) were independently associated with intensive care mortality after adjusting for age, SAPS II, and ARDS severity. Also, transpulmonary mechanical power normalized to respiratory system compliance and to well-inflated tissue significantly increased intensive care mortality (RR 1.74 [1.11\u20132.70], p = 0.015; RR 3.01 [1.15\u20137.91], p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: In our ARDS population, there is not a causal relationship between the mechanical power itself and mortality, while mechanical power normalized to the compliance or to the amount of well-aerated tissue is independently associated to the intensive care mortality. Further studies are needed to confirm this data.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: No recommendation exists about the timing and setting for tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in septic shock. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective multicenter observational study was conducted in 30 ICUs in France and Spain. All consecutive patients presenting with septic shock were eligible. The use of tracheal intubation was described across the participating ICUs. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify parameters associated with early intubation (before H8 following vasopressor onset). RESULTS: Eight hundred and fifty-nine patients were enrolled. Two hundred and nine patients were intubated early (24%, range 4.5\u201347%), across the 18 centers with at least 20 patients included. The cumulative intubation rate during the ICU stay was 324\/859 (38%, range 14\u201365%). In the multivariate analysis, seven parameters were significantly associated with early intubation and ranked as follows by decreasing weight: Glasgow score, center effect, use of accessory respiratory muscles, lactate level, vasopressor dose, pH and inability to clear tracheal secretions. Global R-square of the model was only 60% indicating that 40% of the variability of the intubation process was related to other parameters than those entered in this analysis. CONCLUSION: Neurological, respiratory and hemodynamic parameters only partially explained the use of tracheal intubation in septic shock patients. Center effect was important. Finally, a vast part of the variability of intubation remained unexplained by patient characteristics.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Acute traumatic coagulopathy can result in uncontrolled haemorrhage responsible for the majority of early deaths after adult trauma. Data on the frequency, transfusion practice and outcome of severe trauma haemorrhage in paediatric patients are inconsistent. METHODS: Datasets from paediatric trauma patients were retrieved from the registry of the German trauma society (TR-DGU(\u00ae)) between 2009 and 2016. Coagulopathy was defined by a Quick\u2019s value < 70% (INR (international normalized ratio) > 1.4) and\/or thrombocytes \u2264 100 k upon emergency room admission. Children were grouped according to age in 4 different groups (A: 1\u20135, B: 6\u201310, C: 11\u201315 and D: 16\u201317 years). Prevalence of coagulopathy was assessed. Demographics, injury severity, haemostatic management including transfusions and mortality were described. RESULTS: 5351 primary admitted children \u2264 17 years with an abbreviated injury scale (AIS) \u2265 3 and complete datasets were included. The prevalence of coagulopathy was 13.7% (733\/5351). The majority of the children sustained blunt trauma (more than 90% independent of age group) and a combination of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and any other trauma in more than 60% (A, C, D) and in 53.8% in group B. Coagulopathy occurred the most among the youngest (A: 18.2%), followed by all other age groups with approximately 13%. Overall mortality was the highest in the youngest (A: 40.9%) and among the youngest patients with traumatic brain injury (A: 71.4% and B: 47.1%). Transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFPs) occurred almost in a 2:1 ratio (or less) across all age subgroups. CONCLUSION: Traumatic haemorrhage in association with coagulopathy and severe shock is a major challenge in paediatric trauma across all age groups.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Therapeutic extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a challenging procedure in patients who have experienced severe trauma. Particularly, patients with traumatic lung injury and posttraumatic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have a high risk of bleeding during this procedure. This study aimed to determine the safety and feasibility of ECMO in patients with traumatic ARDS. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records and investigated the clinical outcomes of ECMO in 42 patients with traumatic ARDS, among whom near-drowning (42.9%) was the most frequent cause of injury. RESULTS: Thirty-four of 42 patients (81%) survived and were discharged after a median hospital stay of 23 days. A multivariate analysis identified a lactate level (odds ratio: 1.493, 95% confidence interval: 1.060\u20132.103, P = 0.022) and veno-venous (VV) ECMO (odds ratio: 0.075, 95% confidence interval: 0.006\u20130.901, P = 0.041) as favorable independent predictors of survival in patients with traumatic ARDS who underwent ECMO. The optimal cut off value for pre-ECMO lactate level was 10.5 mmol\/L (area under the curve = 0.929, P = 0.001). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the survival rate at hospital discharge was significant higher among the patients with a pre-ECMO lactate level of 10.5 mmol\/L or less compared with patients with pre-ECMO lactate level greater than 10.5 mmol\/L (93.8% versus 40.0%, respectively; P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: ECMO yielded excellent survival outcomes, particularly in patients with low pre-treatment lactate levels who received VV ECMO. Therefore, ECMO appears safe and highly feasible in a carefully selected population of trauma patients.",

        "abstract": "Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) can be an effective modality to address challenges that arise daily in the intensive care unit (ICU). These medications are often used to optimize mechanical ventilation, facilitate endotracheal intubation, stop overt shivering during therapeutic hypothermia following cardiac arrest, and may have a role in the management of life-threatening conditions such as elevated intracranial pressure and status asthmaticus (when deep sedation fails or is not tolerated). However, current NMBA use has decreased during the last decade due to concerns of potential adverse effects such as venous thrombosis, patient awareness during paralysis, development of critical illness myopathy, autonomic interactions, and even residual paralysis following cessation of NMBA use. It is therefore essential for clinicians to be familiar with evidence-based practices regarding appropriate NMBA use in order to select appropriate indications for their use and avoid complications. We believe that selecting the right NMBA, administering concomitant sedation and analgesic therapy, and using appropriate monitoring techniques mitigate these risks for critically ill patients. Therefore, we review the indications of NMBA use in the critical care setting and discuss the most appropriate use of NMBAs in the intensive care setting based on their structure, mechanism of action, side effects, and recognized clinical indications. Lastly, we highlight the available pharmacologic antagonists, strategies for sedation, newer neuromuscular monitoring techniques, and potential complications related to the use of NMBAs in the ICU setting.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prone position (PP) is highly recommended in moderate-to-severe ARDS. However, the optimal duration of PP sessions remains unclear. We searched to evaluate the time required to obtain the maximum physiological effect, and to search for parameters related to patient survival in PP. METHODS AND RESULTS: It was a prospective, monocentric, physiological study. We included in the study all prone-positioned patients in our ICU between June 2016 and January 2018. Pulmonary mechanics, data from volumetric capnography and arterial blood gas were recorded before prone positioning, 2 h after proning, before return to a supine position (SP) and 2 h after return to SP. Dynamic parameters were recorded before proning and every 30 min during the session until 24 h. 103 patients (ARDS 95%) were included performing 231 PP sessions with a mean length of 21.5 \u00b1 5 h per session. They presented a significant increase in pH, static compliance and P(a)O(2)\/F(i)O(2) with a significant decrease in P(a)CO(2), P(plat), phase 3 slope of the volumetric capnography, P(et)CO(2), V(D)\/V(T-phy) and \u0394P. The beneficial physiological effects continued after 16 h of PP and at least up to 24 h in some patients. The evolution of the respiratory parameters during the first session and also during the pooled sessions did not find any predictor of response to PP, whether before, during or 2 h after the return in SP. CONCLUSIONS: PP sessions should be prolonged at least 24 h and be extended in the event that the P(a)O(2)\/F(i)O(2) ratio at 24 h remains below 150, especially since no criteria can predict which patient will benefit or not from it.

Moreover, the impact of fluid administration as drug diluent or to preserve catheter patency, i.e., fluid creep, should also be considered. As for antibiotics, intravenous fluid administration should follow the four Ds: drug, dosing, duration, de-escalation. Among crystalloids, balanced solutions limit acid\u2013base alterations and chloride load and should be preferred, as this likely prevents renal dysfunction. Among colloids, albumin, the only available natural colloid, may have beneficial effects. The last decade has seen growing interest in the potential harms related to fluid overloading. In the perioperative setting, appropriate fluid management that maintains adequate organ perfusion while limiting fluid administration should represent the standard of care. Protocols including a restrictive continuous fluid administration alongside bolus administration to achieve hemodynamic targets have been proposed. A similar approach should be considered also for critically ill patients, in whom increased endothelial permeability makes this strategy more relevant. Active de-escalation protocols may be necessary in a later phase. The R.O.S.E. conceptual model (Resuscitation, Optimization, Stabilization, Evacuation) summarizes accurately a dynamic approach to fluid therapy, maximizing benefits and minimizing harms. Even in specific categories of critically ill patients, i.e., with trauma or burns, fluid therapy should be carefully applied, considering the importance of their specific aims; maintaining peripheral oxygen delivery, while avoiding the consequences of fluid overload.",

We randomised 58 preterm infants of 28\u201334 weeks of gestation with RDS within 6 h of birth to receive surfactant by InSurE or minimally invasive surfactant therapy (MIST). Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) was used as primary respiratory support.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inappropriate ventilator assist plays an important role in the development of diaphragm dysfunction. Ventilator under-assist may lead to muscle injury, while over-assist may result in muscle atrophy. This provides a good rationale to monitor respiratory drive in ventilated patients. Respiratory drive can be monitored by a nasogastric catheter, either with esophageal balloon to determine muscular pressure (gold standard) or with electrodes to measure electrical activity of the diaphragm. A disadvantage is that both techniques are invasive. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate the role of surrogate markers for respiratory dive, such as extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscle activity. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of different inspiratory support levels on the recruitment pattern of extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscles with respect to the diaphragm and to evaluate agreement between activity of extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscles and the diaphragm. METHODS: Activity from the alae nasi, genioglossus, scalene, sternocleidomastoid and parasternal intercostals was recorded using surface electrodes. Electrical activity of the diaphragm was measured using a multi-electrode nasogastric catheter. Pressure support (PS) levels were reduced from 15 to 3 cmH(2)O every 5 min with steps of 3 cmH(2)O. The magnitude and timing of respiratory muscle activity were assessed. RESULTS: We included 17 ventilated patients. Diaphragm and extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscle activity increased in response to lower PS levels (36 \u00b1 6% increase for the diaphragm, 30 \u00b1 6% parasternal intercostals, 41 \u00b1 6% scalene, 40 \u00b1 8% sternocleidomastoid, 43 \u00b1 6% alae nasi and 30 \u00b1 6% genioglossus). Changes in diaphragm activity correlated best with changes in alae nasi activity (r(2) = 0.49; P < 0.001), while there was no correlation between diaphragm and sternocleidomastoid activity. The agreement between diaphragm and extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscle activity was low due to a high individual variability. Onset of alae nasi activity preceded the onset of all other muscles. CONCLUSIONS: Extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscle activity increases in response to lower inspiratory support levels. However, there is a poor correlation and agreement with the change in diaphragm activity, limiting the use of surface electromyography (EMG) recordings of extradiaphragmatic inspiratory muscles as a surrogate for electrical activity of the diaphragm.",

Only a little is known about venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO)-related SCI. Retrospective observational study conducted, from 2006 to 2019, in a tertiary referral center on patients who developed VA-ECMO-related neurovascular complications, focusing on SCI. During this period, among the 1893 patients requiring VA-ECMO support, 112 (5.9%) developed an ECMO-related neurovascular injury: 65 (3.4%) ischemic strokes, 40 (2.1%) intracranial bleeding, one cerebral thrombophlebitis (0.05%) and 6 (0.3%) spinal cord infarction. Herein, we report a series of six patients with refractory cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest receiving circulatory support with VA-ECMO who developed subsequent SCI during ECMO course, confirmed by spine MRI after ECMO withdrawal. All six patients had long-term neurological disabilities. VA-ECMO-related SCI is a rare but catastrophic complication. Its diagnosis is usually delayed due to sedation requirement and\/or ICU acquired weakness after sedation withdrawal, leading to difficulties in monitoring their neurological status. Even if no specific treatment exist for SCI, its prompt diagnosis is mandatory, to prevent secondary spine insults of systemic origin. Based on these results, we suggest that daily sedation interruption and neurological exam of the lower limbs should be performed in all VA-ECMO patients. Large registries are mandatory to determine VA-ECMO-related SCI risk factor and potential therapy.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate characteristics and outcomes of newly developed stroke in patients admitted to the non-neurological intensive care units (ICU-onset stroke, IOS). METHODS: A consecutive series of adult patients who were admitted to the non-neurological ICU were included in this study. We compared neurological profiles, risk factors, and mortality rates between patients with IOS and those without IOS. RESULTS: Of 18,604 patients admitted to the ICU for non-neurological illness, 218 (1.2%) developed stroke (ischemic, n = 182; hemorrhagic, n = 36). The most common neurological presentation was altered mental status (n = 149), followed by hemiparesis (n = 55), and seizures (n = 28). The most common etiology of IOS was cardioembolism (50% [91\/182]) for ischemic IOS and coagulopathy (67% [24\/36]) for hemorrhagic IOS. In multivariable analysis, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03\u22121.06, P < 0.001), prothrombin time (AOR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.98\u22120.99, P = 0.013), cardiovascular surgery (AOR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.34\u22122.50, P < 0.001), mechanical ventilation (AOR = 6.75, 95% CI = 4.87\u22129.45, P < 0.001), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (AOR = 2.77, 95% CI = 1.62\u22124.55, P < 0.001) were related to the development of IOS. Stroke was associated with increased 3-month mortality after hospital discharge (AOR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.58\u20133.05; P < 0.001), after adjustment for APACHE II and comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who developed IOS had characteristics of initial critical illness and managements performed in the ICU as well as neurological presentations.

Organizational factors may play a role on adherence to LTVV. The present study aimed to identify organizational factors with an independent association with adherence to LTVV. METHODS: Secondary analysis of the database of a multicenter two-phase study (prospective cohort followed by a cluster-randomized trial) performed in 118 Brazilian intensive care units. Patients under mechanical ventilation at day 2 were included. LTVV was defined as a V(T) \u2264 8 ml\/kg PBW on the second day of ventilation. Data on the type and number of beds of the hospital, teaching status, nursing, respiratory therapists and physician staffing, use of structured checklist, and presence of protocols were tested. A multivariable mixed-effect model was used to assess the association between organizational factors and adherence to LTVV. RESULTS: The study included 5719 patients; 3340 (58%) patients received LTVV. A greater number of hospital beds (absolute difference 7.43% [95% confidence interval 0.61\u201314.24%]; p = 0.038), use of structured checklist during multidisciplinary rounds (5.10% [0.55\u20139.81%]; p = 0.030), and presence of at least one nurse per 10 patients during all shifts (17.24% [0.85\u201333.60%]; p = 0.045) were the only three factors that had an independent association with adherence to LTVV. CONCLUSIONS: Number of hospital beds, use of a structured checklist during multidisciplinary rounds, and nurse staffing are organizational factors associated with adherence to LTVV.

        "doi": "10.1007\/s40272-020-00404-4",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Caffeine is a common treatment for neonatal intensive care management of the developmental complication of apnea of prematurity in preterm infants. There are several systematic reviews (SRs) on the performance of caffeine in the treatment of apnea. The evidence provided by those, however, is depressed by an information overload due to high heterogeneity in the characteristics as well as the quality of these SRs. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to provide a systematic overview of SRs on the use of caffeine for the management of neonatal apnea. Such overviews are a recent method used to assess and filter top evidence among SRs, enabling enhanced access to targeted information of interest. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted via EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), and PubMed since inception to January 2020. Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and data extraction, and assessed the quality of methods and the risk of bias in included SRs based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2) and Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tools. Extracted data related to study type, characteristics, patients, intervention, comparator, regimen, and outcome measures. RESULTS: Seven SRs with meta-analyses (SRMAs) were included in the current overview, involving a total of 63,315 neonates. SRMAs included randomized clinical and observational studies, with various types of patients, comparators, and outcomes. The quality of SRMAs ranged from critically low (n = 1), low (n = 1), moderate (n = 2), to high (n = 3), and the risk of bias was unclear (n = 2), low (n = 4), and high (n = 1). The effectiveness of caffeine with regard to treatment success and the rate of apnea was not significantly different from that of theophylline or doxapram in two SRMAs. Against control, in one SRMA, while caffeine reduced the rate of failure as well as the need for pressure ventilation, it did not significantly reduce mortality. This comparative effectiveness of caffeine was based on high-quality SRMAs with a low risk of bias. The effectiveness against apnea seems to be enhanced via the administration of early (0\u20132 days) or high doses of caffeine in one and three SRMAs, respectively. This, nevertheless, was based on lower-quality SRMAs with a higher risk of bias. Safety outcomes were mostly based on comparative SRMAs of different drug regimens, whereby, less tachycardia and lower risk for complications were reported with lower and earlier caffeine administrations, respectively. The evidence behind this, however, was limited in quantity and quality. CONCLUSION: While limited in quantity, there is evidence of non-inferior effectiveness of caffeine against other methylxanthines or doxapram for the management of apnea in neonates. Owing to the limited quality, however, limited evidence exists in support of an optimal administration regimen for caffeine. Further controlled studies are, therefore, needed to confirm the comparative usefulness of caffeine as well as to assess its different potential regimens, including in relation to safety.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To analyze the efficacy of minimally invasive beating heart technique for mitral valve surgery in the cardiac patients with previous sternotomy and giant left ventricle. METHODS: Eighty cardiac patients with previous sternotomy and giant left ventricle according to the diagnostic criteria that left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) was \u226570 mm, who underwent mitral valve surgery at our center from January 2006 to January 2019 were analyzed. We divided all patients into minimally invasive beating heart technique group (n = 30) and conventional median resternotomy arrested heart technique group (n = 50) according to the surgical methods. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were compared between two groups. RESULTS: Minimally invasive beating heart technique compared to the conventional median resternotomy arrested heart technique for mitral valve surgery in the cardiac patients with previous sternotomy and giant left ventricle had significant differences in operation time(P = 0.002), cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time(P < 0.001), intraoperative blood loss(P < 0.001), postoperative transfusion ratio(P = 0.01), postoperative transfusion amount(P < 0.001), postoperative drainage volume(P = 0.001), extubation time(P = 0.04), intensive care unit (ICU) stay time(P = 0.04) and postoperative hospital stay time(P < 0.001), but no significant differences in re-exploration for bleeding, postoperative 30-day mortality, postoperative complications and 6 months postoperative echocardiographic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Using the method of minimally invasive beating heart technique for mitral valve surgery in the cardiac patients with previous sternotomy and giant left ventricle is effective and reliable, meanwhile reduce the operation time and CPB time, decrease the transfusion ratio and transfusion amount, shorten postoperative ICU stay and hospital stay time, promote the early extubation so that accelerate the patients\u2019 early recovery.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stress response always occurs in cardiac valve replacement patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). METHODS: 60 patients undergoing cardiac valve replacement were recruited and randomized into control and Dex groups. Dex group received 1.0 \u03bcg\u00b7kg-1 of Dex for 10 min intravenously before anesthesia, followed by 0.5 \u03bcg\u00b7kg-1\u00b7h-1 of Dex, steadily administered throughout the procedure. And controlled group received the identical velocity of saline as Dex group. Plasma level of cortisol (Cor), epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT) were evaluated at four timepoints: Before administration (T0), sawn sternum (T1), end of extracorporeal circulation (T2), and 24 h post operation (T3). General data of operation and recovery such as heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), intraoperative bispectral index (BIS), and hospitalization time in the intensive care unit (ICU) were also compared. RESULTS: Increase of Cor, E, NE, and 5-HT for the Dex group was significant lesser than that in the control group (P < 0.05), and ICU hospitalization time and ventilator support time was significantly shorter in the Dex group. The proportion of patients discharged from the hospital with better prognosis was significantly higher than that in the control group, while there were no significant differences in hospitalization costs and vasoactive drugs use between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Dex reduces plasma Cor, E and NE elevations in patients after CPB, alleviates the stress reaction of the body, shortens the hospitalization time and ventilator support time in ICU, and plays a positive role in the rehabilitation of patients undergoing cardiac valve replacement.

The aim of the study was to assess the cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1) and biomarkers (vWF, CC-16) in patients of thoracic trauma and correlate it with TTSS and patient\u2019s outcome. This was a prospective observational study. Serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples were collected from chest trauma patients. TTSS was calculated in all patients. Suitable controls for serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample were selected. The outcome parameters included patient discharge or death, duration of hospital, and intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Forty-three patients were included. There was no significant correlation between the measured cytokines and biomarkers and TTSS. The mean TTSS of patients who had a fatal outcome was significantly higher than the patients who recovered. Patients with a high TTSS score had a significant prolonged ICU stay. Patients with a prolonged hospital stay had lower values of CC-16. TTSS is a useful tool to predict severity of chest trauma and prolonged ICU stay. Lower levels of CC-16 in BAL fluid of chest trauma patients were associated with prolonged hospital stay suggestive of its protective role in the airway.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Preterm infants are a population at high risk for mortality and adverse health outcomes. With recent improvements in survival to childhood, increasing attention is being paid to risk of long-term morbidity, specifically during childhood and young-adulthood. Although numerous tools for predicting the functional outcomes of preterm neonates have been developed in the past three decades, no studies have provided a comprehensive overview of these tools, along with their strengths and weaknesses. The purpose of this article is to provide an in-depth, narrative review of the current risk models available for predicting the functional outcomes of preterm neonates. A total of 32 studies describing 43 separate models were considered. We found that most studies used similar physiologic variables and standard regression techniques to develop models that primarily predict the risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. With a recently expanded knowledge regarding the many factors that affect neurodevelopment and other important outcomes, as well as a better understanding of the limitations of traditional analytic methods, we argue that there is great room for improvement in creating risk prediction tools for preterm neonates. We also consider the ethical implications of utilizing these tools for clinical decision-making. IMPACT: Based on a literature review of risk prediction models for preterm neonates predicting functional outcomes, future models should aim for more consistent outcomes definitions, standardized assessment schedules and measurement tools, and consideration of risk beyond physiologic antecedents. Our review provides a comprehensive analysis and critique of risk prediction models developed for preterm neonates, specifically predicting functional outcomes instead of mortality, to reveal areas of improvement for future studies aiming to develop risk prediction tools for this population. To our knowledge, this is the first literature review and narrative analysis of risk prediction models for preterm neonates regarding their functional outcomes.",

        "doi": "10.1186\/s12883-020-01764-7",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation (MV) with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is commonly applied in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). However, the individual responsiveness of intracranial pressure (ICP) to PEEP varies. Thus, identifying an indicator detecting ICP responsiveness to PEEP is of great significance. As central venous pressure (CVP) could act as an intermediary to transduce pressure from PEEP to ICP, we developed a new indicator, P(IC)Gap, representing the gap between baseline ICP and baseline CVP. The aim of the current study was to explore the relationship between P(IC)Gap and ICP responsiveness to PEEP. METHODS: A total of 112 patients with sTBI undergoing MV were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. ICP, CVP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), static compliance of the respiratory system (Cst), and end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (PetCO(2)) were recorded at the initial (3 cmH(2)O) and adjusted (15 cmH(2)O) levels of PEEP. P(IC)Gap was assessed as baseline ICP - baseline CVP (when PEEP = 3 cmH(2)O). The patients were classified into the ICP responder and non-responder groups based on whether ICP increment with PEEP adjusted from 3 cmH(2)O to 15 cmH(2)O was greater than 20% of baseline ICP. The above parameters were compared between the two groups, and prediction of ICP responsiveness to PEEP adjustment was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Compared with the non-responder group, the responder group had lower P(IC)Gap (1.63 \u00b1 1.33 versus 6.56 \u00b1 2.46 mmHg; p < 0.001), lower baseline ICP, and higher baseline CVP. ROC curve analysis suggested that P(IC)Gap was a stronger predictive indicator of ICP responsiveness to PEEP (AUC = 0.957, 95%CI 0.918\u20130.996; p < 0.001) compared with baseline ICP and baseline CVP, with favorable sensitivity (95.24, 95%CI 86.91\u201398.70%) and specificity (87.6, 95%CI 75.76\u201394.27%), at a cut off value of 2.5 mmHg. CONCLUSION: The impact of PEEP on ICP depends on the gap between baseline ICP and baseline CVP, i.e. P(IC)Gap. In addition, P(IC)Gap is a potential predictor of ICP responsiveness to PEEP adjustment in patients with sTBI.",

The current study purposed to investigate if SORT maneuver (sniffing position, NGT orientation, contralateral rotation, and twisting movement) increases the success rate of NGT correct placement versus neck flexion lateral pressure (NFLP) method. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial study was conducted in two university affiliated intensive care units (tertiary referral center). Three hundred and ninety-six critically ill patients older than 18 years of age were randomly divided into SORT (n = 200) and NFLP (n = 196) groups. The technique was classified as \u201cfailed\u201d after the third unsuccessful attempt. Patient characteristics, success rate for the first attempt, time required for the successful first attempt and overall successful insertion time, various complications including kinking, coiling and bleeding and ease of insertion were noted as main outcomes measured. RESULTS: Ease of insertion was significantly better in the SORT group compared to the NFLP group (P < 0.001). The number of failed attempts was significantly higher in the NFLP group (7.5%) vs the SORT group (3.0%) (P = 0.046). The pattern of complications was not different between two study groups (P = 0.242). The odds of stage II (odds ratio (OR) = 49.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) 25.2 to 98.6), stage III (OR = 67.1; 95% CI 14.9 to 302.8)) and stage IV (OR = 11.8; 95% CI 3.4 to 41.2) ease of insertion were much higher in NFLP compared to SORT group, after adjusting for age and body mass index (BMI). The odds of failure was not significantly different in NFLP group compared to SORT group (OR = 2.3; 95% CI 0.85 to 6.3), after adjusting for age and BMI. CONCLUSIONS: SORT technique may be considered as a promising method for successful NGT insertions in critically ill patients. However, more trials are needed to confirm the results of this study. The decision must account for individual patient and clinical factors and the operator\u2019s experience and preference.

The optimal arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) levels for managing patients following OHCA are unknown. We hypothesized that abnormalities in arterial oxygenation (PaO(2)\/FiO(2) ratio or PaO(2)) and PaCO(2) would be associated with hospital mortality following OHCA. We hypothesized that PaCO(2) would significantly modify the oxygenation\u2013mortality relationship. METHODS: This was an observational cohort study using data from OHCA survivors admitted to adult critical care units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from 2011 to 2018. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between hospital mortality and oxygenation and PaCO(2). RESULTS: The analysis included 23,625 patients. In comparison with patients with a PaO(2)\/FiO(2) > 300 mmHg, those with a PaO(2)\/FiO(2) \u2264 100 mmHg had higher mortality (adjusted OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.48 to 2.15; P < 0.001).

PaCO(2) modified the PaO(2)\/FiO(2)\u2013mortality and PaO(2)\u2013mortality relationships, though these relationships were complex. Patients who were both hyperoxic and hypercapnic had the lowest mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Low PaO(2)\/FiO(2) ratio, hypoxemia and hypocapnia are associated with higher mortality following OHCA.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with majority of trauma deaths, and objective tools are required to understand the severity of injury. The application of a biomarker like procalcitonin (PCT) in TBI may allow for assessment of severity and thus aid in prognostication and correlation with mortality and outcome. AIMS: The primary objective is to determine the correlation between PCT concentrations with TBI outcomes (mainly in terms of mortality) at intensive care unit (ICU)\/hospital discharge. Secondary objectives are to evaluate correlation with associated extra cranial injuries and complications during hospital stay. METHODS: In total, 186 TBI patients aged > 18 years with minimum survival for at least 12 h admitted to the ICU at the level 1 trauma center were prospectively included in the study and divided into two groups: TBI with and without extra cranial injuries. All admitted patients were treated according to the standard institutional protocol. The PCT levels were obtained on admission, on day 2, and 5. Clinical, laboratory, diagnostic, and therapeutic data were also collected. Primary mortality is defined as death related to central nervous system (CNS) injury, while secondary mortality defined as death related to sepsis or extracranial cause. RESULTS: Median PCT levels at admission, day 2, and day 5 in TBI patients with extracranial injuries were 3.0, 0.83, and 0.69 ng\/ml. In total, primary mortality was observed in 18 (9.7%) patients, while secondary causes were attributable in 20 (12.3%) patients. Regression analysis for primarily CNS cause of mortality showed PCT cutoff level at admission more than 5.5 ng\/ml carried sensitivity and specificity of 75%, but for secondary cause (sepsis) of mortality, PCT cutoff values on day 2 > 1.15 ng\/ml were derived significant with sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 66%. No significant association of parameters like length of ICU stay, Glasgow outcome scale (GOS), and primary\/secondary mortality with the presence of extracranial injuries in TBI patients as compared with TBI alone was noted. CONCLUSION: This observational study demonstrates the poor correlation between PCT concentrations with outcome at days 1, 2, and 5 post-injury. The predicted relationship between PCT levels and outcome was not confirmed, and that these results do not support the prognostic utility of PCT biomarker in this population for outcome (mortality) assessment in TBI patients with or without extracranial injuries.",

On the other hand, inadequate and asynchronous spontaneous breathing has the potential to aggravate lung injury. During use of airway-pressure-release-ventilation (APRV), the assisted breaths are difficult to measure. We developed an algorithm to differentiate the breaths in a setting of lung injury in spontaneously breathing ewes. We hypothesized that differentiation of breaths into spontaneous, mechanical and assisted is feasible using a specially developed for this purpose algorithm. Ventilation parameters were recorded by software that integrated ventilator output variables. The flow signal, measured by the EVITA\u00ae XL (L\u00fcbeck, Germany), was measured every 2 ms by a custom Java-based computerized algorithm (Breath-Sep). By integrating the flow signal, tidal volume (V(T)) of each breath was calculated. By using the flow curve the algorithm separated the different breaths and numbered them for each time point. Breaths were separated into mechanical, assisted and spontaneous. Bland Altman analysis was used to compare parameters. Comparing the values calculated by Breath-Sep with the data from the EVITA\u00ae using Bland\u2013Altman analyses showed a mean bias of \u2212 2.85% and 95% limits of agreement from \u2212 25.76 to 20.06% for MV(total). For respiratory rate (RR) RR(set) a bias of 0.84% with a SD of 1.21% and 95% limits of agreement from \u2212 1.53 to 3.21% were found. In the cluster analysis of the 25th highest breaths of each group RR(total) was higher using the EVITA\u00ae. In the mechanical subgroup the values for RR(spont) and MV(spont) the EVITA\u00ae showed higher values compared to Breath-Sep.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on the impact of a specialized extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) team on clinical outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicated by cardiogenic shock (CS). This study evaluated whether specialized ECMO team is associated with improved in-hospital mortality in AMI patients undergoing veno-arterial (VA) ECMO. METHODS: A total of 255 AMI patients who underwent VA-ECMO were included. In January 2014, a multidisciplinary ECMO team was founded at our institution. Eligible patients were classified into a pre-ECMO team group (n = 131) and a post-ECMO team group (n = 124). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: In-hospital mortality (pre-ECMO team vs. post-ECMO team, 54.2% vs. 33.9%; p = 0.002) and cardiac intensive care unit mortality (pre-ECMO team vs. post-ECMO team, 51.9% vs. 30.6%; p = 0.001) were significantly lower after the implementation of a multidisciplinary ECMO team. On multivariable logistic regression model, implementation of the multidisciplinary ECMO team was associated with reduction of in-hospital mortality [odds ratio: 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20\u20130.67; p = 0.001]. Incidence of all-cause mortality [58.3% vs. 35.2%; hazard ratio (HR): 0.49, 95% CI 0.34\u20130.72; p < 0.001) and readmission due to heart failure (28.2% vs. 6.4%; HR: 0.21, 95% CI 0.08\u20130.58; p = 0.003) at 6 months of follow-up were also significantly lower in the post-ECMO team group than in the pre-ECMO team group. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a multidisciplinary ECMO team was associated with improved clinical outcomes in AMI patients complicated by CS. Our data support that a specialized ECMO team is indispensable for improving outcomes in patients with AMI complicated by CS.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and outcomes of early surgical ligation in preterm neonates with hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (HSPDA) and to investigate predictors for surgical treatment after unsuccessful medical management. METHODS: Medical records from the neonatal intensive care unit of Hanyang University Seoul Hospital from January 2010 to December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. 233 preterm neonates weighing less than 1500g with HSPDA were enrolled in our study. Of these preterm neonates, 134 underwent surgical ligation and were subdivided into the early ligation group (n = 49; within 10 days of age) and the late ligation group (n = 85; after 10 days of age). RESULTS: The mean gestational age and birth weight were significantly lower in the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) ligation group than in the Non-ligation group (p < 0.001). PDA ductal diameter > 2.0 mm (p < 0.001), low Apgar score at 5 min (p = 0.033), and chorioamnionitis (p = 0.037) were the predictors for receiving surgical treatment for PDA. Early ligation was significantly associated with a low incidence of culture-proven sepsis (p = 0.004), mechanical ventilator time > 4 weeks (p = 0.007), necrotizing enterocolitis stage (NEC) \u2265 III (p = 0.022), and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) grade \u2265 III (p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Early surgical ligation minimizes the adverse effects of HSPDA in predicted preterm neonates who subsequently require surgical treatment for PDA. This result suggests that in preterm neonates weighing less than 1500g with HSPDA that is unresponsive to medical treatment, delayed ductal closure should be avoided to reduce severe NEC, severe IVH, culture-proven sepsis, and facilitate earlier endotracheal extubation.",

We sought to determine whether an evidence-based, goal-directed checklist for donor management in intensive care units (ICUs) can reduce donor losses to cardiac arrest. METHODS\/DESIGN: The DONORS study is a multicentre, cluster-randomised controlled trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio designed to compare an intervention group (goal-directed checklist for brain-dead potential organ donor management) with a control group (standard ICU care). The primary outcome is loss of potential donors due to cardiac arrest. Secondary outcomes are the number of actual organ donors and the number of solid organs recovered per actual donor. Exploratory outcomes include the achievement of relevant clinical goals during the management of brain-dead potential organ donors. The present statistical analysis plan (SAP) describes all primary statistical procedures that will be used to evaluate the results and perform exploratory and sensitivity analyses of the trial. DISCUSSION: The SAP of the DONORS study aims to describe its analytic procedures, enhancing the transparency of the study.

        "doi": "10.1007\/s12028-020-01004-3",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Intracranial compliance refers to the relationship between a change in intracranial volume and the resultant change in intracranial pressure (ICP). Measurement of compliance is useful in managing cardiovascular and respiratory failure; however, there are no contemporary means to assess intracranial compliance. Knowledge of intracranial compliance could complement ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) monitoring in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and may enable a proactive approach to ICP management. In this proof-of-concept study, we aimed to capitalize on the physiologic principles of intracranial compliance and vascular reactivity to CO(2), and standard-of-care neurocritical care monitoring, to develop a method to assess dynamic intracranial compliance. METHODS: Continuous ICP and end-tidal CO(2) (ETCO(2)) data from children with severe TBI were collected after obtaining informed consent in this Institutional Review Board-approved study. An intracranial pressure-PCO(2) Compliance Index (PCI) was derived by calculating the moment-to-moment correlation between change in ICP and change in ETCO(2). As such, \u201cgood\u201d compliance may be reflected by a lack of correlation between time-synched changes in ICP in response to changes in ETCO(2), and \u201cpoor\u201d compliance may be reflected by a positive correlation between changes in ICP in response to changes in ETCO(2). RESULTS: A total of 978 h of ICP and ETCO(2) data were collected and analyzed from eight patients with severe TBI. Demographic and clinical characteristics included patient age 7.1 \u00b1 5.8 years (mean \u00b1 SD); 6\/8 male; initial Glasgow Coma Scale score 3 [3\u20137] (median [IQR]); 6\/8 had decompressive surgery; 7.1 \u00b1 1.4 ICP monitor days; ICU length of stay (LOS) 16.1 \u00b1 6.8 days; hospital LOS 25.9 \u00b1 8.4 days; and survival 100%. The mean PCI for all patients throughout the monitoring period was 0.18 \u00b1 0.04, where mean ICP was 13.7 \u00b1 2.1 mmHg. In this cohort, PCI was observed to be consistently above 0.18 by 12 h after monitor placement. Percent time spent with PCI thresholds > 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 were 62% [24], 38% [14], and 23% [15], respectively. The percentage of time spent with an ICP threshold > 20 mmHg was 5.1% [14.6]. CONCLUSIONS: Indirect assessment of dynamic intracranial compliance in TBI patients using standard-of-care monitoring appears feasible and suggests a prolonged period of derangement out to 5 days post-injury. Further study is ongoing to determine if the PCI\u2014a new physiologic index, complements utility of ICP and\/or CPP in guiding management of patients with severe TBI.

This study investigated the association between ScO(2) and postoperative outcome by investigating both baseline ScO(2) values and intraoperative desaturations from baseline. METHODS: All CCS procedures performed in the period 2010-2017 in our institution in which ScO(2) was monitored were included in this historical cohort study. Baseline ScO(2) was determined after tracheal intubation, before surgical incision. Subgroups were based on cardiac pathology and degree of intracardiac shunting. Poor outcome was defined based on length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU)\/hospital, duration of mechanical ventilation (MV), and 30-day mortality. Intraoperatively, ScO(2) total time below baseline (TBBL) and ScO(2) time-weighted average (TWA) were calculated. RESULTS: Data from 565 patients were analyzed. Baseline ScO(2) was significantly associated with LOS in ICU (odds ratio [OR] per percentage decrease in baseline ScO(2), 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93 to 0.97; P < 0.001), with LOS in hospital (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.96; P < 0.001), with MV duration (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.90 to 0.95; P < 0.001) and with 30-day mortality (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.98; P = 0.007). Cerebral oxygen saturation TWA had no associations, while ScO(2) TBBL had only a small association with LOS in ICU (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.03; P < 0.001), MV duration (OR,1.02; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.03; P = 0.002), and LOS in hospital (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.04; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery, low baseline ScO(2) values measured after tracheal intubation were associated with several adverse postoperative outcomes. In contrast, the severity of actual intraoperative cerebral desaturation was not associated with postoperative outcomes. Baseline ScO(2) measured after tracheal intubation may help identify patients at increased perioperative risk.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Redo isolated tricuspid valve surgery is associated with a high morbidity and mortality, and its optimal timing remains controversial. Hence, here we reviewed the early and midterm results of simplified, minimally invasive, beating-heart technique for redo isolated tricuspid valve surgery in patients at high risk. METHODS: A total of 32 consecutive patients underwent a redo isolated tricuspid valve surgery using minimally invasive, beating-heart technique through a right lateral thoracotomy in our center between June 2016 and April 2020. The mean age of patients was 57.4 \u00b1 8.3 years, and 18 patients (56.3%) were women. The mean preoperative EuroSCORE was 7.8 \u00b1 1.4 (range: 6\u201311). Follow-up was 87.1% complete, with a mean duration of 26.3 \u00b1 12.3 months. RESULTS: Both in-hospital and 30-day mortalities were 3.1%. Tricuspid valve replacement with bioprosthesis was performed in 30 patients (93.8%), and the remaining two patients (6.2%) underwent tricuspid repair (annuloplasty and leaflet reconstruction). The mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 81.5 \u00b1 29.0 min. The overall in-hospital duration and intensive care unit (ICU) times were 13.6 \u00b1 7.6 days and 4.1 \u00b1 2.8 days, respectively. Postoperative complications included prolonged ventilation in six patients (18.8%), acute kidney injury in three patients (9.4%), and neurologic event, wound infection, or permanent third-degree atrioventricular block, in one patient (3.1%) each.

METHODS: In this descriptive comparative study, 60 patients were selected trough convenience sampling. After insertion of the NG tube in a standard method, the accuracy of placement of the tube with both epigastric auscultation and capnography was investigated. The NG tube insertion accuracy was then confirmed via radiography. Data analysis was performed using statistical software SPSS version 23. RESULTS: The result showed that capnography had a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100, 92.5, and 95% respectively, but epigastric auscultation had 90, 80, and 83.4% respectively. The Kappa agreement coefficient between two methods was \u2212 0.759.

This study aimed to compare the short-term oxygenation and long-term mortality based on cannula configuration in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who receive VV-ECMO, especially in the absence of newly developed dual-lumen, single cannula. METHODS: Data of patients with severe ARDS who received VV-ECMO from 2012 to 2015 at six hospitals were retrospectively analyzed. Primary outcomes were the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2)) at 1, 4, and 12 h after ECMO initiation and 180-day mortality. RESULTS: Patients (n = 335) were divided into two groups based on the return cannula site: femoral vein (n = 178) or internal jugular vein (n = 157). The propensity score matching analysis generated 90 pairs, and baseline characteristics at admission, including PaO(2), were similar between the groups. PaO(2) at 1, 4 and 12 h after ECMO initiation were not different according to cannula configuration. Moreover, the increment in oxygenation from the baseline values was not different between the femoral and jugular group. PaCO(2) level at 1, 4 and 12 h were significantly lower in the jugular group. The two groups did not differ in terms of mortality at 180 days after ECMO, however more cannula-related complications occurred in the jugular group. CONCLUSION: Regardless of the cannula configuration, patients with ARDS managed with VV-ECMO showed comparable clinical outcomes in terms of short-term oxygenation and long-term mortality.

However, the optimal respiratory support method is still under debate. This network meta-analysis (NMA) aims to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of various respiratory support methods used for preventive purposes after scheduled extubation in critically ill medical patients. METHODS: A systematic database search was performed from inception to December 19, 2019, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a preventive use of different respiratory support methods, including conventional oxygen therapy (COT), noninvasive ventilation (NIV), high-flow oxygen therapy (HFOT), and combinational use of HFOT and NIV (HFOT+NIV), after planned extubation in adult critically ill medical patients. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessments were performed in duplicate. The primary outcomes included re-intubation rate and short-term mortality. RESULTS: Seventeen RCTs comprising 3341 participants with 4 comparisons were included. Compared with COT, NIV significantly reduced the re-intubation rate [risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.77; moderate quality of evidence] and short-term mortality (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.91; moderate quality of evidence). Compared to COT, HFOT had a beneficial effect on the re-intubation rate (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.86; moderate quality of evidence) but no effect on short-term mortality (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.12; low quality of evidence). No significant difference in the re-intubation rate or short-term mortality was found among NIV, HFOT, and HFOT+NIV. The treatment rankings based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) from best to worst for re-intubation rate were HFOT+NIV (95.1%), NIV (53.4%), HFOT (51.2%), and COT (0.3%), and the rankings for short-term mortality were NIV (91.0%), HFOT (54.3%), HFOT+NIV (43.7%), and COT (11.1%). Sensitivity analyses of trials with a high risk of extubation failure for the primary outcomes indicated that the SUCRA rankings were comparable to those of the primary analysis. CONCLUSIONS: After scheduled extubation, the preventive use of NIV is probably the most effective respiratory support method for comprehensively preventing re-intubation and short-term death in critically ill medical patients, especially those with a high risk of extubation failure.",

The optimal mode of mechanical ventilation for managing PBLI is not currently known, and clinical trials in humans are impossible due to the sporadic and violent nature of the disease. METHODS: A high-fidelity multi-organ computational simulator of PBLI pathophysiology was configured to replicate data from 14 PBLI casualties from the conflict in Afghanistan. Adaptive and responsive ventilatory protocols implementing low tidal volume (LTV) ventilation and airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) were applied to each simulated patient for 24 h, allowing direct quantitative comparison of their effects on gas exchange, ventilatory parameters, haemodynamics, extravascular lung water and indices of ventilator-induced lung injury. RESULTS: The simulated patients responded well to both ventilation strategies. Post 24-h investigation period, the APRV arm had similar PF ratios (137 mmHg vs 157 mmHg), lower sub-injury threshold levels of mechanical power (11.9 J\/min vs 20.7 J\/min) and lower levels of extravascular lung water (501 ml vs 600 ml) compared to conventional LTV. Driving pressure was higher in the APRV group (11.9 cmH(2)O vs 8.6 cmH(2)O), but still significantly less than levels associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate use of APRV may offer casualties with PBLI important mortality-related benefits and should be considered for management of this challenging patient group.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Subarachnoid hemorrhage is a severe subtype of hemorrhagic stroke, and deep-vein thrombosis is a frequent complication detected in these patients. In addition to other well-established risk factors, the early activation of coagulation systems present in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage could potentially play a role in the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis. This study aims to identify possible predictors for deep-vein thrombosis related to subarachnoid hemorrhage. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on patients with a diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage who presented to our institution between 1 January 2014 and 1 August 2018. We reviewed electronic medical records and analyzed several parameters such as Fisher scale, World Federation of Neurosurgical Surgeons scale, aneurysm site, surgical or endovascular treatment, decompressive craniectomy, vasospasm, infection (meningitis and pneumonia), presence of motor deficit, length of stay in the ICU, length of hospital stay, number of days under ventilator support, d-dimer at hospitalization, and the time to thromboprophylaxis (days). RESULTS: The univariate analysis showed that intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhage, d-dimer at hospitalization, the time to thromboprophylaxis, motor deficit, and aneurysm located at the internal carotid artery were statistically significant factors. Intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhage (OR 2,78 95%CI 1.07\u20137.12), motor deficit (OR 3.46; 95%CI 1.37\u20139.31), and d-dimer at hospitalization (OR 1.002 95% CI 1.001\u20131.003) were demonstrated as independent risk factors for deep-vein thrombosis. Length of hospital stay was also found to be significantly longer in patients who developed deep-vein thrombosis (p value 0.018). CONCLUSION: Elevated d-dimer level at the time of hospitalization, motor deficit, and the presence of an intraparenchymal hemorrhage are independent risk factors for deep-vein thrombosis. Patients with DVT also had a significantly longer hospital stay. Even though further studies are needed, patients with elevated d-dimer at hospitalization and intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhage may benefit from a more aggressive screening strategy for deep-vein thrombosis.",

OBJECTIVES: Describing the respiratory complications and their predictive factors in patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injuries at C5\u2013T5 level during the initial hospitalization. SETTING: Hospital Vall d\u2019Hebron, Barcelona. METHODS: Data from patients admitted in a reference unit with acute traumatic injuries involving levels C5\u2013T5. Respiratory complications were defined as: acute respiratory failure, respiratory infection, atelectasis, non-hemothorax pleural effusion, pulmonary embolism or haemoptysis. Candidate predictors of these complications were demographic data, comorbidity, smoking, history of respiratory disease, the spinal cord injury characteristics (level and ASIA Impairment Scale) and thoracic trauma. A logistic regression model was created to determine associations between potential predictors and respiratory complications. RESULTS: We studied 174 patients with an age of 47.9 (19.7) years, mostly men (87%), with low comorbidity. Coexistent thoracic trauma was found in 24 (19%) patients with cervical and 35 (75%) with thoracic injuries (p < 0.001). Respiratory complications were frequent (53%) and were associated to longer hospital stay: 83.1 (61.3) and 45.3 (28.1) days in patients with and without respiratory complications (p < 0.001). The strongest predictors of respiratory complications were: previous respiratory disease (OR 5.4, 95% CI: 1.5\u201319.2), complete motor function impairment (AIS A\u2013B) (OR 4.7, 95% CI: 2.4\u20139.5) and concurrent chest trauma (OR 3.73, 95% CI: 1.8\u20137.9). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory complications are common in traumatic spinal cord injuries between C5\u2013T5. We identified previous respiratory disease, complete motor function impairment and the coexistence of thoracic trauma as predictors of respiratory complications.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: 1) To successfully implement early mobilization of individuals with prolonged mechanical ventilation in multiple ICUs at a tertiary care hospital and 2) to reduce length of stay and improve quality of care to individuals in the ICUs. DESIGN: Comparative effectiveness cohort study based on a quality improvement project. SETTING: Five ICUs at a tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 541 mechanically ventilated patients over a 2-year period (2014\u20132015): 280 and 261, respectively. Age ranged from 19 to 94 years (mean, 63.84; sd, 14.96). INTERVENTIONS: A hospital-based initiative spurred development of a multidisciplinary team, tasked with establishing early mobilization in ICUs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Early mobilization in the ICUs was evaluated by the number of physical therapy consults, length of stay, individual treatment sessions utilizing functional outcomes, and follow-up visits. Implementation of an early mobilization protocol across all ICUs led to a significant increase in the number of physical therapy consults, a significant decrease in ICU and overall lengths of stay, significantly shorter days to implement physical therapy, and a significantly higher physical therapy follow-up rate. CONCLUSIONS: Mobilizing individuals in an intensive care setting decreases length of stay and hospital costs. With an interdisciplinary team to plan, implement, and evaluate stages of the program, a successful early mobilization program can be implemented across all ICUs simultaneously and affect change in patients who will require prolonged mechanical ventilation.",

DESIGN: A retrospective observational cohort study. PATIENTS: Surgical and cardiovascular patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy during a 2-year period from December 2016 to November 2018. SETTING: Two ICUs at a single academic medical center. INTERVENTION: Physical mobility and ambulation while on continuous renal replacement therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Therapy data including ICU Mobility Scale score, number of physical therapy sessions with and without ambulation and gait distance, along with safety data including filter life, safety events, and mortality were analyzed. The cohort of patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy during the 2-year period was 206. Of these, 172 (83.49%) received simultaneous physical therapy. The median ICU Mobility Scale was 5 (interquartile range, 4\u20137) over a total of 1,517 physical therapy sessions. Ambulation with concomitant continuous renal replacement therapy connected was achieved in 78 patients (37.86%). There were 377 ambulation sessions (24.85% of all sessions) with a mean of 4.83 (sds 4.94) ambulation sessions per ambulatory patient. Patients walked an average of 888.53 feet (sd 1,365.50) while on continuous renal replacement therapy and a daily average of 150.61 feet (sd 133.50). In-hospital mortality was lowest for patients who ambulated (17.95%) and highest for patients who received no therapy (73.53%). Continuous renal replacement therapy filter life was longest for patients who ambulated (2,047.20 min [sd 1,086.50 min]), and shortest in patients who received no therapy (1,682.20 min [sd 1,343.80 min]). One safety event was reported during this time (0.0007% of all physical therapy sessions). CONCLUSIONS: Ambulation while on continuous renal replacement therapy was not associated with an increased risk of safety events and was feasible with the use of nonfemoral catheters and dialysis equipment with internal batteries.",

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary care teaching hospital in Boston, MA. PATIENTS: All patients over 18 years old admitted to the medical, surgical, or cardiac ICUs from 2013 to 2016, and who received cisatracurium for at least 24 hours. INTERVENTIONS: We examined patients for whom sedation was decreased despite accompanying ongoing neuromuscular blockade administration. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 300 patients who met inclusion criteria (39% female, mean age of 57 yr old), 168 (56%) had sedation down-titrated while receiving neuromuscular blockade with a mean decrease in sedation dose of 18.7%. Factors associated with down-titration of sedation were bispectral index usage (90\/168 [53.6%] vs 50\/168 [29.8%] patients; p < 0.01; odds ratio, 1.82; 1.12\u20132.94), and bolus dose of neuromuscular blockade prior to continuous infusion (138\/168 [82.1%] vs 79\/168 [47.0%] patients; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Down-titration of sedation among mechanically ventilated patients receiving neuromuscular blockade was common and was correlated with bispectral index monitor usage. Clinicians should be aware of the limitations of quantitative electroencephalography monitoring devices and recognize their potential to cause inappropriate down-titration of sedation. Substantial opportunity exists to improve the quality of care of patients receiving neuromuscular blockade through development of guidelines and standardized care pathways.",

Significant aspects of management in the intensive care unit (ICU) during the later course of aSAH such as ventilation and sedation (VST) remain unaddressed. aSAH patients present unique challenges not accounted for in general ICU recommendations and guidelines, which is why we attempted to further characterize ICU practices in aSAH patients in Germany. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide survey on ICU practices in aSAH in Germany. Secondarily, we assessed the existence of and compliance with current guidelines regarding ICU practices. The questionnaire was designed in interdisciplinary fashion and distributed online through the kwiksurvey(\u00ae) platform (Bristol, UK). RESULTS: A total of 50 responses were received, accounting for a response rate of 49%. Twenty-one were university hospitals (UH), 23 high-volume centers (HVC), 6 low-volume centers (LVC). Half of the participating centers do not take into consideration WFNS at presentation to indicate ventilation. While 42% of centers rely on the P\/F ratio to indicate ventilation, 62% of them have a cutoff value of < 200, and 38% of < 100. While most UH and HVC used propofol for the first phase of sedation (95%), LVC employed benzodiazepines (100%). Sedation deepening was done with ketamine in UH (75%) and HVC (60%), whereas LVC used predominantly clonidine (100%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study clearly demonstrates that attitudes and practices pertaining to ICU management in aSAH are enormously heterogeneous, reflecting the lack of good quality evidence and differing interpretations thereof.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Trauma team activation (TTA) criteria trigger early mobilization of resources for the sickest trauma patients. Patients with moderately depressed GCS who do not trigger the highest level activation are at risk for adverse outcomes, potentially from delayed time to intervention. The study objective was to define the impact of time to first CT Head (CTH) on outcomes among blunt trauma patients with moderately depressed GCS. METHODS: Patients from the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) databank (2013\u20132016) with first ED GCS 9\u201312 were included. Transfers, penetrating mechanisms, death < 24 h, AIS = 6 in any body region, and patients with severe associated injuries were excluded. Study groups were defined by time to first CTH after ED arrival: immediate (\u2264 1 h) vs. delayed (1\u20136 h). Primary outcomes were time to neurosurgical intervention and time to ED discharge. RESULTS: After exclusions, 4997 patients were identified. Of these, 79% (n = 3,954) underwent immediate CTH and 21% (n = 1,043) had delayed CTH. Median GCS was 11 [10\u201312] in both groups and there was no difference in median Head AIS (4 [3\u20134] vs. 4 [3\u20134], p = 0.586). Time to craniotomy and ICP monitor insertion were longer in the delayed group (4.2 h [3.0\u20137.6] vs. 3.1 h [2.1\u20138.7], p = 0.001; and 5.7 h [3.8\u201313.0] vs. 4.4 h [2.6\u201312.0], p = 0.008), as was time in the ED (4.3 h [2.7\u20136.5] vs. 2.1 h [1.2\u20133.7], p < 0.001). There was no difference in need for craniotomy (11% vs. 10%, p = 0.287), need for ICP monitor (12% vs. 12%, p = 0.899), or mortality (11% vs. 9%, p = 0.160). On multivariate analysis, age > 65 (OR 2.813, p < 0.001), SBP < 90 mmHg (OR 2.934, p < 0.001), ED intubation (OR 1.486, p = 0.001), and Head AIS scores of 4 (OR 1.884, p < 0.001) and 5 (OR 6.729, p < 0.001) were independently associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate CTH for blunt trauma patients with moderately depressed GCS decreases time to intervention and reduces ED time. A protocol to shorten time to CTH may be beneficial for both patients and hospitals.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Continuous monitoring of SpO(2) in the neonatal ICU is the standard of care. Changes in SpO(2) exposure have been shown to markedly impact outcome, but limiting extreme episodes is an arduous task. Much more complicated than setting alarm policy, it is fraught with balancing alarm fatigue and compliance. Information on optimum strategies is limited. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study intended to describe the relative chance of normoxemia, and risks of hypoxemia and hyperoxemia at relevant SpO(2) levels in the neonatal ICU. The data, paired SpO(2)-PaO(2) and post-menstrual age, are from a single tertiary care unit. They reflect all infants receiving supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation during a 3-year period. The primary measures were the chance of normoxemia (PaO(2) 50\u201380 mmHg), risks of severe hypoxemia (PaO(2) \u2264 40 mmHg), and of severe hyperoxemia (PaO(2) \u2265 100 mmHg) at relevant SpO(2) levels. RESULTS: Neonates were categorized by postmenstrual age: < 33 (n = 155), 33\u201336 (n = 192) and > 36 (n = 1031) weeks. From these infants, 26,162 SpO(2)-PaO(2) pairs were evaluated. The post-menstrual weeks (median and IQR) of the three groups were: 26 (24\u201328) n = 2603; 34 (33\u201335) n = 2501; and 38 (37\u201339) n = 21,058. The chance of normoxemia (65, 95%-CI 64\u201367%) was similar across the SpO(2) range of 88\u201395%, and independent of PMA. The increasing risk of severe hypoxemia became marked at a SpO(2) of 85% (25, 95%-CI 21\u201329%), and was independent of PMA. The risk of severe hyperoxemia was dependent on PMA. For infants < 33 weeks it was marked at 98% SpO(2) (25, 95%-CI 18\u201333%), for infants 33\u201336 weeks at 97% SpO(2) (24, 95%-CI 14\u201325%) and for those > 36 weeks at 96% SpO(2) (20, 95%-CI 17\u201322%). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of hyperoxemia and hypoxemia increases exponentially as SpO(2) moves towards extremes. Postmenstrual age influences the threshold at which the risk of hyperoxemia became pronounced, but not the thresholds of hypoxemia or normoxemia. The thresholds at which a marked change in the risk of hyperoxemia and hypoxemia occur can be used to guide the setting of alarm thresholds. Optimal management of neonatal oxygen saturation must take into account concerns of alarm fatigue, staffing levels, and FiO(2) titration practices.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients (26 SCI, 25 TBI) who admitted to the rehabilitation clinic from the ICU included in this study. All demographic data were recorded. All participants underwent diaphragmatic ultrasonography evaluation before and after 12 weeks of neurologic rehabilitation program. The diaphragm thickness and outcome parameters were compared in all patient groups and in each patient subgroups. Evaluation parameters of patients before and after treatment were compared in patient subgroups. RESULTS: Diaphragm atrophy was found in 14 patients (64%) in TBI group and 12 patients (46%) in SCI group. The diaphragm thickness negatively correlated with the ICU length of stay and positively correlated with the before\/after rehabilitation functional scores and the change in functional independence measure scores (p < 0.05). According to the regression analysis; the change in functional independence measure scores was found to be affected by the diaphragm thickness (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The diaphragm thickness may be an effective factor on the rehabilitation process.",

The use of propofol was not found to be associated with an increased incidence of oxygenator failure when compared with cohorts who did not receive propofol (21% propofol arm vs. 6% control, p = 0.13). When analyzed for anticoagulation omission effects, propofol did not increase the risk of oxygenator failure (p = 0.63). The only predictor that statistically predicted the risk of oxygenator failure was development of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) during ECMO.

Sixty-eight institutions declared to have capacities with a broad distribution across Germany and its federal states.

For most \u201cbeds\u201d included in this analysis a basic validation was possible. While a reasonable coverage of these specialized service capacities by the survey is likely, the number reported could still be biased by underreporting by non-response.

        "doi": "10.1007\/s10877-020-00552-5",
        "abstract": "Pressure support ventilation (PSV) should be titrated considering the pressure developed by the respiratory muscles (P(musc)) to prevent under- and over-assistance. The esophageal pressure (P(es)) is the clinical gold standard for P(musc) assessment, but its use is limited by alleged invasiveness and complexity. The least square fitting method and the end-inspiratory occlusion method have been proposed as non-invasive alternatives for P(musc) assessment. The aims of this study were: (1) to compare the accuracy of P(musc) estimation using the end-inspiration occlusion (P(musc,index)) and the least square fitting (P(musc,lsf)) against the reference method based on P(es); (2) to test the accuracy of P(musc,lsf) and of P(musc,index) to detect overassistance, defined as P(musc) \u2264 1 cmH(2)O. We studied 18 patients at three different PSV levels. At each PSV level, P(musc), P(musc,lsf), P(musc,index) were calculated on the same breaths. Differences among P(musc), P(musc,lsf), P(musc,index) were analyzed with linear mixed effects models. Bias and agreement were assessed by Bland\u2013Altman analysis for repeated measures. The ability of P(musc,lsf) and P(musc,index) to detect overassistance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. Positive and negative predictive values were calculated using cutoff values that maximized the sum of sensitivity and specificity. At each PSV level, P(musc,lsf) was not different from P(musc) (p = 0.96), whereas P(musc,index) was significantly lower than P(musc). The bias between P(musc) and P(musc,lsf) was zero, whereas P(musc,index) systematically underestimated P(musc) of 6 cmH(2)O. The limits of agreement between P(musc) and P(musc,lsf) and between P(musc) and P(musc,index) were \u00b1 12 cmH(2)O across bias. Both P(musc,lsf) \u2264 4 cmH(2)O and P(musc,index) \u2264 1 cmH(2)O had excellent negative predictive value [0.98 (95% CI 0.94\u20131) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.91\u20130.99), respectively)] to identify over-assistance. The inspiratory effort during PSV could not be accurately estimated by the least square fitting or end-inspiratory occlusion method because the limits of agreement were far above the signal size. These non-invasive approaches, however, could be used to screen patients at risk for absent or minimal respiratory muscles activation to prevent the ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are associated with high in-hospital mortality. However, in cohorts of ARDS patients from the 1990s, patients more commonly died from sepsis or multi-organ failure rather than refractory hypoxemia. Given increased attention to lung-protective ventilation and sepsis treatment in the past 25 years, we hypothesized that causes of death may be different among contemporary cohorts. These differences may provide clinicians with insight into targets for future therapeutic interventions. METHODS: We identified adult patients hospitalized at a single tertiary care center (2016\u20132017) with AHRF, defined as PaO(2)\/FiO(2) \u2264 300 while receiving invasive mechanical ventilation for > 12 h, who died during hospitalization. ARDS was adjudicated by multiple physicians using the Berlin definition. Separate abstractors blinded to ARDS status collected data on organ dysfunction and withdrawal of life support using a standardized tool. The primary cause of death was defined as the organ system that most directly contributed to death or withdrawal of life support. RESULTS: We identified 385 decedents with AHRF, of whom 127 (33%) had ARDS. The most common primary causes of death were sepsis (26%), pulmonary dysfunction (22%), and neurologic dysfunction (19%). Multi-organ failure was present in 70% at time of death, most commonly due to sepsis (50% of all patients), and 70% were on significant respiratory support at the time of death. Only 2% of patients had insupportable oxygenation or ventilation. Eighty-five percent died following withdrawal of life support. Patients with ARDS more often had pulmonary dysfunction as the primary cause of death (28% vs 19%; p = 0.04) and were also more likely to die while requiring significant respiratory support (82% vs 64%; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this contemporary cohort of patients with AHRF, the most common primary causes of death were sepsis and pulmonary dysfunction, but few patients had insupportable oxygenation or ventilation. The vast majority of deaths occurred after withdrawal of life support. ARDS patients were more likely to have pulmonary dysfunction as the primary cause of death and die while requiring significant respiratory support compared to patients without ARDS.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obese patients undergoing general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation during laparoscopic abdominal surgery commonly have a higher incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs), due to factors such as decreasing oxygen reserve, declining functional residual capacity, and reducing lung compliance. Pulmonary atelectasis caused by pneumoperitoneum and mechanical ventilation is further aggravated in obese patients. Recent studies demonstrated that individualized positive end-expiratory pressure (iPEEP) was one of effective lung-protective ventilation strategies. However, there is still no exact method to determine the best iPEEP, especially for obese patients. Here, we will use the best static lung compliance (Cstat) method to determine iPEEP, compared with regular PEEP, by observing the atelectasis area measured by electrical impedance tomography (EIT), and try to prove a better iPEEP setting method for obese patients. METHODS: This study is a single-center, two-arm, prospective, randomized control trial. A total number of 80 obese patients with body mass index \u2265 32.5 kg\/m(2) scheduled for laparoscopic gastric volume reduction and at medium to high risk for PPCs will be enrolled. They will be randomly assigned to control group (PEEP5 group) and iPEEP group. A PEEP of 5 cmH(2)O will be used in PEEP5 group, whereas an individualized PEEP value determined by a Cstat-directed PEEP titration procedure will be applied in the iPEEP group. Standard lung-protective ventilation methods such as low tidal volumes (7 ml\/kg, predicted body weight, PBW), a fraction of inspired oxygen \u2265 0.5, and recruitment maneuvers (RM) will be applied during and after operation in both groups. Primary endpoints will be postoperative atelectasis measured by chest electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and intraoperative oxygen index. Secondary endpoints will be serum IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, procalcitonin (PCT) kinetics during and after surgery, incidence of PPCs, organ dysfunction, length of in-hospital stay, and hospital expense. DISCUSSION: Although there are several studies about the effect of iPEEP titration on perioperative PPCs in obese patients recently, the iPEEP setting method they used was complex and was not always feasible in routine clinical practice. This trial will assess a possible simple method to determine individualized optimal PEEP in obese patients and try to demonstrate that individualized PEEP with lung-protective ventilation methods is necessary for obese patients undergoing general surgery. The results of this trial will support anesthesiologist a feasible Cstat-directed PEEP titration method during anesthesia for obese patients in attempt to prevent PPCs.

Uncertainty persists as to whether hyperoxia is benign in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly in regard to their long-term functional neurological outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study of invasively ventilated patients with TBI admitted to the ICU. A database linkage between the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Database (ANZICS-APD) and the Victorian State Trauma Registry (VSTR) was utilized. The primary exposure variable was minimum acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) III P(a)O(2) in the first 24 h of ICU. We defined hypoxia as P(a)O(2) < 60 mmHg, normoxia as 60\u2013299 mmHg, and hyperoxia as \u2265 300 mmHg. The primary outcome was a Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) < 5 at 6 months while secondary outcomes included 12 and 24 months GOSE and mortality at each of these timepoints. Additional sensitivity analyses were undertaken in the following subgroups: isolated head injury, patients with operative intervention, head injury severity, and P(a)O(2) either subcategorized by increments of 60 mmHg or treated as a continuous variable. RESULTS: A total of 3699 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 42.8 years, 77.7% were male and the mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) III score was 60.1 (26.3). 2842 patients experienced normoxia, and 783 hyperoxia. The primary outcome occurred in 1470 (47.1%) of patients overall with 1123 (47.1%) from the normoxia group and 312 (45.9%) from the hyperoxia group\u2014odds ratio 0.99 (0.78\u20131.25). No significant differences in outcomes between groups at 6, 12, and 24 months were observed. Sensitivity analyses did not identify subgroups that were adversely affected by exposure to hyperoxia.

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of patient-ventilator interaction comparing NAVA with pressure support ventilation (PSV) in patients difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation after moderate pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS). METHODS: In this physiological crossover study, 12 patients admitted in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) with moderate PARDS failing up to 3 spontaneous breathing trials in less than 7 days, were enrolled. Patients underwent three study conditions lasting 1 h each: PSV1, NAVA and PSV2. RESULTS: The Asynchrony Index (AI) was significantly reduced during the NAVA trial compared to both the PSV1 and PSV2 trials (p = 0.001). During the NAVA trial, the inspiratory and expiratory trigger delays were significantly shorter compared to those obtained during PSV1 and PSV2 trials (Delay(trinsp)p < 0.001, Delay(trexp)p = 0.013). These results explain the significantly longer Time(sync) observed during the NAVA trial (p < 0.001). In terms of gas exchanges, PaO(2) value significantly improved in the NAVA trial with respect to the PSV trials (p < 0.02). The PaO(2)\/FiO(2) ratio showed a significant improvement during the NAVA trial compared to both the PSV1 and PSV2 trials (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: In this specific PICU population, presenting difficulty in weaning after PARDS, NAVA was associated with a reduction of the AI and a significant improvement in oxygenation compared to PSV mode.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prone positioning (PP) has shown to improve survival in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To this point, it is unclear if PP is also beneficial for ARDS patients treated with veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) support. METHODS: We report retrospective data of a single-centre registry of patients with severe ARDS requiring VV ECMO support between October 2010 and May 2018. Patients were allocated to the PP group if PP was performed during VV ECMO treatment or the supine positioning group. VV ECMO weaning success and hospital survival were analysed before and after propensity score matching. RESULTS: A total of 158 patients could be analysed, and 38 patients (24.1%) received PP. There were no significant differences in VV ECMO weaning rate (47.4% vs. 46.7%, p = 0.94) and hospital survival (36.8% vs. 36.7%, p = 0.98) between the prone and supine groups, respectively. The analysis of 38 propensity score matched pairs also showed no difference in hospital survival (36.8% vs. 36.8%, p = 1.0) or VV ECMO weaning rate (47.4% vs. 44.7%, p = 0.82). Hospital survival was superior in the subgroup of patients treated with early PP (cutoff < 17 h via Youden\u2019s Index) as compared to late or no PP (81.8% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: In this propensity score matched cohort of severe ARDS patients requiring VV ECMO support, prone positioning at any time was not associated with improved weaning or survival.

A main preoperative feature is right ventricular failure, which represents a risk factor for postoperative low cardiac output syndrome. Levosimendan has a potentially beneficial effect. This retrospective study included consecutive GUCH patients with surgeries in a tertiary cardiothoracic centre between 01-01-2013 and 01-10-2017, to test the hypothesis that the postoperative use of levosimendan might be associated with shorter time of mechanical ventilation, when compared with the use of milrinone. To adjust for bias related to the probability of treatment assignment, it uses the inverse propensity score weighting methodology. RESULTS: Overall 363 patients had GUCH surgeries during the study period, their mean age was 31.39 \u00b1 15.31 years, 87 patients were eligible for analysis in the Levosimendan group and 117 in the Milrinone group. The propensity score used pre- and intraoperative variables and resulted in a good balance between covariates. The Levosimendan group included patients with higher preoperative risk scores, a higher prevalence of left and right ventricular failure, who required more often the addition of epinephrine, renal replacement therapy, prolonged mechanical ventilation and intensive care stay. However, after propensity score weighting, patients in the Levosimendan group had shorter durations of mechanical ventilation (average treatment effect \u2212 37.59 h IQR [\u2212 138.85 to \u2212 19.13], p = 0.01) and intensive care stay (average treatment effect \u2212 3.11 days IQR [\u2212 10.03 to \u2212 1.48], p = 0.009). The number of days of additional epinephrine support was shorter and the vasoactive inotropic scores lower. CONCLUSION: We report a beneficial effect in terms of duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care stay, and on inotropic requirements of the use of levosimendan following GUCH surgeries.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mechanical power (MP) is the energy delivered to the respiratory system over time during mechanical ventilation. Our aim was to compare the currently available methods to calculate MP during volume- and pressure-controlled ventilation, comparing different equations with the geometric reference method, to understand whether the easier to use surrogate formulas were suitable for the everyday clinical practice. This would warrant a more widespread use of mechanical power to promote lung protection. METHODS: Forty respiratory failure patients, sedated and paralyzed for clinical reasons, were ventilated in volume-controlled ventilation, at two inspiratory flows (30 and 60 L\/min), and pressure-controlled ventilation with a similar tidal volume. Mechanical power was computed both with the geometric method, as the area between the inspiratory limb of the airway pressure and the volume, and with two algebraic methods, a comprehensive and a surrogate formula. RESULTS: The bias between the MP computed by the geometric method and by the comprehensive algebraic method during volume-controlled ventilation was respectively 0.053 (0.77, \u2212 0.81) J\/min and \u2212 0.4 (0.70, \u2212 1.50) J\/min at low and high flows (r(2) = 0.96 and 0.97, p < 0.01). The MP measured and computed by the two methods were highly correlated (r(2) = 0.95 and 0.94, p < 0.01) with a bias of \u2212 0.0074 (0.91, \u2212 0.93) and \u2212 1.0 (0.45, \u2212 2.52) J\/min at high-low flows. During pressure-controlled ventilation, the bias between the MP measured and the one calculated with the comprehensive and simplified methods was correlated (r(2) = 0.81, 0.94, p < 0.01) with mean differences of \u2212 0.001 (2.05, \u2212 2.05) and \u2212 0.81 (2.11, \u2212 0.48) J\/min. CONCLUSIONS: Both for volume-controlled and pressure-controlled ventilation, the surrogate formulas approximate the reference method well enough to warrant their use in the everyday clinical practice. Given that these formulas require nothing more than the variables already displayed by the intensive care ventilator, a more widespread use of mechanical power should be encouraged to promote lung protection against ventilator-induced lung injury.",

        "abstract": "The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has led to a relative unavailability of anaesthesiological support for non-acute cardiac care. Currently, transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TF-TAVI) is predominantly performed as an elective catheterisation laboratory (cath lab) procedure. Hence, the performance of TAVI could come to a halt amidst the COVID-19 crisis. Our study population comprised 90 patients treated with TF-TAVI, with local analgesia performed by our dedicated cath lab nurses. The patients had a mean age of 80 \u00b1 5 years and 59% were male, with a predicted surgical risk of 2.2 \u00b1 0.9\/3.1 \u00b1 2.4% (Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality [STS-PROM] score\/EuroSCORE II), depicting a contemporary, lower-risk population. The composite endpoint of device success (Valve Academic Research Consortium [VARC]-2) was reached in all patients. No patients showed more than mild paravalvular leakage (3\/90, 3.3%). Overall, intravenous medication was sparsely used during the procedure, with 48 of the 90 (53%) patients receiving no unplanned intravenous medication. There was neither procedural nor in-hospital mortality. The performance of TF-TAVI using local analgesia only, managed by a dedicated nurse instead of an anaesthesiologist, was shown to be feasible and safe in a selected group of patients. This strategy may (temporarily) eliminate the need for an anaesthesiologist to be present in the cath lab and enables ongoing TAVI treatment amidst the global COVID-19 crisis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Repeat surgery of the chronically dissected aorta following repair of a Type-A acute aortic dissection (AAD) still represents a challenge. The proposed surgical options are as follows: (1) staged procedure with elephant trunk (ET) technique, (2) traditional frozen elephant trunk (FET) intervention, and (3) beating heart cerebral vessel debranching followed by thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). However, a marked enlargement of the proximal descending thoracic aorta might make it difficult to perform FET\/ET intervention. Furthermore, because in conventional surgery for AAD, a prosthetic graft replacement is generally limited to the ascending aorta, and in repeat surgery, this short Dacron graft rarely provides enough room to allow a beating heart cerebral vessel debranching and obtaining a reliable landing zone for the implantation of a firmly anchored stent graft. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all the five consecutive patients treated in our institution, between 2014 and 2017, for chronic aortic dissection after successful surgical treatment of acute Type-A aortic dissection with graft replacement limited to the ascending aorta. The five patients underwent repair utilizing a modified FET technique with total aortic arch and upper descending aorta exclusion without touching the native dissected aorta. RESULTS No early- or midterm mortality was observed. Mean time interval between the initial and the reoperative procedure was 26 months (range, 3-80 months). No patient had a minor\/major neurologic event. Mean circulatory arrest time was 16 minutes (range, 11-25 minutes). Mean follow-up time was 22 months (range, 9-42 months). CONCLUSIONS We report our initial experience with a modified FET technique realized by anastomosing the stent graft with the previously implanted ascending aortic graft in Hishimaru's zone 0 and by rerouting all cerebral vessels without \"touching\" the native chronically dissected aorta. A larger number of patients and a longer follow-up will be required to confirm these initial encouraging results.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND There is wide variation in the reported size of ruptured intracranial aneurysms and methods of size estimation. There is widespread belief that small aneurysms < 7 mm do not rupture. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to determine the size of ruptured aneurysms according to aneurysm locations and methods of size estimation. METHODS We searched PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. We included articles that reported mean aneurysm size in consecutive series of ruptured intracranial. We excluded studies limited to a specific aneurysm location or type. The random-effects model was used to calculate overall mean size and location-specific mean size. We performed meta-regression to explain observed heterogeneity and variation in reported size. RESULTS The systematic review included 36 studies and 12,609 ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Overall mean aneurysm size was 7.0 mm (95% confidence interval [CI 6.2-7.4]). Pooled mean size varied with location. Overall mean size of 2145 ruptured anterior circulation aneurysms was 6.0 mm (95% CI 5.6-6.4, residual I2 = 86%). Overall mean size of 743 ruptured posterior circulation aneurysms was 6.2 mm (95% CI 5.3-7.0, residual I2 = 93%). Meta-regression identified aneurysm location and definition of size (i.e., maximum dimension vs. aneurysm height) as significant determinants of aneurysm size reported in the studies. CONCLUSIONS The mean size of ruptured aneurysms in most studies was approximately 7 mm. The general wisdom that aneurysms of this size do not rupture is incorrect.

The PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched between June 1999 and June 2019 to identify original studies of at least 100 patients undergoing surgical repair of ruptured cerebral aneurysms and in which adverse event rates were reported. Thirty-six studies reporting adverse events in a total of 12,410 operations for repair of ruptured cerebral aneurysms were included. Surgical adverse events were common with 36 event types reported including intraoperative rupture (median rate of 16.6%), arterial injury (median rate of 3.8%) and brain swelling (median rate 5.6%). Only 6 surgical events were statistically shown to associate with poor outcomes by any author and for intraoperative rupture (the most frequently analysed), there was an even split between authors finding a statistical association with poor outcome and those finding no association. Even with modern surgical techniques, the technical demands of surgical aneurysm repair continue to lead to a high rate of intraoperative adverse events. Despite this, it is not known which of these intraoperative events are the most important contributors to the poor outcomes often seen in these patients.

METHODS We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study on consecutive cases of intracranial aneurysms treated with PED. Patient characteristics, aneurysm characteristics, and bleeding complications were analyzed. Severity of bleeding was defined according to a previously published classification defining nuisance bleeding as easy bruising, bleeding from small cuts, petechia, and ecchymosis. RESULTS 245 PED aneurysm procedures on 243 patients were retrospectively collected from three academic centers over a 4.25-year period. Sixty-seven patients (27%) had nuisance bleeds. Patients with a higher risk of nuisance bleeding were older (59.1\u00b13.4 vs . 54.7\u00b12.2, P=0.032). Patients with nuisance bleeds were more likely to have their DAPT regimen changed or dose lowered (29% vs 8.3%, P<0.001), were on DAPT for less time (10.0 months\u00b12.60 vs. 14.6 months\u00b11.95, P=0.005) and were more likely to have aneurysm occlusion at 6 months (P<0.001).

To address the disadvantages of OLV with respect to difficulties in intubation and induction, as well as the risk of respiratory complications, two-lung ventilation (TLV) with artificial pneumothorax has been introduced for use in VATS-e. However, no studies have yet compared TLV and OLV with postoperative infection and inflammation in the prone position over time postoperatively. Here, we investigated the efficacy of TLV in patients undergoing VATS-e in the prone position. METHODS Between April 2010 and December 2016, 119 patients underwent VATS-e under OLV or TLV with carbon dioxide insufflation. Clinical characteristics, surgical outcomes, and postoperative outcomes, including oxygenation and systemic inflammatory responses, were compared between patients who underwent OLV and those who underwent TLV. RESULTS Clinical characteristics other than pT stage were comparable between groups. The TLV group had shorter thoracic operation time than the OLV group. No patients underwent conversion to open thoracotomy. The PaO2\/FiO2 ratios of the TLV group on postoperative day (POD) 5 and on POD7 were significantly higher than those of the OLV group. C-reactive protein levels on POD7 were lower in the TLV group than in the OLV group. There were no significant differences with respect to postoperative complications between the OLV and TLV groups. In the TLV group, the white blood cell count on POD7 was significantly lower than that in the OLV group; body temperature showed a similar trend immediately after surgery and on POD1. CONCLUSIONS In this study, we demonstrated that, compared with OLV, TLV in the prone position provides better oxygenation and reduced inflammation in the postoperative course.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Microelectrode recording (MER) for target refinement is widely used in deep brain stimulator insertion for Parkinson disease. Signals may be influenced by anesthetics when patients receive general anesthesia (GA). This study determined the inhibitory concentration of propofol on MER signals when it was coadministered with dexmedetomidine. METHODS Patients were anesthetized with dexmedetomidine (0.5 \u00b5g\u00b7kg loading, followed by infusion at 0.4 \u00b5g\u00b7kg\u00b7h) and propofol through target-controlled infusion for general anesthesia with tracheal intubation. The surgeon conducted the online scoring of the background signals, spiking frequency, amplitude, and pattern of single-unit activities by using a 0-10 verbal numerical rating scale (NRS; 0, maximal suppression; 10, minimal suppression), and responses were grouped into suppression (NRS \u2264 6) and nonsuppression (NRS > 6). The median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of propofol (as target effect-site concentrations: Ceprop) was determined using modified Dixon's up-and-down method (UDM). Probit regression analysis was further used to obtain the dose-response relationship, and IC05 and IC95 were calculated. RESULTS Twenty-three adult patients participated in this study. Under the concomitant infusion of dexmedetomidine, the predicted IC50 value (95% confidence interval; CI) of Ceprop for neuronal suppression during MER was 1.29 (1.24-1.34) \u00b5g\u00b7mL as calculated using modified Dixon's UDM. Using probit analysis, the estimated IC05, IC50, and IC95 values (95% CIs) were 1.17 (0.87-1.23), 1.28 (1.21-1.34), and 1.40 (1.33-1.85) \u00b5g\u00b7mL, respectively.

The authors hypothesized that the choice of neuromuscular blockade reversal (neostigmine vs. sugammadex) may be associated with a lower incidence of major pulmonary complications. METHODS Twelve U.S. Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group hospitals were included in a multicenter observational matched-cohort study of surgical cases between January 2014 and August 2018. Adult patients undergoing elective inpatient noncardiac surgical procedures with general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation receiving a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade agent and reversal were included. Exact matching criteria included institution, sex, age, comorbidities, obesity, surgical procedure type, and neuromuscular blockade agent (rocuronium vs. vecuronium). Other preoperative and intraoperative factors were compared and adjusted in the case of residual imbalance. The composite primary outcome was major postoperative pulmonary complications, defined as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or other pulmonary complications (including pneumonitis; pulmonary congestion; iatrogenic pulmonary embolism, infarction, or pneumothorax). Secondary outcomes focused on the components of pneumonia and respiratory failure. RESULTS Of 30,026 patients receiving sugammadex, 22,856 were matched to 22,856 patients receiving neostigmine. Out of 45,712 patients studied, 1,892 (4.1%) were diagnosed with the composite primary outcome (3.5% sugammadex vs. 4.8% neostigmine). A total of 796 (1.7%) patients had pneumonia (1.3% vs. 2.2%), and 582 (1.3%) respiratory failure (0.8% vs. 1.7%). In multivariable analysis, sugammadex administration was associated with a 30% reduced risk of pulmonary complications (adjusted odds ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.77), 47% reduced risk of pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.62), and 55% reduced risk of respiratory failure (adjusted odds ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.56), compared to neostigmine. CONCLUSIONS Among a generalizable cohort of adult patients undergoing inpatient surgery at U.S. hospitals, the use of sugammadex was associated with a clinically and statistically significant lower incidence of major pulmonary complications. : WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: Approximately 5% of patients experience a major pulmonary complication after noncardiac surgeryInadequate reversal of neuromuscular blockade increases the risk of pulmonary complicationsIn the United States, sugammadex is used with similar frequency as neostigmine at many hospitalsSugammadex provides more rapid and effective restoration of neuromuscular tone without systemic anticholinergic activity; however, neostigmine currently remains the mainstay of practice WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: In a multicenter observational matched cohort study of noncardiac surgery, sugammadex administration was associated with a 30% reduced risk of pulmonary complications, a 47% reduced risk of pneumonia, and a 55% reduced risk of respiratory failure compared to neostigmine.",

We aimed to determine presence of large vessel occlusion (LVO), thrombus length, infarction diameter, and occurrence of hemorrhagic transformation in AIS patients with preceding DOAC as compared to VKA therapy. METHODS Using a prospectively collected cohort of AIS patients, we performed univariate and multivariable regression analyses regarding imaging outcomes. Additionally, we provide a sensitivity analysis for the subgroup of patients with confirmed therapeutic anticoagulation. RESULTS We included AIS in patients with preceding DOAC (N = 75) and VKA (N = 61) therapy, median age 79 (IQR 70-83), 39% female. Presence of any LVO between DOAC and VKA patients (29.3% versus 37.7%, P = 0.361), and target LVO for endovascular therapy (26.7% versus 27.9%, P = 1.0) was equal with a similar occlusion pattern. DOAC as compared to VKA were associated with a similar rate of target LVO for EVT (aOR 0.835, 95% CI 0.368-1.898). The presence of multiple lesions and characteristics of the thrombus were similar in DOAC and VKA patients. Acute ischemic lesion diameter in real world patients was equal in patients taking DOAC as compared to VKA. Lesion diameter in VKA patients (median 13 mm, IQR 6-26 versus median 20 mm, IQR 7-36, P = 0.001), but not DOAC patients was smaller in the setting of confirmed therapeutic VKA. The frequency of radiological hemorrhagic transformation and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in OAC patients was low. Sensitivity analysis considering only patients with confirmed therapeutic anticoagulation did not change any of the results. CONCLUSION Preceding DOAC treatment showed equal rates of LVO and infarct size as compared to VKA in AIS patients.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE Patient characteristics associated with difficult tracheal intubation using a flexible bronchoscope (FB) under general anesthesia have not been prospectively evaluated. This observational study aimed to identify demographic and morphologic factors associated with difficult FB intubation. METHODS We recruited 420 adult elective surgery patients undergoing tracheal intubation during general anesthesia. Patients characteristics were recorded including age, sex, weight, height, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, history of snoring, obstructive sleep apnea, Mallampati score, upper lip bite test score, neck circumference and skinfold thickness, maximal neck flexion and extension angles, absence of teeth, Cormack and Lehane grade, presence of blood or secretions during intubation, as well as the inter-incisor, thyromental, sternothyroid, and manubriomental distances. The time (duration) needed to complete intubation (primary endpoint) and the number of attempts needed were correlated with these patient characteristics in a multivariable analysis. RESULTS Intubation was successful on the first attempt in 409\/420 patients (97%). Seven patients (1.7%) needed more than one attempt. Failure to intubate with the FB occurred in four patients (1%). A correlation was found between intubation duration and visibility impaired by secretions or blood (P < 0.001), higher neck skinfold thickness (P < 0.001), and larger endotracheal tube diameter (relative to a constant 5.5 mm FB; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The presence of secretions or blood that impair FB glottic visualization, a larger diameter endotracheal tube on the same size FB, as well as higher neck skinfold thickness may prolong the duration of FB intubation under general anesthesia.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND WEB treatment is an endovascular approach for wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms that has demonstrated high safety and good efficacy in mid-term follow-up. While evaluating safety in the long term is important to determine if delayed adverse events occur affecting late morbidity and mortality, the most important point to evaluate is the long-term stability of aneurysm occlusion. The current analysis reports the 3-year clinical and anatomical results of WEB treatment in the combined population of two European trials (WEBCAST (WEB Clinical Assessment of Intrasaccular Aneurysm Therapy) and WEBCAST-2). METHODS Aneurysm occlusion was evaluated using a 3-grade scale: complete occlusion, neck remnant, and aneurysm remnant. RESULTS The safety population comprised 79 patients. The efficacy population comprised 61 aneurysms. Aneurysm locations were middle cerebral artery in 32\/61 aneurysms (52.5%), anterior communicating artery in 13\/61 (21.3%), basilar artery in 9\/61 (14.8%), and internal carotid artery terminus in 7\/61 (11.5%). No adverse events related to the device or procedure occurred between 2 and 3 years. At 3 years, complete occlusion was observed in 31\/61 (50.8%) aneurysms, neck remnant in 20\/61 (32.8%), and aneurysm remnant in 10\/61 (16.4%). Between 1 year and 3 years, aneurysm occlusion was improved or stable in 53\/61 (86.9%) aneurysms and worsened in 8\/61 (13.1%). Worsening was mostly from complete occlusion to neck remnant in 6\/61 (9.8%) aneurysms. The retreatment rate at 3 years was 11.4%. CONCLUSIONS This analysis confirms the high safety profile of WEB. Moreover, evidence demonstrates the great stability of aneurysm occlusion with adequate occlusion (complete occlusion or neck remnant) in 83.6% of aneurysms.

However, the influence of hemodynamic factors on clinical outcome is still unclear after EVT. Dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) is an important brain reserve mechanism and is impaired after AIS. This study aimed to explore the role of dCA in predicting the outcome of AIS patients after EVT. METHODS AIS patients with severe stenosis\/occlusion of unilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) or internal carotid and treatment with EVT were enrolled to receive dCA examinations at the 24 h, 72 h and 7th day after stroke onset. Healthy volunteers were also recruited as controls. DCA was recorded from spontaneous fluctuations of blood pressure and MCA flow velocity. Transfer function analysis was used to derive dCA parameters, including phase difference (PD) and coherence in the low-frequency range (0.06-0.12 Hz). The clinical outcome was measured using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days after onset. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to reveal the correlation between dCA and clinical outcomes. The receiver operation characteristics (ROC) curve was performed to determine the cut-off point of PD. RESULTS A total of 62 AIS patients and 77 healthy controls were included. Compared with controls, dCA were impaired bilaterally till to 7th day after onset in patients, presenting as much lower PD value on the ipsilateral side. During follow-up, we found that PD on the ipsilateral side at 24 h after onset was significantly lower in patients with unfavourable outcome (n = 41) than those with favourable outcome (n = 21), even after adjustment of confounding factors (p = 0.009). ROC curve analysis revealed that PD < 26.93\u00b0 was an independent predictor of unfavourable-outcome. CONCLUSION In AIS patients after EVT, dCA was impaired on both sides over the first 7 days. PD on the ipsilateral side at 24 h after onset is an independent unfavourable-outcome predictor for AIS after EVT.",

OBJECTIVES To construct a comprehensive model to predict perioperative RBC transfusion in patients undergoing isolated CABG using adjusted preoperative variables. METHODS Perioperative data of 1253 patients who underwent isolated CABG by the same surgical team were collected from April 2018 to March 2019. Logistic regression analyses were used to establish equations to construct two models for predicting intraoperative and postoperative RBC transfusions, respectively. All significant variables included in the two models were combined to form a comprehensive model to predict perioperative RBC transfusion. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the discriminatory power of the models. RESULTS The total RBC transfusion rate for CABG patients during hospitalization was 29.05%. The rate of intraoperative and postoperative RBC transfusions was 6.9% and 26.7%, respectively. Eight variables in a total of 30 risk factors constituted the intraoperative prediction model, 12 variables constituted the postoperative prediction model, and 13 variables for the combined model. The AUC of the three models were 0.87, 0.82, and 0.83, respectively, demonstrating moderate discriminatory power for RBC transfusion during the intraoperative, postoperative, and perioperative periods.

Aim In this prospective study, we aimed to investigate the hypothesis that risk of respiratory depression could be reduced and the desired level of sedation with minimal doses of propofol could be achieved by using BIS monitoring in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures. Material and methods Sixty patients in the ASA 1-2 category, who were scheduled for an ERCP with sedation, were randomly divided into two groups. The procedure was performed, and sedation was administered so that the patient's Ramsay Sedation Score (RSS) would be 4-5 in the first group (group 1) and the patient's BIS value would be 65-75 in the second group (group 2). Cardiopulmonary complications, the total duration of the procedure, and the total amount of propofol administered were recorded. Results The mean SpO2 measurements at the third minute, fifth minute, and 10th minute were higher in the BIS group (p < 0.001) (p < 0.05). The mean number of respirations during the third, fifth, 10th, and 15th minute of sedation was significantly higher in the RSS group than in the BIS group (p < 0.05). There was no difference between the groups in terms of recovery time, total propofol amount, and additional doses of bolus propofol. Conclusions BIS monitoring during sedation with propofol for ERCP did not reduce total propofol use, but it may be an efficient guide for the timing of additional dose administration, which could reduce the risk of respiratory depression, and it could be used safely as an objective method in the follow-up of level of sedation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND The application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may reduce dynamic strain during mechanical ventilation. Although numerous approaches for PEEP titration have been proposed, there is no accepted strategy for titrating optimal PEEP. By analyzing intratidal compliance profiles, PEEP may be individually titrated for patients. METHODS After obtaining informed consent, 60 consecutive patients undergoing general anesthesia were randomly allocated to mechanical ventilation with PEEP 5 cmH2O (control group) or PEEP individually titrated, guided by an analysis of the intratidal compliance profile (intervention group). The primary endpoint was the frequency of each nonlinear intratidal compliance (CRS) profile of the respiratory system (horizontal, increasing, decreasing, and mixed). The secondary endpoints measured were respiratory mechanics, hemodynamic variables, and regional ventilation, which was assessed via electrical impedance tomography. RESULTS The frequencies of the CRS profiles were comparable between the groups. Besides PEEP [control: 5.0 (0.0), intervention: 5.8 (1.1) cmH2O, p < 0.001], the respiratory and hemodynamic variables were comparable between the two groups. The compliance profile analysis showed no significant differences between the two groups. The loss of ventral and dorsal regional ventilation was higher in the control [ventral: 41.0 (16.3)%; dorsal: 25.9 (13.8)%] than in the intervention group [ventral: 29.3 (17.6)%; dorsal: 16.4 (12.7)%; p (ventral) = 0.039, p (dorsal) = 0.028]. CONCLUSIONS Unfavorable compliance profiles indicating tidal derecruitment were found less often than in earlier studies. Individualized PEEP titration resulted in slightly higher PEEP. A slight global increase in aeration associated with this was indicated by regional gain and loss analysis. Differences in dorsal to ventral ventilation distribution were not found.

We aim to perform evidence synthesis to determine the outcome of neurodevelopmental impairment and intellectual disability among survivors of neonatal sepsis. The data gathered will inform on the long-term neurocognitive outcomes of neonates with sepsis and the measures used to document their developmental disability. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will perform a search based on the following parameters: neonates and infants less than 90 days old diagnosed with sepsis who had neurocognitive outcomes or measures of developmental disability reported. We will search PubMed, Cochrane Central, Embase and Web of Science for articles in English language published between January 2010 and December 2019. Clinical trials and observational studies will be included. Two independent reviewers will screen studies for eligibility. Data extraction will then be performed using a standardised form. The quality of evidence and risk of bias will be assessed using Cochrane Collaboration's tool and Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of Intervention (ROBINS-I). The results will be synthesised qualitatively and pooled for meta-analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No formal ethical approval is required as there is no collection of primary data.

During POEM, cardiovascular dynamics can be impaired by capnoperitoneum, capnomediastinum, and systemic carbon dioxide accumulation. We systematically investigated changes in cardiovascular dynamics during POEM. We included 31 patients having POEM in this single-center prospective observational study. Before and every 5 min during POEM we measured mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), stroke volume index (SVI), and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) using non-invasive finger cuff-derived pulse wave analysis. During POEM, the median MAP was higher than the median baseline MAP of 77 (67;86) mmHg.

However, current measurement techniques are limited since they are assessed intermittently at non-physiological frequencies or involve specialized equipment. To this end, we introduce ZVV, a practical approach to continuously track resistance and elastance during Variable Ventilation (VV), in which frequency and tidal volume vary from breath-to-breath. ZVV segments airway pressure and flow recordings into individual breaths, calculates resistance and elastance for each breath, bins them according to frequency or tidal volume and plots the results against bin means. ZVV's feasibility was assessed clinically in five human patients with acute lung injury, experimentally in five mice ventilated before and after lavage injury, and computationally using a viscoelastic respiratory model. ZVV provided continuous measurements in both settings, while the computational study revealed <2% estimation errors. Our findings support ZVV as a feasible technique to assess respiratory mechanics under physiological conditions. Additionally, in humans, ZVV detected a decrease in resistance and elastance with time by 12.8% and 6.2%, respectively, suggesting that VV can improve lung recruitment in some patients and can therefore potentially serve both as a dual diagnostic and therapeutic tool.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between right ventricular (RV) function and cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity and cerebral oxygenation was assessed in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH). Echocardiographic, transcranial Doppler, and hemodynamic data from 37 neonates with moderate-severe HIE + TH were reviewed. Twenty healthy newborns served as controls. Cardiac dysfunction in HIE + TH was characterized by a predominant RV dysfunction, with concomitantly reduced CBF velocity. A significant correlation was found between CBF velocity and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), RV output (RVO), and stroke volume (SVRV), as well as with left ventricular output and stroke volume. Brain oxygenation (rSO2) correlated significantly with RVO, SVRV, TAPSE, ejection fraction, and fractional shortening, whereas cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOEc) correlated with RVO, SVRV, RV myocardial performance index, and superior vena cava flow. CBF velocity and cerebral NIRS correlations were stronger with parameters of right ventricular performance.Conclusion: CBF velocity and brain oxygenation correlate predominantly with RV function in HIE + TH. This suggests a preferential contribution of RV performance to cerebral hemodynamics in this context.What is Known:\u2022 Neonates with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy frequently exhibit alterations of cardiac function and cerebral blood flow.\u2022 These are considered organ-specific consequences of perinatal asphyxia.What is New:\u2022 We show that cerebral blood flow velocity and brain oxygenation are correlated predominantly with right ventricular function during therapeutic hypothermia.\u2022 This suggests a potential direct contribution of right ventricular performance to cerebral hemodynamics in this context.",

Systematic review and meta-analysis is a useful tool to collate experimental data and investigate the basis of its conclusions. We searched three online databases to identify studies testing systemic hypothermia as monotherapy for treatment of animals subjected to a TBI. Data pertaining to TBI paradigm, animal subjects and hypothermia management were extracted as well as those relating to risk of bias. We pooled outcome data where sufficient numbers allowed and investigated heterogeneity in neurobehavioral outcomes using multivariate meta-regression. We identified 90 publications reporting 272 experiments testing hypothermia in animals subject to TBI. The subjects were mostly small animals, with well-established models predominating. Target temperature was comparable to clinical trial data but treatment was initiated very early. Study quality was low and there was some evidence of publication bias. Delay to treatment, comorbidity and blinded outcome assessment appeared to predict neurobehavioral outcome on multivariate meta-regression. Therapeutic hypothermia appears to be an efficacious treatment in experimental TBI, which differs from the clinical evidence. The preclinical literature showed limitations in quality and design and these both appeared to affect neurobehavioral experiment outcome.

        "abstract": "Background and Purpose- The benefit that endovascular thrombectomy offers to patients with stroke with large vessel occlusions depends strongly on reperfusion grade as defined by the expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) scale. Our aim was to determine the lifetime health and cost consequences of the quality of reperfusion for patients, healthcare systems, and society. Methods- A Markov model estimated lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and lifetime costs of endovascular thrombectomy-treated patients with stroke based on eTICI grades. The analysis was performed over a lifetime horizon in a United States setting, adopting healthcare and societal perspectives. The reference case analysis was conducted for stroke at 65 years of age. National health and cost consequences of improved eTICI 2c\/3 reperfusion rates were estimated. Input parameters were based on best available evidence. Results- Lifetime QALYs increased for every grade of improved reperfusion (median QALYs for eTICI 0\/1: 2.62; eTICI 2a: 3.46; eTICI 2b: 5.42; eTICI 2c: 5.99; eTICI 3: 6.73). Achieving eTICI 3 over eTICI 2b reperfusion resulted on average in 1.31 incremental QALYs as well as healthcare and societal cost savings of $10 327 and $20 224 per patient. A 10% increase in the eTICI 2c\/3 reperfusion rate of all annually endovascular thrombectomy-treated patients with stroke in the United States is estimated to yield additional 3656 QALYs and save $21.0 million and $36.8 million for the healthcare system and society, respectively. Conclusions- Improved reperfusion grants patients with stroke additional QALYs and leads to long-term cost savings. Procedural strategies to achieve complete reperfusion should be assessed for safety and feasibility, even when initial reperfusion seems to be adequate.",

We reported 2 cases of Coronavirus Disease 19 receiving tracheal intubation twice during the hospitalization. PATIENT CONCERNS Two elderly patients with onset of fever and upper respiratory tract infection were confirmed as Coronavirus Disease 19, 1 of whom had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease previously. With active antiviral and noninvasive respiratory supportive therapy, there was no improvement, thus mechanical ventilation (MV) was adopted. Combining with symptomatic and supportive treatment, their oxygenation recovered and then extubation was carried out. However, 96 hours later, they underwent endotracheal intubation again due to their Coronavirus Disease 19 progression. DIAGNOSIS Critically ill Coronavirus Disease 19 requiring tracheal intubation owing to respiratory failure with lung.javascript. INTERVENTIONS Initial Strategy for respiratory failure included endotracheal intubation, MV, antiviral treatment and cortisol in both cases. When extubation criteria were satisfied, early discontinuation of MV was conducted, then rehabilitation exercise and nutritional support followed. However, 96 hours later, the disease progressed leading to respiratory failure again, thus reintubation was performed. Later, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was performed owing to aggravation of respiratory failure, assisted by prone position treatment and sputum drainage, then status became stable and stepped into recovery stage. OUTCOMES Both patients underwent reintubation, and their MV time and Intensive care unit residence time were prolonged. Through prone position treatment, sputum drainage and awake extracorporeal membrane oxygenation strategy, patient has been transferred to rehabilitation unit in Case 1, and patient in Case 2 has been in recovery stage as well with stable pulmonary status and was expected to receive evaluation in recent future. LESSONS Course of Coronavirus Disease 19 is relatively longer, and failure rate of simple early extubation seemes higher. To reduce the likelihood of reintubation and iatrogenic injury, individualized assessment is recommended.",

Respiratory care, early mobilization, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation were started in the ad hoc isolation ward of our rehabilitation center. At baseline, muscle function was consistent with intensive care unit-acquired weakness and the patient still needed mechanical ventilation (MV) and oxygen support. During the first week of RRP in isolation, the patient was successfully weaned from MV, the tracheal cannula was removed, and the walking capacity was recovered. At the end of the RRP, continued in a standard department, respiratory muscles strength increased by 7% and muscle function improved as indicated by the quadriceps size enlargement of 13% and the change of the Medical Research Council sum score from 48\/60 to 58\/60. DISCUSSION Providing RRP in patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS involves risks for operators and organizational difficulties, especially in rehabilitation centers; nevertheless, its continuity is important to prevent the development of permanent disabilities in previously healthy subjects.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM To analyze the incidence of peripheral emboli after successful mechanical thrombectomy (MT) of intracranial large vessel occlusions (LVO). METHODS We performed a prospective analysis of patients with intracranial LVO who underwent successful MT and received a 1.5 T MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in standard- and high-resolution as well as susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) on the day following the intervention. Reperfusion grade was assessed on post-thrombectomy digital subtraction angiography (DSA) using the expanded thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (eTICI) scale. Punctuate DWI lesions distal to the DWI core lesion were classified as peripheral emboli. DWI lesions outside the primary affected vascular territory were classified as emboli into new territories. Additionally, SWI and post-thrombectomy DSA were analyzed and correlated to findings on DWI. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients undergoing successful MT met the inclusion criteria. In 26\/28 patients (93%), a total of 324 embolic lesions were detected in DWI representing 2.1% of the cumulated ischemic core volume. 151 peripheral emboli were detected in standard-resolution DWI, 173 additional emboli were uncovered in high-resolution DWI. Eight out of nine patients with an eTICI 3 reperfusion had embolic lesions (29 DWI lesions). 9.6% (31\/324) of peripheral emboli were observed in vascular territories not affected by the LVO. SWI lesions were observed in close proximity to 10.2% (33\/324) of DWI lesions. CONCLUSIONS Peripheral emboli are frequent after MT even after complete reperfusion. These emboli occur rather in the vascular territory of the occluded vessel than in other territories. A large proportion of peripheral emboli is only detected by high-resolution DWI.",

We aimed to systematically review the prevalence, predictors of and survival from neurologic complications in patients who have undergone extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE (PubMed) and six other databases (EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL Plus, Web of Science, and Scopus) from inception to August 2019. STUDY SELECTION Randomized controlled trials and observational studies in patients greater than 18 years old. DATA EXTRACTION Two independent reviewers extracted the data. Study quality was assessed by the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort and case-control studies, and the Murad tool for case series. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to pool data. DATA SYNTHESIS The 78 studies included in our analysis encompassed 50,049 patients, of which 6,261 (12.5%) received extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Among extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation patients, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 52-59 yr), 3,933 were male (63%), 3,019 had out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (48%), and 2,289 had initial shockable heart rhythm (37%). The most common etiology of cardiac arrest was acute coronary syndrome (n = 1,657, 50% of reported). The median extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation duration was 3.2 days (interquartile range, 2.1-4.9 d). Overall, 27% (95% CI, 0.17-0.39%) had at least one neurologic complication, 23% (95% CI, 0.14-0.32%) hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, 6% (95% CI, 0.02-0.11%) ischemic stroke, 6% (95% CI, 0.01-0.16%) seizures, and 4% (95% CI, 0.01-0.1%) intracerebral hemorrhage. Seventeen percent (95% CI, 0.12-0.23%) developed brain death. The overall survival rate after extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation was 29% (95% CI, 0.26-0.33%) and good neurologic outcome was achieved in 24% (95% CI, 0.21-0.28%). CONCLUSIONS One in four patients developed acute brain injury after extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the most common type was hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. One in four extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation patients achieved good neurologic outcome. Further research on assessing predictors of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation-associated brain injury is necessary.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE Propofol clearance can be reduced when cardiac output (CO) is decreased. This clearance reduction may alter the pharmacokinetics of propofol and worsen the predictive performance of target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol. The head-down position (HDP) and CO2 pneumoperitoneum, which are required for robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP), may cause changes in CO. We investigated the predictive performance of propofol TCI during CO2 pneumoperitoneum in patients who underwent RALP in the HDP. METHODS Fifteen male patients received propofol TCI using the Diprifusor model. Propofol concentrations were measured at seven time points: (T1) 15 min after anesthesia induction; (T2) before the insufflation; (T3, T4, and T5) 15, 60, and 90 min, respectively, after insufflation in the HDP; (T6) before the release of pneumoperitoneum in the HDP; and (T7) 15 min after the release of pneumoperitoneum in the supine position. Cardiac index (CI) was assessed using an arterial pulse contour CO monitor. The predictive performance of propofol TCI was evaluated by calculating the performance errors (PE) in propofol concentrations for each data point. The relationship between CI and PE was examined. Median PE (MDPE) and median absolute PE (MDAPE) were calculated as measures of bias and accuracy, respectively. RESULTS A total of 104 blood samples were analyzed. There was significantly negative correlation between CI and PE. The predictive performance of propofol TCI during pneumoperitoneum in the HDP was acceptable (MDPE = - 1.5% and MDAPE = 18.8%).

OBJECTIVE The current study aims to test whether the blood flow within the contused spinal cord can be assessed in a rodent model via the acoustic window of the laminectomy utilizing transcutaneous ultrasound. SETTING Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Washington, Seattle WA. METHODS Long-Evans rats (n = 12) were subjected to a traumatic thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI). Three days and 10 weeks after injury, animals underwent imaging of the contused spinal cord using ultrafast contrast-enhanced ultrasound with a Vantage ultrasound research system in combination with a 15 MHz transducer. Lesion size and signal-to-noise ratios were estimated via transcutaneous, subcutaneous, or epidural ultrasound acquisition through the acoustic window created by the original laminectomy. RESULTS Following laminectomy, transcutaneous and subcutaneous contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging allowed for assessment of perfusion and vascular flow in the contused rodent spinal cord. An average loss of 7.2 dB from transcutaneous to subcutaneous and the loss of 5.1 dB from subcutaneous to epidural imaging in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was observed. The hypoperfused injury center was measured transcutaneously, subcutaneously and epidurally (5.78 \u00b1 0.86, 5.91 \u00b1 0.53, 5.65 \u00b1 1.07 mm2) at 3 days post injury. The same animals were reimaged again at 10 weeks following SCI, and the area of hypoperfusion had decreased significantly compared with the 3-day measurements detected via transcutaneous, subcutaneous, and epidural imaging respectively (0.69 \u00b1 0.05, 1.09 \u00b1 0.11, 0.95 \u00b1 0.11 mm2, p < 0.001).

Pleural effusions continue to be a complication that affect many surgical patients and are associated with increased morbidity, many times requiring readmission and additional invasive procedures. The risks for development of pleural effusion after hospital discharge are ill-defined, which leads to uncertainty related to strategies for prevention. Our primary objective was to determine, in patients with CHD requiring cardiopulmonary bypass, the prevalence of post-surgical pleural effusions leading to readmission. The secondary objective was to identify risk factors associated with post-surgical pleural effusions requiring readmission. We identified 4417 citations; 10 full-text articles were included in the final review. Of the included studies, eight focused on single-ventricle palliation, one looked at Tetralogy of Fallot patients, and another on pleural effusion in the setting of post-pericardiotomy syndrome. Using a random-effect model, the overall prevalence of pleural effusion requiring readmission was 10.2% (95% CI 4.6; 17.6). Heterogeneity was high (I2 = 91%). In a subpopulation of patients after single-ventricle palliation, the prevalence was 13.0% (95% CI 6.0;21.0), whereas it was 3.0% (95% CI 0.4;6.75) in patients mostly with biventricular physiology. We were unable to accurately assess risk factors. A better understanding of this complication with a focus on single-ventricle physiology will allow for improved risk stratification, family counseling, and earlier recognition of pleural effusion in this patient population.",

Intraoperatively OAA\/S, BIS, and propofol (timing and exact amounts) administered were recorded. Cerebrospinal fluid was collected for Alzheimer's (AD) biomarkers. Mean Ce level (AvgCe) during surgery was calculated using the area under the Ce measurement series from incision to closure, divided by surgical time. Average OAA\/S (AvgOAA\/S), and BIS (AvgBIS) were similarly calculated. Pearson correlations of AvgCe with AvgOAA\/S and AvgBIS were calculated overall and by CDR. Nonparametric locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) fits of AvgOAA\/S and AvgBIS on AvgCe were produced, stratified by CDR. Multivariable regression incorporating baseline cognitive measurements or AD biomarkers assessed AvgOAA\/S or AvgBIS associations with AvgCe.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Most of the research on vasovagal reactions has focused on the contributions of cardiovascular activity to the development of symptoms. However, other research suggests that additional mechanisms like hyperventilation may contribute to the process. The goal of the present investigation was to examine the influences of cardiovascular and respiratory variables on vasovagal symptoms. METHODS This study was part of a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of behavioral techniques on the prevention of vasovagal reactions in blood donors. Data from the no-treatment control group were analyzed. The final sample was composed of 160 college and university students. Observational and self-report measures of symptoms were obtained. Physiological variables were measured mainly using respiratory capnometry. RESULTS While respiration rate remained stable throughout donation, change in end-tidal CO2 was associated with requiring treatment for a reaction during donation (OR = .57, 95% CI = .41-.79, p = .001) and self-reported symptoms measured in the post-donation period using the Blood Donation Reactions Inventory (\u03b2=-.152, 95% CI= -.28- -.02, t=-2.32, p=.022). Individuals with higher levels of pre-donation anxiety displayed larger decreases in end-tidal CO2 throughout the procedure (F(2,236) = 3.64, p = .043, \u03b7p = .030). BDRI scores were related to changes in systolic (\u03b2=-.022, 95% CI= -.04- -.004, t=-2.39, p=.019) and diastolic blood pressure (\u03b2=-.038, 95% CI= -.06- -.02, t=-4.03, p <.001). CONCLUSIONS While the vasovagal reaction has traditionally been viewed as a primarily cardiovascular event, the present results suggest that hyperventilation also plays a role in the development of vasovagal symptoms.",

        "abstract": "Before 2015, endovascular treatment (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke was considered a promising treatment option. Based on limited evidence, it was performed in several dedicated stroke centers worldwide on selected patients. Since 2015, EVT for patients with intracranial large vessel occlusion has quickly been implemented as standard treatment in many countries worldwide, supported by the revised international guidelines based on solid evidence from multiple clinical trials. We describe the development in use of EVT in the Netherlands before, during, and after the pivotal EVT trials. We used data from all patients who were treated with EVT in the Netherlands from January 2002 until December 2018. We undertook a time-series analysis to examine trends in the use of EVT using Poisson regression analysis. Incidence rate ratios per year with 95% CIs were obtained to demonstrate the impact and implementation after the publication of the EVT trial results. We made regional observation plots, adjusted for stroke incidence, to assess the availability and use of the treatment in the country. In the buildup to the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands), a slow increase of EVT patients was observed, with 0.2% of all ischemic stroke patients receiving EVT. Before the trial results were formally announced, a statistically significant increase in EVT-treated patients per year was observed (incidence rate ratio, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.46-2.04]), and after the trial publication, an immediate steep increase was seen, followed by a more gradual increase (incidence rate ratio, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.77-2.59]). In 2018, the percentage of ischemic stroke patients receiving EVT increased to 5.8%. A well-developed infrastructure, a pragmatic approach toward the use of EVT in clinical practice, in combination with a strict adherence by the regulatory authorities to national evidence-based guidelines has led to successful implementation of EVT in the Netherlands. Ongoing efforts are directed at further increasing the proportion of stroke patients with EVT in all regions of the country.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is associated with a high risk of disability and mortality. The objective of this study was to investigate prognostic factors in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion treated with mechanical thrombectomy, focusing on collateral status and recanalization time from symptom onset. METHODS Eligible patients from January 2012 to October 2019 who underwent endovascular treatment due to acute BAO were reviewed. The baseline posterior circulation collateral status was assessed with the basilar artery on computed tomography angiography score and posterior circulation collateral score. Good outcomes were defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of \u22642 at 3 months and successful recanalization as Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction grades 2b, 3. The associations between baseline and clinical parameters and favorable outcomes were evaluated with logistic regression. RESULTS Our sample included a total of 81 eligible patients (49 males, mean age 70.3 years) with a median baseline and discharge National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 12. Patients with good outcomes showed a lower baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, a greater proportion of distal BAO, and a higher basilar artery on computed tomography angiography and posterior circulation collateral score (P<0.001). According to subgroup analysis of patients within and over 6 or 12 hours, the time from symptom onset to recanalization was not correlated with good outcomes. Multivariable logistic analysis showed baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale <15 (odds ratio, 8.49 [95% CI, 2.01-35.82]; P=0.004), posterior circulation collateral score \u22656 (odds ratio, 3.79 [95% CI, 1.05-13.66]; P=0.042), and distal BAO (odds ratio, 3.67 [95% CI, 1.10-12.26]; P=0.035) were independent predictors of good outcomes. CONCLUSIONS This study suggested that good collateral circulation and distal BAO are independent predictors of clinical outcome after endovascular treatment in patients with acute BAO. In particular, patients with good initial collateral status and distal BAO may consider endovascular treatment even if the treatment is started beyond the standard time limits.",

The aim of this study was to report the first clinical multicenter experience with the new Scepter Mini dual-lumen microballoon catheter. METHODS Patients with cerebral or spinal vascular malformations treated with the Scepter Mini at seven European neurovascular centers were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical data, angiographic features of the vascular malformations, procedural parameters including the type of application, navigability, technical failures, complications and embolization success were assessed. RESULTS The usage of 34 Scepter Mini microballoon catheters in 20 patients was analyzed. Most treated malformations (80.0%) were cerebral arteriovenous malformations. Four different applications were reported: embolization via Scepter Mini (n=23, 67.6%), balloon-occlusion with simultaneous embolization via a second microcatheter (n=3, 8.8%), diagnostic angiography with simultaneous balloon-inflation for flow arrest (n=4, 11.8%), and navigation support (n=4, 11.8%). The mean diameter of the blood vessels in which the Scepter Mini was inflated was 1.9\u00b10.5 mm. The navigability of the Scepter Mini was rated as 'easy' or 'very easy' in 88.2% of cases. Complete occlusion of the malformation was achieved in 60.9% of cases. Technical failures occurred in 4\/23 embolization procedures, and all were related to insufficient stability of the balloon within the vessel. No complications related to the Scepter Mini were observed, while unrelated complications occurred in three patients (15.0%). CONCLUSIONS The Scepter Mini is a promising new device for balloon-assisted embolization of cerebrospinal vascular malformations via small feeders. Beyond embolization, the Scepter Mini can also be used for other applications, such as superselective flow arrest and navigation support.",

We report our experience with unsuccessful MT and analyze technical reasons plus patient-related parameters for failure. METHODS Five hundred ninety-six patients with acute ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation and intention to perform MT with an aspiration catheter and\/or stent retriever were analyzed. Failure was defined as 0, 1, or 2a on the mTICI scale. Patients with failing MT were analyzed for interventional progress and compared to patients with successful intervention, whereby parameters included demographics, medical history, stroke presentation, and treatment. RESULTS One hundred of the 596 (16.8%) interventions failed. In 20 cases, thrombus could not be accessed or passed with the device. Peripheral arterial occlusive disease is common in those patients. In 80 patients, true stent retriever failure occurred. In this group, coagulation disorders are associated with poor results, whereas atrial fibrillation is associated with success. The administration of intravenous thrombolysis and intake of nitric oxide donors are associated with recanalization success. Intervention duration was significantly longer in the failing group. CONCLUSION In 20% of failing MT, thrombus cannot be reached\/passed. Direct carotid puncture or surgical arterial access could be considered in these cases. In 80% of failing interventions, thrombus can be passed with the device, but the occluded vessel cannot be recanalized. Rescue techniques can be an option. Development of new devices and techniques is necessary to improve recanalization rates. Assessment of pre-existing illness could sensitize for occurring complications.",

Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the benefits of high-flow nasal cannula in the peri-intubation period. DATA SOURCES We performed a comprehensive search of relevant databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science). STUDY SELECTION We included randomized clinical trials that compared high-flow nasal cannula to other noninvasive oxygen delivery systems in the peri-intubation period. DATA EXTRACTION Our primary outcome was severe desaturation (defined as peripheral oxygen saturation reading < 80% during intubation). Secondary outcomes included peri-intubation complications, apneic time, PaO2 before and after intubation, PaCO2 after intubation, ICU length of stay, and short-term mortality. DATA SYNTHESIS We included 10 randomized clinical trials (n = 1,017 patients). High-flow nasal cannula had no effect on the occurrence rate of peri-intubation hypoxemia (relative risk, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.68-1.42; 0.3% absolute risk reduction, moderate certainty), serious complications (relative risk, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.71-1.06), apneic time (mean difference, 10.3 s higher with high-flow nasal cannula; 95% CI, 11.0 s lower to 31.7 s higher), PaO2 measured after preoxygenation (mean difference, 3.6 mm Hg higher; 95% CI, 3.5 mm Hg lower to 10.7 mm Hg higher), or PaO2 measured after intubation (mean difference, 27.0 mm Hg higher; 95% CI, 13.2 mm Hg lower to 67.2 mm Hg higher), when compared with conventional oxygen therapy. There was also no effect on postintubation PaCO2, ICU length of stay, or 28-day mortality.

METHODS Among 815 aneurysms treated with embolization, recurrence was in 114 aneurysms (14.0%). Forty-three recurrent aneurysms were managed with re-embolization. Procedural complications, angiographic, and clinical results of retreatment were analyzed. RESULTS Patients with recurrent aneurysms were significantly (P < 0.01) younger than without recurrence (51.09 \u00b1 10.46 vs. 53.88 \u00b1 9.61 years). Recurrent aneurysms (n = 114) were significantly (P = 0.00) greater (11.12 \u00b1 8.35 vs. 5.81 \u00b1 3.44 mm) with a significantly (P = 0.00) greater neck (4.34 \u00b1 2.26 vs. 2.90 \u00b1 1.44 mm) than without recurrence. The rupture status of aneurysms significantly (P = 0.00) affected recurrence at follow-up. Significantly (P = 0.00) more aneurysms without recurrence were treated with advanced embolization techniques (81.0% vs. 62.3%) and got complete occlusion at the first embolization than those with recurrence (93.7% vs. 36.8%). In treating 43 recurrent aneurysms, stent-assisted recoiling was used in 48.8% in the first retreatment and 50% in the second and third retreatment procedures. Angiographic follow-up in 38 (88.4%) cases showed complete or near complete occlusion in 30 aneurysms, with the rest eight aneurysms experiencing a second recurrence (21.1%). Of the eight aneurysms with the second recurrence, five underwent the second endovascular retreatment, with complete aneurysm occlusion achieved in three cases (60%), near-complete occlusion in one (20%), and incomplete occlusion in one case at immediate angiography and six-month follow-up. Procedure-related complications occurred in three patients.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Delayed umbilical cord clamping is associated with greater haemoglobin concentration and iron storage between 3 and 6 months of life and with less need of blood transfusion and lower incidence of neonatal hypotension compared to early umbilical cord clamping. METHODS The aim was to test the hypothesis that delayed cord clamping is better than early cord clamping in term infants born by elective caesarean section. Group A was subjected to immediate cord clamping while in the Group B, the umbilical cord was clamped 1 min after birth. Primary aim was revealed the difference in pre-ductal saturation between two groups while secondary aim was investigating the difference in HR, Ht, bilirubin and glycaemia. Pre-ductal SpO2 and HR were recorded at 5 and 10 min after birth, T was analysed 10 min after birth, glycaemia was revealed at 120 min while Ht and bilirubin were collected at 72 h. RESULTS 132 newborns were enrolled in the study and allocated in ratio 1:1 to group A or B. Delayed cord clamping did not improve SpO2, HR and T values compared to immediate cord clamping (p > 0,05). However, Group B showed greater haematocrit and bilirubin values at 72 h compared to Group A (56,71 \u00b1 6663 vs 51,56 \u00b1 6929; p < 0,05 and 8,54 \u00b1 2,90 vs 7,06 \u00b1 2,76; p < 0,05).

Methods A meta-analysis of studies that assessed AT outcomes was conducted through December 2018. Primary outcomes were changes in comorbidities at 1 year following AT. Secondary outcomes were the amount of weight loss at up to 4 years and pooled serious adverse events (SAEs). Results Five studies with 590 patients were included. At 1 year, there were improvements in metabolic conditions: mean difference (MD) in systolic blood pressure: -7.8 (-10.7 - -4.9) mm Hg; MD in diastolic blood pressure: -5.1 (-7.0 - 3.2) mm Hg; MD in triglycerides: -15.8 (-24.0 - -7.6) mg\/dL; MD in high-density lipoprotein: 3.6 (0.7-6.6) mg\/dL; MD in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c): -1.3 (-1.8 - -0.8) %; MD in aspartate transaminase: -2.7 (-4.1 - -1.3) U\/L; MD in alanine transaminase: -7.5 (-9.8 - -5.2) U\/L.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND There is no proven specific pharmacological treatment for patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The efficacy of corticosteroids in ARDS remains controversial. We aimed to assess the effects of dexamethasone in ARDS, which might change pulmonary and systemic inflammation and result in a decrease in duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality. METHODS We did a multicentre, randomised controlled trial in a network of 17 intensive care units (ICUs) in teaching hospitals across Spain in patients with established moderate-to-severe ARDS (defined by a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen of 200 mm Hg or less assessed with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cm H2O or more and FiO2 of 0\u00b75 or more at 24 h after ARDS onset). Patients with brain death, terminal-stage disease, or receiving corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs were excluded. Eligible patients were randomly assigned based on balanced treatment assignments with a computerised randomisation allocation sequence using blocks of 10 opaque, sealed envelopes to receive immediate treatment with dexamethasone or continued routine intensive care (control group). Patients in the dexamethasone group received an intravenous dose of 20 mg once daily from day 1 to day 5, which was reduced to 10 mg once daily from day 6 to day 10. Patients in both groups were ventilated with lung-protective mechanical ventilation. Allocation concealment was maintained at all sites during the trial. Primary outcome was the number of ventilator-free days at 28 days, defined as the number of days alive and free from mechanical ventilation from day of randomisation to day 28. Secondary outcome was all-cause mortality 60 days after randomisation. All analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01731795. FINDINGS Between March 28, 2013, and Dec 31, 2018, we enrolled 277 patients and randomly assigned 139 patients to the dexamethasone group and 138 to the control group. The trial was stopped by the data safety monitoring board due to low enrolment rate after enrolling more than 88% (277\/314) of the planned sample size. The mean number of ventilator-free days was higher in the dexamethasone group than in the control group (between-group difference 4\u00b78 days [95% CI 2\u00b757 to 7\u00b703]; p<0\u00b70001). At 60 days, 29 (21%) patients in the dexamethasone group and 50 (36%) patients in the control group had died (between-group difference -15\u00b73% [-25\u00b79 to -4\u00b79]; p=0\u00b70047). The proportion of adverse events did not differ significantly between the dexamethasone group and control group. The most common adverse events were hyperglycaemia in the ICU (105 [76%] patients in the dexamethasone group vs 97 [70%] patients in the control group), new infections in the ICU (eg, pneumonia or sepsis; 33 [24%] vs 35 [25%]), and barotrauma (14 [10%] vs 10 [7%]).

Yet, no evidence was offered supporting that claim. Therefore, we evaluated whether PETCO2\/PaCO2 might be relevant in assessing ARDS not associated with COVID-19. METHODS We evaluated the correspondence between PETCO2\/PaCO2 and VD\/VT measured in 561 subjects with ARDS from a previous study in whom PETCO2 data were also available. Subjects also were analyzed according to four categories representing increasing severity of PETCO2\/PaCO2 (\u22650.80, 0.61 to 0.79, 0.50-0.59 and < 0.50). Correlation was assessed by either Pearson Spearman tests, group comparisons were assessed using either ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests, and dichotomous variables assessed by Fisher Exact test. Overall mortality risk was assessed by multivariate logistic regression. Alpha was set at 0.05. RESULTS PETCO2\/PaCO2 correlated strongly with VD\/VT (R = -0.87 [-0.89, -0.85] P < 0.001). Decreasing PETCO2\/PaCO2 was associated with increased VD\/VT and hospital mortality between all groups. In the univariate analysis for every 0.01 decrease in PETCO2\/PaCO2 mortality risk increased by \u223c1% (OR: 0.009 [0.003-0.029] P < 0.001), and maintained a strong independent association with mortality risk when adjusted for other variables: 0.19 (0.04-0.91) P = 0.039. PETCO2\/PaCO2 < 0.50 was characterized both by very high VD\/VT (0.82 \u00b1 0.05, P < 0.001) and hospital mortality (70%).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is the most widely available device for short-term mechanical circulatory support, often used to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass or combined with extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation support or as a bridge to a left ventricular assist device. Although based on a relatively simple principle, its complex interaction with the cardiovascular system remains challenging and open to debate. The aim of this work was focused on the development of a new numerical model of IABP. METHODS The new model was implemented in CARDIOSIM\u00a9, which is a modular software simulator of the cardiovascular system used in research and e-learning environment. The IABP is inserted into the systemic bed divided in aortic, thoracic and two abdominal tracts modelled with resistances, inertances and compliances. The effect induced by the balloon is reproduced in each tract of the aorta by the presence of compliances connected to PIABP generator and resistances. PIABP generator reproduces the balloon pressure with the option to change IABP timing. We have used literature data to validate the potential of this new numerical model. RESULTS The results have shown that our simulations reproduced the typical effects induced during IABP assistance. We have also simulated the effects induced by the device on the hemodynamic variables when the IABP ratio was set to 1:1, 1:2, 1:4 and 1:8. The outcome of these simulations is in accordance with literature data measured in the clinical environment. CONCLUSIONS The new IABP module is easy to manage and can be used as a training tool in a clinical setting. Although based on literature data, the outcome of the simulations is encouraging. Additional work is ongoing with a view to further validate its features. The configuration of CARDIOSIM\u00a9 presented in this work allows the simulation of the effects induced by mechanical ventilatory assistance. This facility may have significant importance in the management of patients affected by COVID-19 when they require mechanical circulatory support devices.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Infection due to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), i.e. Coronavirus-associated disease 2019 (COVID-2019), may occasionally lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring in the most severe cases extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Yet, limited data, if any, are currently available on the role of ECMO in critically ill patients with COVID-19. We aimed at providing a snapshot analysis of ECMO for COVID-19 in Europe. METHODS Freely available data on ECMO in COVID-19 patients reported by the European Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (EuroELSO) were extracted and analyzed after conversion into long format. The primary outcome was the incidence of death during ECMO. Bootstrapping and logistic regression was used for inferential estimates. RESULTS Details from a total of 333 patients treated in 90 institutions spanning 17 countries were obtained, with 22% women and mean age of 52 years. Death rate was 17.1% (95% confidence interval: 13.1% to 21.1%), even if significant between-center differences were found, with some institutions reporting 100% case fatality. Exploratory inferential analysis showed no nominally statistically significant association between death and gender (p=0.788), but a significant association was found with age, mainly due to increased case fatality in subjects >60 years (odds ratio: 4.80 [95% confidence interval 1.64 to 14.04], p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS ECMO may play an important role in critically ill patients with COVID-19 refractory to less invasive treatments. The increased risk of early death in older patients may be used to prioritize ECMO indication in resource-conscious settings, if confirmed externally.",

However, data on the effects of early in-hospital statin exposure are lacking. Therefore, we sought to assess whether (1) early statin exposure during the acute phase after intracerebral haemorrhage and (2) early continuation of prevalent statin use are associated with favourable functional outcome. Patients and methods Data were obtained from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive. Patients were categorised according to use patterns of statins during this early in-hospital phase (continuation, discontinuation or new initiation of statins). Univariate and multivariable analyses were conducted to explore the association between early statin exposure and functional outcome. Results A total of 919 patients were included in the analysis. Early in-hospital statin exposure (n = 89, 9.7%) was associated with better functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale \u2264 3) compared with 790 patients without statin exposure before or early after the event (66% versus 47%, adjusted OR 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.3-3.6). Compared with patients without exposure to statins before and early after the event, early continuation of statin therapy (n = 57) was associated with favourable functional outcome (adjusted odds ratio 2.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-5.2). The association between early continuation of statins and outcome remained robust in sensitivity analyses restricted to patients able to take oral medication within 72 h and one-week survivors. Discussion It is possible that part of the observed associations are not due to a protective effect of statins but are confounded by indication bias. Conclusion Statin exposure and continuation of prevalent statin therapy early after intracerebral haemorrhage are associated with favourable functional outcome after 90 days.",

        "abstract": "Administration of rocuronium to facilitate intubation has traditionally been regarded as acceptable for intraoperative motor evoked potential (MEP) monitoring because of sufficiently rapid spontaneous neuromuscular blockade recovery. We hypothesized that residual neuromuscular blockade, in an amount that could hinder optimal neuromonitoring in patients undergoing intracranial aneurysm clipping, was still present at dural opening. We sought to identify how often this was occurring and to identify factors which may contribute to prolonged blockade. Records of 97 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Rocuronium was administered to facilitate intubation with no additional neuromuscular blockade given. Prolonged spontaneous recovery time to a train-of-four (TOF) ratio of 0.75 after rocuronium administration was defined as 120 min, which was approximately when dural opening and the setting of baseline MEPs were occurring. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors related to prolonged spontaneous recovery time. Prolonged spontaneous recovery time to a TOF ratio of 0.75 was observed in 44.3% of patients. Multivariable analysis showed that only the dosage of rocuronium based on ideal body weight had a positive correlation with prolonged spontaneous recovery time (P = 0.01). There was no significant association between dosage of rocuronium based on total body weight, age, sex, or body temperature and prolonged recovery time. This study demonstrates that the duration of relaxation for MEP monitoring purposes is well-beyond the routinely recognized clinical duration of rocuronium. Residual neuromuscular blockade could result in lower amplitude MEP signals and\/or lead to higher required MEP stimulus intensities which can both compromise monitoring sensitivity.",

The MitraClip should therefore be considered as a tool to achieve this goal in addition to medical therapy. Nowadays, evaluation of patient's candidacy to MitraClip procedure, discussed in local Heart Team, must take into account not only the clinical features of patients but even the experience of the operators and the volume of the centre, which are mostly related to the probability to achieve good procedural results.

Methods Fifty adult patients undergoing elective video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy or pneumonectomy were enrolled. Group 1 patients (n = 25) were first maintained in normocarbia (PaCO2: 38 - 42 mmHg) for 30 min and then in hypercarbia (45 - 50 mmHg). In group 2 patients (n = 25), PaCO2 was maintained in the reverse order. Arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2), respiratory variables, hemodynamic variables, and hemoglobin concentration were compared during normocarbia and hypercarbia. Arterial O2 content and O2 delivery were calculated. Results PaO2 values during normocarbia and hypercarbia were 66.5 \u00b1 10.6 mmHg and 79.7 \u00b1 17.3 mmHg, respectively, (mean difference: 13.2 mmHg, 95% CI for difference of means: 17.0 to 9.3, P < 0.001). SaO2 values during normocarbia and hypercarbia were 92.5 \u00b1 4.8% and 94.3 \u00b1 3.1% (P = 0.009), respectively. Static compliance of the lung (33.0 \u00b1 5.4 vs. 30.4 \u00b1 5.3 mL\/cmH2O, P < 0.001), arterial O2 content (15.4 \u00b1 1.4 vs. 14.9 \u00b1 1.5 mL\/dL, P < 0.001) and O2 delivery (69.9 \u00b1 18.4 vs. 65.1 \u00b1 18.1 mL\/min, P <0.001) were significantly higher during hypercarbia than during normocarbia. Conclusions Hypercarbia increases PaO2 and O2 carrying capacity and improves pulmonary mechanics during OLV, suggesting that it may be helpful to manage oxygenation during OLV. Therefore, permissive hypercarbia may be a simple and valuable modality to manage arterial oxygenation during OLV.",

A total of 187 consecutive patients with acute BAO receiving endovascular treatment (EVT) from January 2012 to July 2018 at the Beijing Tiantan Hospital were recruited in this study. The patients were categorized into three groups: embolism without vertebral artery (VA) steno-occlusion (group 1), in situ atherosclerotic thrombosis (group 2), and embolism from tandem VA steno-occlusion (group 3). Among the 187 patients, 4 patients with embolic combined with ICAS and 1 patient with tandem VA steno-occlusion combined with ICAS were excluded. Of the remaining 182 patients (153 men and 29 women; mean age, 60 years), 43 (23.6%) had embolism without vertebral artery (VA) steno-occlusion (group 1), 116 (63.7%) showed in situ atherosclerotic thrombosis (group 2), and 23 (12.6%) had embolism from tandem VA steno-occlusion (group 3).

DESIGN In vitro study. SETTING Research laboratory. INTERVENTIONS A bench model (normal compliance, no airway resistance) simulating sinusoid flow spontaneous breathing used to calculate imposed work of breathing for various endotracheal tube sizes (3.0-7.5 mm). Imposed work of breathing was calculated by integrating inspiratory tidal volume over the end-expiratory difference between the positive end-expiratory pressure and the tracheal pressure. Measurements were taken at different combinations of set spontaneous tidal volume (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10 mL\/kg), age-appropriate inspiratory times, length of endotracheal tube, and presence of intraluminal catheter. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Overall median imposed work of breathing (Joules\/L) was not significantly different between the four age groups: 0.047 Joules\/L (interquartile range, 0.020-0.074 Joules\/L) for newborns, 0.077 Joules\/L (interquartile range, 0.032-0.127 Joules\/L) for infants, 0.109 Joules\/L (interquartile range, 0.0399-0.193 Joules\/L) for small children, and 0.077 Joules\/L (interquartile range, 0.032-0.132 Joules\/L) for adolescents. Shortening the endotracheal tubes resulted in a significant difference in reduction in overall imposed work of breathing, but the absolute reduction was most notable in small children (0.030 Joules\/L) and the least effect in neonates (0.016 Joules\/L). Overall imposed work of breathing increased in each age group when an intraluminal catheter was in situ: 91.09% increase in imposed work of breathing in neonates to 0.168 Joules\/L, 84.98% in infants to 0.142 Joules\/L, 81.98% in small children to 0.219 Joules\/L, and 55.45% in adolescents to 0.140 Joules\/L. CONCLUSIONS Calculated imposed work of breathing were not different across the range of endotracheal tube sizes. The low imposed work of breathing values found in this study might be appreciated as clinically irrelevant. Our findings add to the change in reasoning that it is appropriate to perform spontaneous breathing trials without pressure support. Nonetheless, our findings on the measured imposed work of breathing values need to be confirmed in a clinical study.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a rapidly progressing inflammatory lung disease with a high mortality rate without specific pharmacological therapy. OBJECTIVES We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on corticosteroid use in ARDS. METHODS A search of four medical literature databases was conducted. We retained randomized trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids in hospitalized adults with ARDS in a search up to February, 2020. Two reviewers identified eligible studies, independently extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Authors assessed the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS We included seven RCTs (n=851 patients). Corticosteroids reduced all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.95, p=0.02, moderate certainty) and duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference [MD] -4.93 days, 95% CI: -7.81 days to -2.06 days, p<0.001, low certainty), and increased ventilator-free days (VFD) (MD 4.28 days, 95% CI: 2.67 days to 5.88 days, p<0.001, moderate certainty), when compared to placebo. Corticosteroids also increased the risk of hyperglycemia (RR 1.12%, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.24, p=0.03, moderate certainty), and the effect on neuromuscular weakness was unclear (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.11, p=0.28, low certainty). CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that systemic corticosteroids may potentially improve mortality, ventilator duration, and VFD in patients with ARDS. However, the studies included different corticosteroid classes and initiated the corticosteroid doses at different times, as well as different dosing regimens. Thus caution in the actual clinical application of these results is recommended.",

For this period, a total of 175,705 procedures were submitted to the registry, 100,446 summarized as heart surgery procedures in a classical sense. The unadjusted in-hospital survival rate for the 34,224 isolated coronary artery bypass grafting procedures (relationship on-\/off-pump 3.8:1) was 97.3%. For the 36,650 isolated heart valve procedures (16,625 transcatheter interventions included), it was 96.4%. Concerning short- and long-term circulatory support, a total of 2,716 extracorporeal life support\/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation implantations, resp. 953 assist device implantations (L-\/ R-\/ BVAD, TAH) were registered. In 2019, the number of isolated heart transplantations increased to 333, a rise of 6.7% compared to the previous year. The isolated lung transplantations amounted to 311, a decrease of 8.5%.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Whereas ICU-acquired weakness may delay extubation in mechanically ventilated patients, its influence on extubation failure is poorly known. This study aimed at assessing the role of ICU-acquired weakness on extubation failure and the relation between limb weakness and cough strength. METHODS A secondary analysis of two previous prospective studies including patients at high risk of reintubation after a planned extubation, i.e., age greater than 65 years, with underlying cardiac or respiratory disease, or intubated for more than 7 days prior to extubation. Patients intubated less than 24 h and those with a do-not-reintubate order were not included. Limb and cough strength were assessed by a physiotherapist just before extubation. ICU-acquired weakness was clinically diagnosed as limb weakness defined as Medical Research Council (MRC) score < 48 points and severe weakness as MRC sum-score < 36. Cough strength was assessed using a semi-quantitative 5-Likert scale. Extubation failure was defined as reintubation or death within the first 7 days following extubation. RESULTS Among 344 patients at high risk of reintubation, 16% experienced extubation failure (56\/344). They had greater severity and lower MRC sum-score (41 \u00b1 16 vs. 49 \u00b1 13, p < 0.001) and were more likely to have ineffective cough than the others. The prevalence of ICU-acquired weakness at the time of extubation was 38% (130\/244). The extubation failure rate was 12% (25\/214) in patients with no limb weakness vs. 18% (12\/65) and 29% (19\/65) in those with moderate and severe limb weakness, respectively (p < 0.01). MRC sum-score and cough strength were weakly but significantly correlated (rho = 0.28, p < .001). After multivariate logistic regression analyses, the lower the MRC sum-score the greater the risk of reintubation; severe limb weakness was independently associated with extubation failure, even after adjustment on cough strength and severity at admission. CONCLUSION ICU-acquired weakness was diagnosed in 38% in this population of patients at high risk at the time of extubation and was independently associated with extubation failure in the ICU.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The use of shared ventilation, or the simultaneous support of multiple patients connected in parallel to a single mechanical ventilator, is receiving considerable interest for addressing the severe shortage of mechanical ventilators available during the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). In this paper we highlight the potentially disastrous consequences of na\u00efve shared ventilation, in which patients are simply connected in parallel to a ventilator without any regard to their individual ventilatory requirements. We then examine possible approaches for individualization of mechanical ventilation, using modifications to the breathing circuit that may enable tuning of individual tidal volumes and driving pressures during either volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) or pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV). METHODS Breathing circuit modifications included a PEEP valve on each expiratory limb for both VCV and PCV, an adjustable constriction and one-way valve on the inspiratory limb for VCV, and a pressure relief valve for peak-inspiratory pressure reduction on the inspiratory limb for PCV. The ability to regulate individual tidal volumes using these breathing circuit modifications was tested both theoretically in computer simulations as well as experimentally in mechanical test lungs. RESULTS In both the simulations and experimental measurements, na\u00efve shared ventilation resulted in large imbalances across individual tidal volume delivery, dependent on imbalances across patient mechanical properties. The proposed breathing circuit modifications for shared VCV and shared PCV enabled optimization of tidal volume distributions. Individual tidal volume for one patient during shared VCV was sensitive to changes in the mechanical properties of other patients. By contrast, shared PCV enabled independent control of individual patient received ventilation. CONCLUSIONS Of the shared ventilation strategies considered, shared PCV, with the inclusion of in-line pressure relief valves in the individual inspiratory and expiratory limbs, offers the greatest degree of safety and lowest risk of catastrophic mechanical interactions between multiple patients connected to a single ventilator.",

This study aimed to identify predictors of failed reperfusion. METHODS In this study 2211 patients from the German Stroke Registry who received EVT for anterior circulation stroke were retrospectively analyzed. Failure of reperfusion was defined as thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) grades 0\/1\/2a, and sufficient reperfusion as TICI 2b\/3. In 1629 patients with complete datasets, associations between failure of reperfusion and baseline clinical data, comorbidities, location of occlusion, and procedural data were assessed with multiple logistic regression. RESULTS Failure of reperfusion occurred in 371 patients (16.8%) and was associated with the following locations of occlusion: cervical internal carotid artery (ICA, adjusted odds ratio, OR 2.01, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.08-3.69), intracranial ICA without carotid T occlusion (adjusted OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.05-2.98), and M2 segment (adjusted OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.21-2.84). Failed reperfusion was also associated with cervical ICA stenosis (>70% stenosis, adjusted OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.69-4.97), stroke of other determined etiology by TOAST (Trial of ORG 10172 in acute stroke treatment) criteria (e.g. nonatherosclerotic vasculopathies, adjusted OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.36-5.39), and treatment given outside the usual working hours (adjusted OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.07-1.86). Successful reperfusion was associated with higher Alberta stroke program early CT score (ASPECTS) on initial imaging (adjusted OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79-0.92), treatment with the patient under general anesthesia (adjusted OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54-0.96), and concomitant ICA stenting in patients with ICA stenosis (adjusted OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.11-0.38). CONCLUSION Several factors are associated with failure of reperfusion, most notably occlusions of the proximal ICA and low ASPECTS on admission.

        "abstract": "Background One-lung ventilation (OLV) is becoming an essential component of thoracic anesthesia. The two principal devices used for OLV are a double-lumen tube (DLT) and a bronchial blocker (BB). We hypothesized that the use of a BB with the disconnection technique would improve the quality of lung collapse in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Methods Seventy-five patients undergoing scheduled VATS were enrolled in this study and were randomly divided into two groups: a left-sided DLT group (Group D) and a BB with the disconnection technique group (Group B). OLV was initiated when the surgeon performed the skin incision. In Group D, the left channel of the DLT was opened to the air. In Group B, the lung was deflated via the disconnection technique, thus opening the breathing circuit to the air fifteen seconds after opening the pleura. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) during induction; the quality of lung collapse 1 and 10 minutes after pleural opening; the time required for complete lung collapse; the correct placement of the device; and the number of patients suffering from a sore throat after surgery were recorded. Results Compared with the use of the DLT, the use of the BB with the disconnection technique was associated with a similar quality of lung collapse, a comparable required time for total lung collapse (P>0.05, respectively), a lower incidence of sore throat both when leaving the PACU and 24 hours after surgery (34.2% vs. 13.5%, 15.8% vs. 5.4%, P<0.05, respectively) and fewer hemodynamic fluctuations after intubation both one and ten minutes after pleural opening. Conclusions The use of a BB with the disconnection technique in VATS offers an effective method for improving the quality of lung collapse and reducing postoperative sore throat.",

Anticipating a need for such therapies during the pandemic, our center created a targeted protocol for ECMO therapy in COVID-19 patients that allows us to provide this life-saving therapy to our sickest patients without overburdening already stretched resources or excessively exposing healthcare staff to infection risk. METHODS As a major regional referral program, we used the framework of our well-established ECMO service-line to outline specific team structures, modified patient eligibility criteria, cannulation strategies, and management protocols for the COVID-19 ECMO program. RESULTS During the first month of the COVID-19 outbreak in Massachusetts, 6 patients were placed on VV ECMO for refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure. The median (interquartile range) age was 47 years (43-53) with most patients being male (83%) and obese (67%). All cannulations were performed at the bedside in the intensive care unit in patients who had undergone a trial of rescue therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome including lung protective ventilation, paralysis, prone positioning, and inhaled nitric oxide. At the time of this report, 83% (5\/6) of the patients are still alive with 1 death on ECMO, attributed to hemorrhagic stroke. 67% of patients (4\/6) have been successfully decannulated, including 2 that have been successfully extubated and one who was discharged from the hospital. The median duration of VV ECMO therapy for patients who have been decannulated is 12 days (4-18 days). CONCLUSIONS This is 1 the first case series describing VV ECMO outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Our initial data suggest that VV ECMO can be successfully utilized in appropriately selected COVID-19 patients with advanced respiratory failure.",

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the impact of passive peritoneal drainage on achieving negative fluid balance and its ability to dispose of inflammatory cytokines. METHODS From September 2014 to November 2016, infants undergoing STAT category 3, 4, and 5 operations were randomized to receive or not receive intraoperative prophylactic peritoneal drain. We analyzed time to negative fluid balance and perioperative variables for each group. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were measured from serum and peritoneal fluid in the passive peritoneal drainage group and serum in the control group postoperatively. RESULTS Infants were randomized to prophylactic passive peritoneal drain group (n = 13) and control (n = 12). The groups were not significantly different in pre- and postoperative peak lactate levels, postoperative length of stay, and mortality. Peritoneal drain patients reached time to negative fluid balance at a median of 1.42 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.00-2.91), whereas the control at 3.08 (IQR: 1.67-3.88; P = .043).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND The assessment of diaphragm function with diaphragm ultrasound seems to bring important clinical information to describe diaphragm work and weakness. When the diaphragm is weak, extradiaphragmatic muscles may play an important role, but whether ultrasound can also assess their activity and function is unknown. This study aimed to (1) evaluate the feasibility of measuring the thickening of the parasternal intercostal and investigate the responsiveness of this muscle to assisted ventilation; and (2) evaluate whether a combined evaluation of the parasternal and the diaphragm could predict failure of a spontaneous breathing trial. METHODS First, an exploratory evaluation of the parasternal in 23 healthy subjects. Second, the responsiveness of parasternal to several pressure support levels were studied in 16 patients. Last, parasternal activity was compared in presence or absence of diaphragm dysfunction (assessed by magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerves and ultrasound) and in case of success\/failure of a spontaneous breathing trial in 54 patients. RESULTS The parasternal was easily accessible in all patients. The interobserver reproducibility was good (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.77 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.89). There was a progressive decrease in parasternal muscle thickening fraction with increasing levels of pressure support (Spearman \u03c1 = -0.61 [95% CI, -0.74 to -0.44]; P < 0.0001) and an inverse correlation between parasternal muscle thickening fraction and the pressure generating capacity of the diaphragm (Spearman \u03c1 = -0.79 [95% CI, -0.87 to -0.66]; P < 0.0001). The parasternal muscle thickening fraction was higher in patients with diaphragm dysfunction: 17% (10 to 25) versus 5% (3 to 8), P < 0.0001. The pressure generating capacity of the diaphragm, the diaphragm thickening fraction and the parasternal thickening fraction similarly predicted failure or the spontaneous breathing trial. CONCLUSIONS Ultrasound assessment of the parasternal intercostal muscle is feasible in the intensive care unit and provides novel information regarding the respiratory capacity load balance. : WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: Ultrasound can be used to assess work (i.e., function) and weakness of the diaphragm. This can be helpful in predicting difficulty in weaning patients from mechanical ventilation.Patients who have weakness of the diaphragm may compensate with parasternal muscle activity. However, the feasibility of measuring parasternal intercostal muscle thickening with ultrasound and the ability of these measures to be combined with ultrasound evaluation of the diaphragm in order to predict ability to wean from mechanical ventilation has not been well explored. WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW Parasternal intercostal muscle thickness can be measured with ultrasound with good interobserver reproducibility.Parasternal intercostal muscle thickening was responsive to the level of ventilator assistance and significantly higher (i.e., increased) in mechanically ventilated patients with diaphragm dysfunction.The pressure-generating capacity of the diaphragm, the diaphragm-thickening fraction, and the parasternal intercostal muscle-thickening fraction were all significantly associated with failure of a spontaneous breathing trial in mechanically ventilated patients.",

An educational program was then completed that involved training our anesthesia providers about complications related to excessive cuff pressure and how to utilize a quantitative cuff pressure measurement device (manometer). The impact of this educational initiative was assessed by comparing the incidence of postoperative complications associated with the use of airway devices before and after the training period. METHODS After approval by our institution's Institutional Review Board, a pre-intervention (baseline) survey was obtained from 259 adult patients after having undergone surgery with general anesthesia with the use of an endotracheal tube (ETT) or laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Survey responses were used to determine the baseline incidence of sore throat, hoarseness, and dysphagia. Once these results were obtained, education was provided to the anesthesia department members addressing the complications associated with excessive cuff pressures, appropriate cuff pressures based on manufacturer recommendations, and instructions on the use of a quantitative monitor to determine cuff pressure (manometry). Clinical care was then changed by requiring intraoperative cuff pressure monitoring throughout our institution for all surgical patients. After this educational period, 299 patients completed the same survey describing postoperative airway complications. RESULTS The use of manometry reduced the incidence of moderate-to-severe postoperative sore throat in the pre- vs. post-intervention groups (35 patients vs 31 patients, p = 0.045), moderate to severe hoarseness (30 patients vs 13, patients p = 0.0001), and moderate-to-severe dysphagia (13 patients vs 5 patients, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION Caring for patients in the perioperative setting frequently entails placement of an airway device. This procedure is associated with several potential complications, including sore throat, coughing, and vocal cord damage. Our quality improvement initiative has shown that intraoperative management of intra-cuff pressure based on manometry is feasible to implement in clinical practice and can reduce postoperative airway complications.",

This study is to summarize the clinical features, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation characteristics, and outcomes of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. DESIGN Descriptive study from two hospitals. SETTING The ICUs from university hospitals. PATIENTS Patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia received mechanical ventilation, including those underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from January 8, 2020, to March 31, 2020. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Clinical records, laboratory results, ventilator parameters, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-related data were abstracted from the medical records. One-hundred twenty-nine critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia were admitted to ICU of the two referral hospitals. Fifty-nine patients received mechanical ventilation and 21 of them received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (fourteen from Zhongnan hospital and seven from Wuhan pulmonary hospital). Compared to mechanical ventilation patients without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, there was a tendency of decline in mortality but with no significant difference (no-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group 24\/38 [63.2%] vs extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group 12\/21 [57.1%]; p = 0.782). For those patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 12 patients died and nine survived by April 7, 2020. Among extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients, the PaCO2 prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was lower (54.40 mm Hg [29.20-57.50 mm Hg] vs 63.20 mm Hg [55.40-72.12 mm Hg]; p = 0.006), and pH prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was higher (7.38 [7.28-7.48] vs 7.23 [7.16-7.33]; p = 0.023) in survivors than nonsurvivors. CONCLUSIONS Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation might be an effective salvage treatment for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia associated with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.

        "abstract": "WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC Transpulmonary driving pressure (ratio of tidal volume to respiratory system compliance) increases with increased intraabdominal pressure during laparoscopic surgery. High transpulmonary driving pressure during laparoscopic surgery is associated with increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications.Intraoperative positive end-expiratory pressure prevents atelectasis, but may also cause overdistension. WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW This single-center study found that titrating intraoperative positive end-expiratory pressure in relation to observed intraabdominal pressure may counterbalance pneumoperitoneum-related rises in transpulmonary driving pressure during laparoscopic cholecystectomies. BACKGROUND Pneumoperitoneum for laparoscopic surgery is associated with a rise of driving pressure. The authors aimed to assess the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on driving pressure at varying intraabdominal pressure levels. It was hypothesized that PEEP attenuates pneumoperitoneum-related rises in driving pressure. METHODS Open-label, nonrandomized, crossover, clinical trial in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. \"Targeted PEEP\" (2 cm H2O above intraabdominal pressure) was compared with \"standard PEEP\" (5 cm H2O), with respect to the transpulmonary and respiratory system driving pressure at three predefined intraabdominal pressure levels, and each patient was ventilated with two levels of PEEP at the three intraabdominal pressure levels in the same sequence. The primary outcome was the difference in transpulmonary driving pressure between targeted PEEP and standard PEEP at the three levels of intraabdominal pressure. RESULTS Thirty patients were included and analyzed. Targeted PEEP was 10, 14, and 17 cm H2O at intraabdominal pressure of 8, 12, and 15 mmHg, respectively. Compared to standard PEEP, targeted PEEP resulted in lower median transpulmonary driving pressure at intraabdominal pressure of 8 mmHg (7 [5 to 8] vs. 9 [7 to 11] cm H2O; P = 0.010; difference 2 [95% CI 0.5 to 4 cm H2O]); 12 mmHg (7 [4 to 9] vs.10 [7 to 12] cm H2O; P = 0.002; difference 3 [1 to 5] cm H2O); and 15 mmHg (7 [6 to 9] vs.12 [8 to 15] cm H2O; P < 0.001; difference 4 [2 to 6] cm H2O). The effects of targeted PEEP compared to standard PEEP on respiratory system driving pressure were comparable to the effects on transpulmonary driving pressure, though respiratory system driving pressure was higher than transpulmonary driving pressure at all intraabdominal pressure levels. CONCLUSIONS Transpulmonary driving pressure rises with an increase in intraabdominal pressure, an effect that can be counterbalanced by targeted PEEP. Future studies have to elucidate which combination of PEEP and intraabdominal pressure is best in term of clinical outcomes.",

We planned to perform transarterial Onyx embolization using a short-length sinus protection balloon to protect against Onyx migration. During transarterial Onyx injection, a 7 \u00d7 7-mm HyperForm balloon was navigated into the affected sinus and positioned to cover the drainage channel from the shunt. After confirming the change in Borden classification with angiography, transarterial Onyx embolization was performed via the middle meningeal artery. This procedure resulted in complete obliteration of the fistula with good patency of both the transverse-sigmoid sinus and neighboring normal cortical veins.

Peripheral arterial calcification reduces acute success and long-term patency of endovascular therapy for PAD. Several calcium modification devices are available for use in peripheral interventions. Outcomes after peripheral intravascular lithotripsy (IVL), a novel approach using pulsatile sonic waves to treat luminal and medial calcium in patients with PAD, have not been extensively characterized. Therefore, we sought to perform an individual patient-level data (IPD) pooled analysis of available studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IVL in the treatment of PAD. METHODS AND RESULTS We pooled IPD, including baseline and procedural variables, from five prospective studies which assessed IVL in the treatment of patients with extensive peripheral artery calcification. Final postprocedural percent diameter stenosis (%DS) and procedural angiographic complications were assessed by independent core laboratory. Efficacy endpoints were analyzed using linear mixed effects models and safety endpoints were tabulated overall and by vascular bed. Among 336 patients who underwent endovascular revascularization with use of IVL, there was a significant reduction between pre-procedural and final %DS of 55.1% (95% confidence interval 53.3-57.0%, p < .0001). Core-laboratory assessed lesion-level complications, including flow-limiting dissections (Types D-F), vessel perforation, distal embolization, thrombus, abrupt closure, and no reflow, occurred in 4\/328 (1.22%) of treated lesions.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND The Trachway Videolight Intubating Stylet is a video-assisted system with a rigid but malleable intubating stylet that facilitates endotracheal intubation. Minimizing cervical spine movement with manual in-line stabilization is essential for patients with cervical spine injuries such as multiple trauma. However, the intubation time of the Trachway Videolight Intubating Stylet and complications associated with intubation in patients with manual in-line stabilization in the neutral-head and head-lift positions remain unclear. METHODS Patients (20-80 years old) who were scheduled to undergo surgery that required general anesthesia with tracheal intubation were randomly allocated to either a neutral-head (n = 62) or a head-lift position (n = 62) group. Manual in-line stabilization was performed to limit cervical spine mobility. We aimed to evaluate orotracheal intubation time and success rate in these 2 positions with the Trachway Videolight Intubating Stylet. RESULTS Intubation was faster in the head-lift than in the neutral-head position (20 \u00b1 10 and 25 \u00b1 13 seconds, respectively, P = .000); intubation was equally successful in the 2 positions (96.8% vs 96.8%). Responses to intubation did not differ between positions (heart rate, P = .142; visual analog scale scores for throat soreness, P = .54). The only significant predictor of intubation time was the body mass index in the head-lift position group (P = .005). CONCLUSIONS Intubation using the Trachway Videolight Intubating Stylet with manual in-line stabilization is faster in the head-lift position, and therefore preferable. However, if the head-lift position is not suitable, the neutral-head position is a sensible alternative, with comparable intubation success rate, heart rate change, and postoperative throat soreness.",

METHODS Between 1997 and 2018, a total of 449 patients {372 males; mean age 54.2 [standard deviation (SD) 15.2] years, range: 12.7-79.9 years} underwent elective valve-sparing aortic root replacement (David procedure) for aortic regurgitation and were prospectively followed up clinically and echocardiographically. RESULTS The follow-up was 94% complete. Cumulative follow-up time was 2268 patient-years [mean follow-up time 5.1 (4.3 SD) years]. Thirty-day mortality was 2.2% (n = 10). Late (>30 days) survival did not differ from that of the age- and gender-matched general population. Freedom from reoperation in patients without additional cusp reconstruction was 94% [95% confidence interval (CI) 91-98] and 92% (95% CI 88-97) at 5 and 10 years, respectively, which was not significantly different (P = 1) for patients who did require additional cusp reconstruction 98% (95% CI 95-100) and 89% (95% CI 81-99). In patients with tricuspid aortic valves (n = 338), freedom from reoperation was 96% (95% CI 94-99) and 93% (95% CI 88-97) at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Patients with bicuspid aortic valves (n = 111) had a freedom from reoperation of 94% (95% CI 89-99) at 5 years and 88% (95% CI 79-98) at 10 years (P = 0.021 for the comparison to tricuspid aortic valve). Overall, 23 patients (5%; 1%\/patient-year) required reoperation with a mean interval of 4.5 (4.8 SD) months.

METHODS Clinical data of patients with severe H1N1 influenza virus pneumonia implemented by ECMO in the First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College from October 2018 to December 2019 were retrospective analyzed, including general information, ECMO transport distance, time, clinical parameters before and after ECMO, including the patients' oxygenation index (PaO2\/FiO2), respiratory rate (RR), pulse blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), arterial blood carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2), and pH value, various complications during transport, mechanical ventilation time, patients' prognosis and other indicators. Experience from the aspects of personal protection, transport process and equipment, team cooperation, mid-transit monitoring, quality control, etc., was summarized to provide suggestions for patients with severe COVID-19 using ECMO during inter-hospital transport and protection. RESULTS A total of 6 patients with severe H1N1 influenza virus pneumonia were transported on ECMO. All patients were transported to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College by the ECMO transport team after the establishment of ECMO in the local hospital. The transfer distance was 11 to 197 km, with an average of (93.8\u00b158.6) km; the transfer time was 30 to 150 minutes, with an average of (79.2\u00b140.6) minutes. Two patients experienced a drop in ECMO flow and SpO2 during the process, and the main reason was insufficient volume, which was improved after fluid resuscitation and posture adjustment. All patients maintained SpO2 above 0.93. Six patients survived and were discharged. ECMO assisted time was 4-9 days, with an average of (6.5\u00b11.5) days; mechanical ventilation time was 7-24 days, and median time was 10.0 (8.0, 14.5) days. No H1N1 transmission occurred in medical personnel. To achieve good therapeutic effect, the main experience was to choose the proper timing and mode of ECMO; intact transportation vehicles and equipment to reduce or avoid mechanical complications; the effective management of respiration and circulation during the transportation to avoid ventilation-associated lung injury (VALI) and serious hypoxemia; the appropriate space for the transfer team to quickly handle various critical situations; and personal protection to avoid infection. CONCLUSIONS With an experienced ECMO transport team, good transport equipment, comprehensive protection measures, reasonable transport procedures, and a perfect emergency plan, it is safe to use ECMO transport for COVID-19 patients.",

Methods and Results We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with large vessel occlusion who were treated with rescue stent angioplasty after stent-retriever thrombectomy between 2012 and 2018 in 7 neurovascular centers. We defined 2 binary outcomes: (1) functional clinical outcome (good modified Rankin Scale, 0-2; and poor modified Rankin Scale, 4-6) and (2) early symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Impacts of clinical, radiological, and interventional parameters on outcomewere assessed in uni- and multivariable logistic regression models. Two hundred ten patients were included with target vessels located within the anterior circulation (136 of 210; 64.8%) and posterior circulation (74 of 210; 35.2%). Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occured in 22 patients, 86.4% (19 of 22) after anterior and 13.6% (3 of 22) after posterior circulation large vessel occlusion. Good functional outcome was observed in 44.8% (73 of 163). A higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale on admission (adjusted odds ratio, 1.10; P=0.002), a higher premorbid modified Rankin Scale (adjusted odds ratio, 2.02; P=0.049), and a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 0 to 2a after stenting (adjusted odds ratio, 23.24; P<0.001) were independent predictors of poor functional outcome.

        "doi": "10.1161\/strokeaha.119.027512",
        "abstract": "Background and Purpose- Patients with acute ischemic stroke who have large vessel occlusion benefit from direct transport to a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) capable of endovascular therapy. To avoid harm for patients without large vessel occlusion from delayed access to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), it has been suggested to only redirect patients with high likelihood of large vessel occlusion for whom the additional delay to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) caused by transport to the CSC is below a certain threshold. However, which threshold achieves the greatest clinical benefit is unknown. Methods- We used mathematical modeling to calculate additional-delay-to-IVT thresholds associated with the greatest reduction in disability-adjusted life years in abstracted 2-stroke center and multiple-stroke center scenarios. Model parameters were extracted from recent meta-analyses or large prospective cohort studies. Uncertainty was quantified in probabilistic and 2-way univariate sensitivity analyses. Results- Assuming ideal treatment time performance metrics, transport to the nearest CSC was the preferred strategy irrespective of additional delay-to-IVT when the transfer time between primary stroke center and CSC was <40 minutes (95% credible interval: 25-66 minutes); otherwise, the optimal additional delay-to-IVT-threshold ranged from 28 to 139 minutes. In multiple-stroke center scenarios, optimal additional-delay-to-IVT thresholds were 30 to 54 minutes in urban and 49 to 141 minutes in rural settings; use of optimal thresholds as compared with a 15 minute-threshold saved 0 to 0.11 and 0 to 0.37 disability-adjusted life years per triage case, respectively. Assuming slower treatment times at primary stroke centers and CSCs yielded longer permissible additional delays. Conclusions- Our results suggest that patients with acute ischemic stroke with suspected large vessel occlusion should be redirected to a CSC if the additional delay to IVT is <30 minutes in urban and 50 minutes in rural settings.",

METHODS A comprehensive search comprising studies from Medline, Cochrane, Embase and PsycINFO published from 1988 to 2019 will be conducted. We will include studies on children \u226418 years old who suffer from mild, moderate and severe TBI as determined by the Glasgow Coma Scale that report neurocognitive outcomes in domains predetermined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition criteria. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomised controlled trials, case-control, cohort and cross-sectional studies will be included. References from systematic reviews and meta-analyses will be hand-searched for relevant articles. A meta-analysis will be performed and effect sizes will be calculated to summarise the magnitude of change in each neurocognitive domain compared at different timepoints and stratified by severity of TBI. Included studies will be pooled using pooled standardised mean differences with a random effects model to determine an overall effect. In the scenario that we are unable to pool the studies, we will perform a narrative analysis.

Wavelet methodology had less index variability with smaller standard deviations. Both wavelet and correlation methods distinguished functional autoregulation (ABP above LLA) from dysfunctional autoregulation (ABP below the LLA).

RESULTS The review identified 3 patients (2 female), with 3 unruptured aneurysms, of average age 67 \u00b1 8.7 years (range 62-77 years). The aneurysms were all located in the anterior circulation including one pericallosal, one at the A1-2 junction and one on the ICA bifurcation. The mean average dome height was 7.6 \u00b1 0.62 mm (range 7.1-8.3 mm), dome width 5.7 \u00b1 2 mm (range 3.5-7.5 mm), and neck width 3.6 \u00b1 0.95 mm (range 2.5-4.2 mm). At follow-up angiography two of the aneurysms were completely occluded and one device had displaced into the aneurysm sac due to inappropriate positioning of the device. Of the patients one had minor stroke during the postoperative period but returned to baseline neurology. All patients were mRS 0 at last follow-up.

METHODS Thirty-six patients scheduled to undergo transurethral surgery under spinal anesthesia were randomly assigned to the dexmedetomidine (n = 18) and propofol groups (n = 18). We used near-infrared spectroscopy sensors to measure rSO2, and obtained data from each side were averaged. After oxygen insufflation, baseline measurements of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate, rSO2, pulse oximetry saturation (SpO2), bispectral index, and body temperature were made. After spinal anesthesia, we measured these parameters every 5 min. Twenty minutes after spinal injection, dexmedetomidine or propofol administration was started. We measured each parameter at 10, 25, and 40 min after the administration of dexmedetomidine or propofol. RESULTS The baseline rSO2 in the dexmedetomidine group was 71.3 \u00b1 7.3%, and that in the propofol group was 71.8 \u00b1 5.6%. After spinal anesthesia, rSO2 in both groups decreased significantly (dexmedetomidine group: 65.4 \u00b1 6.9%; propofol group: 64.3 \u00b1 7.4%). After administering sedatives, rSO2 was equivalent after spinal anesthesia. rSO2 was comparable between the two groups. MAP and SpO2 were significantly higher in the dexmedetomidine group than in the propofol group. CONCLUSION Spinal anesthesia decreased rSO2; however, the decline was not severe. Dexmedetomidine and propofol did not compromise cerebral oxygenation under spinal anesthesia. Nevertheless, MAP and SpO2 were more stable in dexmedetomidine sedation than in propofol sedation.

Additionally, PbtO2 signals have been used to derive indices thought to be associated with cerebrovascular reactivity in TBI. However, their true relationship to slow-wave vasogenic fluctuations associated with cerebral autoregulation remains unclear. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between slow-wave fluctuations of intracranial pressure (ICP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and PbtO2 over time. Using the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) high resolution ICU sub-study cohort, we evaluated those patients with recorded high-frequency digital intra-parenchymal ICP and PbtO2 monitoring data of a minimum of 6 h in duration. Digital physiologic signals were processed for ICP, MAP, and PbtO2 slow-waves using a moving average filter to decimate the high-frequency signal. The first 5 days of recording were analyzed. The relationship between ICP, MAP and PbtO2 slow-waves over time were assessed using autoregressive integrative moving average (ARIMA) and vector autoregressive integrative moving average (VARIMA) modelling, as well as Granger causality testing. A total of 47 patients were included. The ARIMA structure of ICP and MAP were similar in time, where PbtO2 displayed different optimal structure. VARIMA modelling and IRF plots confirmed the strong directional relationship between MAP and ICP, demonstrating an ICP response to MAP impulse. PbtO2 slow-waves, however, failed to demonstrate a definite response to ICP and MAP slow-wave impulses. These results raise questions as to the utility of PbtO2 in the derivation of cerebrovascular reactivity measures in TBI. There is a reproducible relationship between slow-wave fluctuations of ICP and MAP, as demonstrated across various time-series analytic techniques. PbtO2 does not appear to reliably respond in time to slow-wave fluctuations in MAP, as demonstrated on various VARIMA models across all patients. These findings suggest that PbtO2 should not be utilized in the derivation of cerebrovascular reactivity metrics in TBI, as it does not appear to be responsive to changes in MAP in the slow-waves. These findings corroborate previous results regarding PbtO2 based cerebrovascular reactivity indices.",

This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of subarachnoid anesthesia combined with propofol target-controlled infusion (TCI) on blood loss and transfusion for total hip arthroplasty (THA) in elderly patients in comparison with combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSEA) or GA. METHODS Totally, 240 patients (aged \u226565 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] I-III) scheduled for posterior THA were enrolled from September 1st, 2017 to March 1st, 2018. All cases were randomly divided into three groups to receive CSEA (group C, n = 80), GA (group G, n = 80), or subarachnoid anesthesia and propofol TCI (group T, n = 80), respectively. Primary outcomes measured were intra-operative blood loss, autologous and allogeneic blood transfusion, mean arterial pressure at different time points, length of stay in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), length of hospital stay, and patient satisfaction degree. Furthermore, post-operative pain scores and complications were also observed. The difference of quantitative index between groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, repeated measurement generalized linear model, Student-Newman-Keuls test or rank-sum test, while ratio index was analyzed by Chi-square test or Fisher exact test. RESULTS Basic characteristics were comparable among the three groups. Intra-operative blood loss in group T (331.53 \u00b1 64.33 mL) and group G (308.03 \u00b1 64.90 mL) were significantly less than group C (455.40 \u00b1 120.48 mL, F = 65.80, P < 0.001). Similarly, the autologous transfusion of group T (130.99 \u00b1 30.36 mL) and group G (124.09 \u00b1 24.34 mL) were also markedly less than group C (178.31 \u00b1 48.68 mL, F = 52.99, P < 0.001). The allogenetic blood transfusion of group C (0 [0, 100.00]) was also significantly larger than group T (0) and group G (0) (Z = 2.47, P = 0.047). Except for the baseline, there were significant differences in mean arterial blood pressures before operation (F = 496.84, P < 0.001), 10-min after the beginning of operation (F = 351.43, P < 0.001), 30-min after the beginning of operation (F = 559.89, P < 0.001), 50-min after the beginning of operation (F = 374.74, P < 0.001), and at the end of operation (F = 26.14, P < 0.001) among the three groups. Length of stay in PACU of group T (9.41 \u00b1 1.19 min) was comparable with group C (8.83 \u00b1 1.26 min), and both were significantly shorter than group G (16.55 \u00b1 3.10 min, F = 352.50, P < 0.001). There were no significant differences among the three groups in terms of length of hospitalization and post-operative visual analog scale scores. Patient satisfaction degree of group T (77\/80) was significantly higher than group C (66\/80, \u03c7 = 7.96, P = 0.004) and G (69\/80, \u03c7 = 5.01, P = 0.025). One patient complained of post-dural puncture headache and two complained of low back pain in group C, while none in group T. Incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting in group G (10\/80) was significantly higher than group T (3\/80, \u03c7 = 4.10, P = 0.043) and group C (2\/80, \u03c7 = 5.76, P = 0.016). No deep vein thrombosis or delayed post-operative functional exercise was detected. CONCLUSIONS Single subarachnoid anesthesia combined with propofol TCI seems to perform better than CSEA and GA for posterior THA in elderly patients, with less blood loss and peri-operative transfusion, higher patient satisfaction degree and fewer complications.

Outcome was analysed according to primary intended therapy. RESULTS Among 185 patients (median age 67.4 years), 52.4% received primary conservative therapy (including 26.8% secondary reperfusion in case of secondary neurological deterioration), 12.4% IV thrombolysis (IVT) only and 35.1% primary endovascular therapy (EVT). 95 (51.4%) patients experienced neurological deterioration until 3 months. Primary-IVT-only and primary-EVT compared to conservative-therapy patients had better 3 months' outcome (54.5% vs. 30.8%: adjustedOR 6.02; adjustedp = 0.004 for mRS 0-1 and 54.7% vs. 30.8%: adjustedOR 5.09; adjustedp = 0.002, respectively). Also mRS shift analysis favored primary-IVT-only and primary-EVT patients (adjustedOR 6.25; adjustedp = 0.001 and adjustedOR 3.14; adjustedp = 0.003). Outcome in primary-IVT-only vs. primary-EVT patients did not differ significantly. Patients who received secondary EVT because of neurological deterioration after primary-conservative-therapy had worse 3 months' outcome than primary-EVT patients (20.8% vs. 30.8%: adjustedOR 0.24; adjustedp = 0.047 for mRS 0-1 and adjustedOR 0.31; adjustedp = 0.019 in mRS shift analysis).

CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate that primary IVT and\/or EVT may be better than primary conservative therapy in patients with LVO in the anterior circulation and low NIHSS score.

DESIGN We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane for studies involving the use of methylene blue for catecholamine-refractory shock from database inception to 2019. Collected studies were analyzed qualitatively. To describe practice patterns of methylene blue use, we electronically distributed a survey to U.S.-based pediatric critical care physicians. We assessed physician knowledge and experience with methylene blue. Survey responses were quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated. SETTING Pediatric critical and cardiac care units. PATIENTS OR SUBJECTS Patients less than or equal to 25 years old with refractory shock treated with methylene blue. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS One-thousand two-hundred ninety-three abstracts met search criteria, 139 articles underwent full-text review, and 24 studies were included. Studies investigated refractory shock induced by a variety of etiologies and found that methylene blue was generally safe and increased mean arterial blood pressure. There is overall lack of studies, low number of study patients, and low quality of studies identified. Our survey had a 22.5% response rate, representing 125 institutions. Similar proportions of physicians reported using (40%) or never even considering (43%) methylene blue for shock. The most common reasons for not using methylene blue were unfamiliarity with this drug, its proper dosing, and lack of evidentiary support. CONCLUSIONS Methylene blue appears safe and may benefit children with refractory shock. There is a stark divide in familiarity and practice patterns regarding its use among physicians.

We aimed to investigate the clinical and radiological outcomes of treating recurrent sCA. We retrospectively evaluated the data of 52 patients with 60 recurrent sCAs who were retreated and 1534 patients with 1817 sCAs who received initial treatment. The primary outcome was a recurrence of the aneurysm. Secondary outcomes were an additional treatment, rupture after treatment, and a neurological worsening, which was defined as an increase of 1 or more scores using the modified Rankin Scale at 12-month. Safety outcomes included postoperative ischemic and hemorrhagic complications. We compiled the 120 (60 each) propensity score-matched cohort based on a propensity score for the treatment of recurrent sCA. In the propensity score-matched cohort, recurrence after treatment was observed in 25% and 6.7% of cases in the retreatment and initial treatment groups, respectively. The odds ratio of recurrence after treatment was 4.7 (95% CI, 1.4-15; P = 0.011). The secondary and safety outcomes were not significantly different between the two groups.

DESIGN Confidential, self-administered questionnaire. SETTING One hundred twenty-seven U.S. pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation centers. SUBJECTS Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation center program directors and coordinators. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS In March 2020, a survey was sent to 127 pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation centers asking them to report their current hospital extracorporeal membrane oxygenation guidelines for coronavirus disease 2019-positive patients. Respondents were also asked their opinion on three ethical dilemmas including: prioritization of children over adults for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use, institution of do-not-resuscitate orders, and the use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for coronavirus disease 2019-positive patients. Forty-seven extracorporeal membrane oxygenation centers had enacted guidelines including 46 (100%) that offer venovenous-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and 42 (89%) that offer venoarterial-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for coronavirus disease 2019-positive pediatric patients. Forty-four centers (94%) stated that the indications for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation candidacy in coronavirus disease 2019 disease were similar to those used in other viral illnesses, such as respiratory syncytial virus or influenza. Most program directors (98%) did not endorse that children hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 should be made do-not-resuscitate and had variable opinions on whether children should be given higher priority over adults when rationing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Over half of program directors (60%) did not support the use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for coronavirus disease 2019. CONCLUSIONS The majority of pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation centers have proactively established guidelines for the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for coronavirus disease 2019-related illnesses. Further work is needed to help guide the fair allocation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation resources and to determine the appropriateness of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation.",

        "doi": "10.4187\/respcare.07882",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND The overwhelming demand for mechanical ventilators due to COVID-19 has stimulated interest in using one ventilator for multiple patients (multiplex ventilation). Despite a plethora of information on the Internet, there is little supporting evidence and no human studies. The risk of multiplex ventilation is that ventilation and PEEP effects are largely uncontrollable and depend on the difference between patient resistance, (R) and compliance (C). It is not clear whether volume control or pressure control is safer or more effective. We designed a simulation-based study to allow complete control over the relevant variables to determine the effects of various degrees of RC imbalance on tidal volume (VT), end-expiratory lung volume (VEE), and imputed pH. METHODS Two separate breathing simulators were ventilated with a ventilator using pressure control (PC) and volume control (VC) breaths. Evidence-based lung models simulated a range of differences in R and C (six pairs of simulated patients). Differences in VT, VEE, and imputed pH were recorded. RESULTS Depending on differences in R and C, differences in VT ranged from 1% (equal R and C) to 79%. Differences in VEE ranged from 2% to 109%. Differences in pH ranged from 0% to 5%. Failure due to excessive tidal volume (> 8 mL\/kg) did not occur. Failure due to excessive VEE difference (> 10%) was evident in 50% of patient pairs. There was no difference in failure rate between VC and PC. CONCLUSIONS These experiments confirmed the potential for markedly different ventilation and oxygenation for patients with uneven respiratory system impedances during multiplex ventilation. Three critical problems must be solved to minimize risk: (1) partitioning of inspiratory flow from the ventilator individually between the two patients, (2) measurement of VT delivered to each patient, and (3) provision for individual PEEP. We provide suggestions for solving these problems.",

Despite a plethora of<br>information on the Internet, there is little supporting<br>evidence and no human studies. The risk of multiplex<br>ventilation is that ventilation and PEEP effects are<br>largely uncontrollable and depend on the difference<br>between patient resistance, (R) and compliance (C).

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE We sought to examine the diagnostic utility of existing predictors of any haemorrhagic transformation (HT) and compare them to novel perfusion imaging permeability measures in ischemic stroke patients receiving alteplase only. METHODS A pixel-based analysis of pre-treatment CT perfusion (CTP) was undertaken to define the optimum CTP permeability thresholds to predict the likelihood of HT. We then compared previously proposed predictors of HT using regression analyses and receiver operator characteristic curve analysis to produce an Area Under the Cure (AUC), and compared AUCs using Chi Square analysis. RESULTS From 5 centres, 1407 patients were included in this study, 282 had HT. The cohort was split into a derivation (1025, 70% patients) and validation cohort (382 patients or 30%). The E permeability map at a threshold of 30% relative to contralateral had the highest AUC at predicting any HT (derivation AUC 0.85, 95% CI, 0.79-0.91, validation AUC 0.84, 95% CI, 0.77-0.91). The AUC improved when permeability was assessed within the acute perfusion lesion for the E maps at a threshold of 30% (derivation AUC 0.91, 95% CI, 0.86-0.95, validation AUC 0.89, 95% CI, 0.86-0.95). Previously proposed associations with HT and PH showed lower AUC values than the permeability measure. INTERPRETATION In this large multi-centre study, we have validated a highly accurate measure of HT prediction. This measure may be useful in clinical practice to predict haemorrhagic transformation in ischemic stroke patients before receiving alteplase alone. This article is protected by copyright.

Clinical and socioeconomic markers have not proven to be adequately reliable. The limitation in prognostication includes those term and late-preterm infants born with neonatal encephalopathy. The General Movements Assessment tool by Prechtl has demonstrated reliability for identifying infants at risk for neuromotor impairment. This tool is non-invasive and cost-effective. The purpose of this study is to identify the published literature on how this tool applies to the prediction of cerebral palsy in term and late-preterm infants diagnosed with neonatal encephalopathy and so detect the research gaps. METHODS We will conduct a systematic scoping review for data on sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value and describe the strengths and limitations of the results. This review will consider studies that included infants more than or equal to 34 + 0 weeks gestational age, diagnosed with neonatal encephalopathy, with a General Movements Assessment done between birth to six months of life and an assessment for cerebral palsy by at least 2 years of age. Experimental and quasi-experimental study designs including randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, before and after studies, interrupted time-series studies and systematic reviews will be considered. Case reports, case series, case control, and cross-sectional studies will be included. Text, opinion papers, and animal studies will not be considered for inclusion in this scoping review as this is a highly specific and medical topic. Studies in the English language only will be considered. Studies published from at least 1970 will be included as this is around the time when the General Movements Assessment was first introduced in neonatology as a potential predictor of neuromotor outcomes. We will search five databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, Scopus, and CINAHL). Two reviewers will conduct all screening and data extraction independently. The articles will be categorized according to key findings and a critical appraisal performed. DISCUSSION The results of this review will guide future research to improve early identification and timely intervention in infants with neonatal encephalopathy at risk of neuromotor impairment.

        "doi": "10.1016\/j.jclinane.2020.109818",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) have revolutionized the field of anesthesiology as they facilitate airway management and ensure optimal surgical conditions. Despite their beneficial and ubiquitous use during surgery, delayed or partial recovery from NMBAs, referred to as residual neuromuscular block (rNMB), is a common clinical problem. While it is well accepted that the antagonist sugammadex, compared to neostigmine, can more rapidly reverse rocuronium-induced NMB regardless of depth of block, the occurrence of rNMB for routinely used combinations of NMBAs with sugammadex or neostigmine has not yet been quantified or evaluated systematically. REVIEW METHODS We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to quantify and compare the incidence of rNMB [defined as train-of-four ratio (TOFR) <0.9] in patients with moderate and deep neuromuscular block. Methods recommended by Cochrane Collaboration and PRISMA group were followed. RESULTS A total of 35 RCTs were identified, of which 20 contributed to the meta-analysis. For moderate block, rNMB incidence at 2 min after sugammadex administration was 19.2% (95% CI 0.0-57.8; 122 patients) and declined to 2.8% (95% CI 0.0-16.7; 93 patients) at 6 min post administration. For timepoints 10 to 60 min after administration, rNMB incidence ranged between 0.05% to 2.8%. In contrast, rNMB incidence at 2 min after neostigmine administration was 100% (95% CI 89.9-100; 182 patients) and was 82% (95% CI 71.4-91.2; 93 patients) at 6 min post administration. For timepoints 10 to 60 min after administration, rNMB incidence ranged between 14 and 32%. For deep block, rNMB incidence following sugammadex was essentially reduced to 1% at 15 min after administration. Residual NMB incidence following neostigmine remained at or above 95% for the first 60 min after administration. CONCLUSIONS Overall, based on evidence from 20 RCTs, our results suggest that the combination of rocuronium or vecuronium plus sugammadex is more effective and more rapid in reversing NMB compared with combinations of rocuronium, vecuronium, cisatracurium, or pancuronium plus neostigmine.",

We aimed to identify clinical and imaging determinants that are associated with collateral grade on baseline computed tomography angiography in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to an anterior circulation large vessel occlusion. Methods- Patients included in the MR CLEAN trial (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands; n=500) and MR CLEAN Registry (n=1488) were studied. Collateral status on baseline computed tomography angiography was scored from 0 (absent) to 3 (good). Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to test the association of selected determinants with collateral status. Results- In total, 1988 patients were analyzed. Distribution of the collateral status was as follows: absent (7%, n=123), poor (32%, n=596), moderate (39%, n=735), and good (23%, n=422). Associations for a poor collateral status in a multivariable model existed for age (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.92 per 10 years [95% CI, 0.886-0.98]), male (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.53-0.76]), blood glucose level (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.95-1.00]), and occlusion of the intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery with occlusion of the terminus (adjusted common odds ratio 0.50 [95% CI, 0.41-0.61]). In contrast to previous studies, we did not find an association between cardiovascular risk factors and collateral status.

Methods We retrospectively analyzed all primary spontaneous pneumothorax patients who underwent treatment at Gangnam Severance Hospital between August 2014 and May 2018. Results A total of 279 patients were divided into 2 groups: the conventional group (n=236) and the Thoracic Egg group (n=43). Of the 236 patients in the conventional group, 100 were excluded because they underwent surgery during the study period. The efficacy and cost were compared between the 2 groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups regarding recurrence (conventional group, 36 patients [26.5%]; Thoracic Egg group, 15 patients [29.4%]; p=0.287). However, the Egg group had statistically significantly lower mean medical expenses than the conventional group (433,413 Korean won and 522,146 Korean won, respectively; p<0.001).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND During the COVID-19 pandemic, ventilator sharing was suggested to increase availability of mechanical ventilation. The safety and feasibility of ventilator sharing is unknown. METHODS A single ventilator in pressure control mode was used with flow control valves to simultaneously ventilate two patients with different lung compliances. The system was first evaluated using high-fidelity human patient simulator mannequins and then tested for 1 h in two pairs of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure. Patients were matched on positive end-expiratory pressure, fractional inspired oxygen tension, and respiratory rate. Tidal volume and peak airway pressure (PMAX) were recorded from each patient using separate independent spirometers and arterial blood gas samples drawn at 0, 30, and 60 min. The authors assessed acid-base status, oxygenation, tidal volume, and PMAX for each patient. Stability was assessed by calculating the coefficient of variation. RESULTS The valves performed as expected in simulation, providing a stable tidal volume of 400 ml each to two mannequins with compliance ratios varying from 20:20 to 20:90 ml\/cm H2O. The system was then tested in two pairs of patients. Pair 1 was a 49-yr-old woman, ideal body weight 46 kg, and a 55-yr-old man, ideal body weight 64 kg, with lung compliance 27 ml\/cm H2O versus 35 ml\/cm H2O. The coefficient of variation for tidal volume was 0.2 to 0.6%, and for PMAX 0 to 1.1%. Pair 2 was a 32-yr-old man, ideal body weight 62 kg, and a 56-yr-old woman, ideal body weight 46 kg, with lung compliance 12 ml\/cm H2O versus 21 ml\/cm H2O. The coefficient of variation for tidal volume was 1.4 to 7.7%, and for PMAX 0 to 2.1%. CONCLUSIONS Differential ventilation using a single ventilator is feasible. Flow control valves enable delivery of stable tidal volume and PMAX similar to those provided by individual ventilators. : WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: In previous mass casualty situations where intensive care unit or emergency room surge conditions have resulted, the use of ventilator splitting to ventilate two or more patients has been proposed.The concept has received renewed attention with the global COVID-19 pandemic.The impaired respiratory mechanics similar to the acute respiratory distress syndrome seen in COVID-19 patients pose significant engineering challenges to optimally ventilate one patient while preventing damage to a paired patient. WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW Custom designed three-dimensional printed inspiratory flow control valves designed to allow individualized setting of tidal volume and airway pressure were evaluated using high-fidelity simulator mannequins with similar or different lung compliance and were found to perform as expected with stable tidal volumes delivered to each mannequin.Testing for 60 min in two pairs of volunteer COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure, matched on positive end-expiratory pressure level, fractional inspired oxygen tension level, and respiratory rate, demonstrated stable system performance. Continuous assessment of tidal volume and peak airway pressure in each patient during the study allowed for dynamic alteration of tidal volume in response to respiratory acidosis.This study suggests that custom designed flow control valves may facilitate the use of split ventilation techniques in a surge setting.",

However, severe cardiopulmonary disturbances during the surgery may affect cerebral perfusion and oxygenation. We therefore hypothesized that regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) would decrease significantly during the surgery. In addition, the influencing factors of rSO2 would be investigated. METHODS A total of 60 patients scheduled for selective totally thoracoscopic ablation for stand-alone atrial fibrillation were enrolled in this prospective observational study. The rSO2 was monitored at baseline (T0), 15 min after anesthesia induction (T1), 15 minute after 1-lung ventilation (T2), after right pulmonary vein ablation (T3), after left pulmonary vein ablation (T4) and 15 minute after 2-lung ventilation (T5) using a near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy -based cerebral oximeter. Arterial blood gas was analyzed using an ABL 825 hemoximeter. Associations between rSO2 and hemodynamic or blood gas parameters were determined with univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses. RESULTS The rSO2 decreased greatly from baseline 65.4% to 56.5% at T3 (P < .001). Univariate analyses showed that rSO2 correlated significantly with heart rate (r = -0.173, P = .186), mean arterial pressure (MAP, r = 0.306, P = .018), central venous pressure (r = 0.261, P = .044), arterial carbon dioxide tension (r = -0.336, P = .009), arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2, r = 0.522, P < .001), and base excess (BE, r = 0.316, P = .014). Multivariate linear regression analyses further showed that it correlated positively with PaO2 (\u03b2 = 0.456, P < .001), MAP (\u03b2 = 0.251, P = .020), and BE (\u03b2 = 0.332, P = .003). CONCLUSION Totally thoracoscopic ablation for atrial fibrillation caused a significant decrease in rSO2. There were positive correlations between rSO2 and PaO2, MAP, and BE.",

METHODS Mechanical thrombectomy was performed on five consecutive patients with COVID-19 with large vessel occlusions. A retrospective study of these patients was performed. Patient demographics, laboratory values, mechanical thrombectomy technique, and clinical and angiographic outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS Four patients with COVID-19 presented with anterior circulation occlusions and one patient with COVID-19 presented with both anterior and posterior circulation occlusions. All patients had coagulation abnormalities. Mean patient age was 52.8 years. Three patients presented with an intracranial internal carotid artery occlusion. Two patients presented with an intracranial occlusion and a tandem thrombus in the carotid bulb. One patient presented with an occlusion in both the internal carotid and basilar arteries. Clot fragmentation and distal emboli to a new vascular territory were seen in two of five (40%) patients, and downstream emboli were seen in all five (100%) patients. Patient clinical outcome was generally poor in this series of patients with COVID-19 large vessel occlusion. CONCLUSION Our series of patients with COVID-19 demonstrated coagulation abnormalities, and compared with our previous experience with mechanical thrombectomy in large vessel occlusion, this group of patients were younger, had tandem or multiple territory occlusions, a large clot burden, and a propensity for clot fragmentation.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify the ideal blood pressure (BP) target in neurologically deceased organ donors to optimize outcomes of recipient organ function and survival, and organs transplanted per donor. SOURCE We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to December 2018 for studies that evaluated BP targets in neurologically deceased organ donors. A two-step review process with three independent reviewers was employed. We assessed the risk of bias and applied Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology to evaluate the certainty of the evidence by outcome. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Twelve cohort studies were included in our final analysis. Seven studies showed that hypotension was associated with worse post-transplant graft function or survival, while three studies found no association between hypotension and post-transplant graft function or survival. Two other studies showed no association between hypotension and organs transplanted per donor. Overall, six of the identified studies had serious risk of bias. CONCLUSION A systolic BP less 90 mmHg may be associated with graft dysfunction in kidney recipients, but this is based on very low certainty in evidence. Although an ideal and universal BP target in neurologically deceased organ donors is not clearly identifiable in the literature, this could reflect the complexity of donor hemodynamics and the need for individualized targets for different organs.

However, it has gained widespread acceptance only in the last few years since studies have shown significant survival benefit. Many centers have established prone ventilation in their treatment algorithm for mechanically ventilated patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Physiologically, PP should also benefit awake, non-intubated patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. However, proning in non-intubated (PINI) patients did not gain any momentum until a few months ago when the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic surged. A large number of sick patients overwhelmed the health care system, and many centers faced a dearth of ventilators. In addition, outcomes of patients placed on mechanical ventilation because of COVID-19 infection have been highly variable and often dismal. Hence, increased focus has shifted to using various strategies to prevent intubation, such as PINI. There is accumulating evidence that PINI is a low-risk intervention that can be performed even outside intensive care unit with minimal assistance and may prevent intubation in certain patients with ARDS. It can also be performed safely at smaller centers and, therefore, may reduce the patient transfer to larger institutions that are overwhelmed in the current crisis. We present a case series of 2 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure who experienced significant improvements in oxygenation with PP.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES Lateral displacement and impaired cerebral autoregulation are associated with worse outcomes following acute brain injury, but their effect on long-term clinical outcomes remains unclear. We assessed the relationship between lateral displacement, disturbances to cerebral autoregulation, and clinical outcomes in acutely comatose patients. DESIGN Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. SETTING Neurocritical care unit of the Johns Hopkins Hospital. PATIENTS Acutely comatose patients (Glasgow Coma Score \u2264 8). INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Cerebral oximetry index, derived from near-infrared spectroscopy multimodal monitoring, was used to evaluate cerebral autoregulation. Associations between lateral brain displacement, global cerebral autoregulation, and interhemispheric cerebral autoregulation asymmetry were assessed using mixed random effects models with random intercept. Patients were grouped by functional outcome, determined by the modified Rankin Scale. Associations between outcome group, lateral displacement, and cerebral oximetry index were assessed using multivariate linear regression. Increasing lateral brain displacement was associated with worsening global cerebral autoregulation (p = 0.01 septum; p = 0.05 pineal) and cerebral autoregulation asymmetry (both p < 0.001). Maximum lateral displacement during the first 3 days of coma was significantly different between functional outcome groups at hospital discharge (p = 0.019 pineal; p = 0.008 septum), 3 months (p = 0.026; p = 0.007), 6 months (p = 0.018; p = 0.010), and 12 months (p = 0.022; p = 0.012). Global cerebral oximetry index was associated with functional outcomes at 3 months (p = 0.019) and 6 months (p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS During the first 3 days of acute coma, increasing lateral brain displacement is associated with worsening global cerebral autoregulation and cerebral autoregulation asymmetry, and poor long-term clinical outcomes in acutely comatose patients. The impact of acute interventions on outcome needs to be explored.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Sore throat is a remarkable complication after thyroid surgery with endotracheal tube (ETT). Many studies revealed that laryngeal mask airway (LMA) might reduce the incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat. However, little is known about the use of a flexible reinforced LMA (FLMA) in thyroid surgery. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential benefits of FLMA compared with ETT on postoperative sore throat. METHODS In this prospective, single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, ninety-six patients aged 20-80 years, scheduled for elective radical thyroidectomy under general anesthesia were enrolled. They were randomly divided into ETT group and FLMA group. All the included patients received total intravenous anesthesia (with propofol, fentanyl and rocuronium) and controlled mechanical ventilation during the surgery. Cuff pressure of ETT and FLMA were strictly controlled. Incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat, numbness and hoarseness at 1, 24, and 48 h after surgery was evaluated and compared between the two groups. Incidence and severity of buckling during extubation and the hemodynamic profile during intubation were also recorded and compared. RESULTS The incidence of sore throat and hoarseness was significantly lower in FLMA group than those in ETT group at 1 h, 24 h and 48 h postoperatively, as well as the severity of sore throat. Compared to ETT group, there was a significantly lower incidence of buckling during extubation and less fluctuation of HR and BP at 1 min and 3 min after intubation in FLMA group. CONCLUSIONS Patients undergoing thyroid surgery with FLMA had less postoperative laryngopharyngeal symptoms when compared with ETT. The use of FLMA also achieved less buckling during extubation and better hemodynamic profiles during intubation.

The time of nociception occurrence was defined as when the signs of inadequate anaesthesia occurred. The median values of NPI, SPI, and ANI for 1 minute from the time of the sign of inadequate anaesthesia were determined as the value of each analgesic index that represents inadequate anaesthesia. The time of no nociception was determined as 2 minutes before the onset of skin incision, and the median value for 1 minute from that time was defined as the baseline value. In total, 81 patients were included in the analysis. NPI showed good performance in distinguishing inadequate anaesthesia during propofol-remifentanil based general anaesthesia. NPI had the highest value in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, albeit without statistical significance (NPI: 0.733, SPI: 0.722, ANI: 0.668). The coefficient of variations of baseline values of NPI, SPI, and ANI were 27.5, 47.2, and 26.1, respectively.

Though various intubation devices have been demonstrated to perform well in oral endotracheal intubation, limited information is available concerning nasotracheal intubation (NTI) in patients with cervical spine immobilization. The present study compared the performance of the C-MAC D-Blade videolaryngoscope with the McCoy laryngoscope for NTI in patients with simulated cervical spine injuries. METHODS This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, study done in a tertiary hospital. Ninety-five patients requiring NTI were included in data analysis: McCoy group (group M, n = 47) or C-MAC D-Blade videolaryngoscope group (group C, n = 48). A Philadelphia neck collar was applied before anesthetic induction to immobilize the cervical spine. Single experienced anesthesiologist performed NTI. The primary outcome was duration of intubation divided by three steps: nose to oropharynx; oropharynx into glottic inlet; and glottic inlet to trachea. Secondary outcomes included glottic view as percentage of glottis opening (POGO) score and Cormack-Lehance (CL) grade, modified nasal intubation-difficulty scale (NIDS) rating, hemodynamic changes before and after intubation, and complications. RESULTS Total intubation duration was significantly shorter in group C (39.5 \u00b1 11.4 s) compared to group M (48.1 \u00b1 13.9 s). Group C required significantly less time for glottic visualization and endotracheal tube placement in the trachea. More patients in group C had CL grade I and higher POGO scores (P < 0.001, for both measures). No difficulty in NTI (modified NIDS = 0) was more in group C than group M. Hemodynamic changes and incidence of complications were comparable between groups. CONCLUSION The C-MAC D-Blade videolaryngoscope is an effective tool for NTI in a simulated difficult airway, which improves glottic visualization and shortens intubation time relative to those with McCoy laryngoscope.

The DISE procedure was performed on 48 obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or snoring patients. The parameters simultaneously recorded on a single monitor are (1) the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol (through the target controlled infusion (TCI) pump monitor), (2) the endoscopic upper airway view, (3) the polygraphic pattern, and (4) the level of sedation (through the bispectral index (BIS) value). In parallel to the BIS recording, the middle latency auditory evoked potential (MLAEP) was also recorded and provided. Recorded videos from the 5VsEs machine were re-evaluated six months later by the same clinician and a second clinician to evaluate the concordance of the therapeutic indications between the two. After the six-month period, the same operator confirmed all their clinical decisions for 45 out of 48 videos. Three videos were no longer evaluable for technical reasons, so were excluded from further analysis. The comparison between the two operators showed a complete adherence in 98% of cases.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Robotically assisted mitral valve repair was approved for use in Japan in April 2018. The study objective was to assess the safety and clinical outcomes of robotic mitral valve surgery in the first 100 cases performed in our center. METHODS We reviewed the first 100 patients who underwent robotic primary mitral valve repair, including concomitant procedures, from April 2018 to August 2019. The cause of mitral valve disease was degenerative (n = 94), endocarditis (n = 2), functional (n = 2), and other (n = 2). RESULTS There was no in-hospital or 30-day mortality. Mitral valve repair was completed in all patients. Only one patient required conversion to full sternotomy due to left ventricular apex bleeding. In echocardiography performed before hospital discharge, the mitral regurgitation was graded as none or trivial in 94 patients (94%) and mild in 4 (4%). Only two patients required surgical re-intervention due to postoperative hemolysis with moderate mitral regurgitation. For patients who underwent the mitral valve procedure alone, the median times of the total operation, cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic clamping, and console usage were 185, 112, 71, and 60 min, respectively. The learning curve showed that the operation time decreased slightly during the first ten cases and then plateaued at a mean of approximately 180 min. CONCLUSIONS Robotically assisted mitral valve repair was feasible, safe, and therapeutically effective in the first 100 cases, with a minimal learning curve. The robotically assisted approach provides a high-quality surgical view and tremorless suture\/cut handling, which will contribute to further development of minimally invasive mitral valve surgery.",

        "abstract": "Background: It has been projected that there will be too few ventilators to meet demand during the COVID-19 (SARS CoV-2) pandemic. Ventilator sharing has been suggested as a crisis standard of care strategy to increase availability of mechanical ventilation. The safety and practicality of shared ventilation in patients is unknown. We designed and evaluated a system whereby one mechanical ventilator can be used to simultaneously ventilate two patients who have different lung compliances using a custom manufactured flow control valve to allow for individual adjustment of tidal volume and airway pressure for each patient. Methods: The system was first evaluated in a simulation lab using two human patient simulators under expected clinical conditions. It was then tested in an observational study of four patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Two separately ventilated COVID-19 patients were connected to a single ventilator for one hour. This intervention was repeated in a second pair of patients. Ventilatory parameters (tidal volume, peak airway pressures, compliance) were recorded at five minute intervals during both studys. Arterial blood gases were taken at zero, thirty, and sixty minutes. The primary outcome was maintenance of stable acid-base status and oxygenation during shared ventilation. Results: Two male and two female patients, age range 32-56 yrs, participated. Ideal body weight and driving pressure were markedly different among patients. All patients demonstrated stable physiology and ventilation for the duration of shared ventilation. In one patient tidal volume was increased after 30 minutes to correct a respiratory acidosis. Conclusions: Differential ventilation using a single ventilator and a split breathing circuit with flow control valves is possible. A single ventilator could feasibly be used to safely ventilate two COVID-19 patients simultaneously as a bridge to full ventilatory support.",

Some clinicians have, of necessity, jerry-rigged ventilators to support multiple patients, but these devices lack protected air streams or individualized controls for each patient.

We have developed the Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE), a rapidly deployable platform to more safely use a single ventilator to simultaneously support multiple critically-ill patients.

Here we demonstrate through simulated and in vivo pig evaluation the capacity of the iSAVE to support a range of respiratory clinical states. By leveraging off-the-shelf components that are readily available to intensive care unit (ICU) caregivers, the iSAVE could potentially be translated for human application to expand the ventilation capacity of hospitals using existing ventilators, minimizing the need to procure additional ventilators.",

Evidence Acquisition: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed EMBASE and two major preprint servers (biorXiv and medRxiv) from inception to April 14, 2020, for studies on the use of respiratory support in AHRF and viral pneumonia. Evidence Synthesis: The search identified 4086 records and we found only one randomized controlled trial out of 58 studies included, with great variabilities in support utilization and failure rates. Fifteen studies explored the issue of aerosolization\/contamination showing a high risk of airborne transmission via droplets generation during the use of these modalities Conclusions: Use of NRS and treatment failure in the context of COVID-19 and viral infection associated-AHRF, varied widely.

In patients mechanically ventilated with advance airways cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) maneuver may be simplified by keeping the ventilator on. This work assessed the response of a intensive care mechanical ventilator to CPR using a patient manikin ventilated in three conventional modes. Methods: Volume controlled (VCV), pressure controlled (PCV) and pressure regulated volume controlled (PRVC) ventilation were applied in a thorax physical model with or without chest compressions. The mechanical ventilator was set with inspiratory time of 1.0 s, ventilation rate of 10 breaths\/minute, positive end-expiratory pressure of 0 cmH2O, FiO2 of 1.0, target tidal volume of 600 ml and trigger level of -20 cmH2O. Airway opening pressure and ventilatory flow signals were continuously recorded. . Results: Chest compression resulted in increased airway peak pressure in all ventilation modes (p<0.001), specially with VCV (137% in VCV, 83% in PCV, 80% in PRVC). However, these pressures were limited to levels similar to release valves in manual resuscitators (~60 cmH2O). In pressure controlled modes tidal\/minute volumes decreased (PRVC=11%, p=0.027 and PCV=12%, p<0.001), while still within the variability observed during bag-valve-mask ventilation. During VCV, variation in tidal\/minute volumes were not significant (p=0.140). Respiratory rates were constant with and without chest compression.

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is creating ventilator shortages in many countries that is sparking a conversation about placing multiple people on a single ventilator. However, on March 26th the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), along with other leading medical organizations, released a joint statement warning clinicians that attempting this technique could lead to poor outcomes and high mortality. Nevertheless, several hospitals around the United States and abroad are turning to this technique out of desperation (e.g. New York), but little data exists to guide their approach. The overall objective of this study is to utilize a computational model of mechanically ventilated lungs to assess how patient-specific lung mechanics and ventilator settings impact lung tidal volume (Vt). Methods: We developed a single compartment computational model of four patients connected to a shared ventilator and validated it against a similar experimental study. We used this model to evaluate how patient-specific lung compliance (C) and resistance (R) would impact Vt under 5 ventilator settings of pre-set PIP, PEEP, and I:E ratio (suggested by Farkas, J.D. MD as an approach by hospitals to manage multiple patients on a single ventilator). Results: Our computational model predicts Vt within 10% of experimental measurements. Using this model to perform a parametric study, we provide proof-of-concept for an algorithm to better match patients in different hypothetical scenarios of a single ventilator shared by more than one patient. Conclusions: Assigning patients to pre-set ventilators based on their lung mechanics could be used to overcome some of the legitimate concerns of placing multiple patients on a single ventilator. We emphasize that our results are currently based on a computational model that has not been validated against any pre-clinical\/clinical data. Therefore, clinicians considering this approach should not look to our study as an exact estimate of predicted patient tidal volumes.",

Methods A retrospective analysis of consecutive patients admitted to Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from March 10, 2020, to May 17, 2020 with moderate to severe respiratory failure treated with High Flow nasal therapy (HFNT). HFNT patients were divided into two groups: HFNT only and HFNT progressed to IMV. The primary outcome was the ability of the ROX index to predict the need of IMV. Results Of the 837 patients with COVID-19, 129 met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 60.8 ({+\/-}13.6) years, BMI 32.6 ({+\/-}8), 58 (45 %) were female, 72 (55.8%) were African American, 40 (31%) Hispanic. 48 (37.2%) were smokers. Mean time to intubation was 2.5 days ({+\/-} 3.3). ROX index of less than 5 at HFNT initiation was predictive of progression to IMV (OR = 2.137, p = 0,052). Any decrease in ROX index after HFNT initiation was predictive of intubation (OR= 14.67, p <0.0001). {Delta}ROX (<=0 versus >0), peak D-dimer >4000 and admission GFR < 60 ml\/min were very strongly predictive of need for IMV (ROC = 0.86, p=).

The reason for the high rate of PNI associated with PP in COVID-19 ARDS is likely multifactorial, but may include an underlying state of hyperinflammation and hypercoagulability already linked to other the neurological sequelae of COVID-19. Physicians must be aware of this elevated susceptibility to PNI in severe COVID-19 and refined standard PP protocols in order to reduce the risk.",

The possibility of needing to ventilate multiple patients with a single ventilator raises patient health and safety concerns. This simulation study explores patient compatibility and ventilator settings during multi-patient ventilation without the use of flow compensating resistances. Methods: A whole-body computational physiology model was used to simulate each patient on a ventilator. The primary model of a single patient with a dedicated ventilator was augmented to model two patients sharing a single ventilator. A range of ventilator settings and patient characteristics were simulated for paired patients. In addition to mechanical ventilation parameters, the full physiological simulation provides estimates of additional values for oxyhemoglobin saturation, arterial oxygen tension, and other patient parameters. Findings: These simulations show patient outcome during multi-patient ventilation is most closely correlated to lung compliance, oxygenation index, oxygen saturation index, and endtidal carbon dioxide of individual patients. The simulated patient outcome metrics were satisfactory when the lung compliance difference between two patients was less than 12 cmH2O\/mL, and the oxygen saturation index difference was less than 2 mmHg. Interpretation: In resource-limited regions of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic will result in equipment shortages.

Results: Fifteen observational studies were included that gave a study population of 4,081 patients. Mechanical ventilation is the main respiratory support treatment for critically ill patients, which should be administered as soon as normal oxygenation cannot be maintained, and despite the fact that there is no current consensus on the parameters of mechanical ventilation, the evidence collected suggests the use of Fio2 on average 50%, PEEP of 14 cmH2O, lung compliance of 29-37 ml per cm of water, driving pressure between 12-14 cm of water and a plateau pressure of 22-25 cm of water. Conclusions: IL-6 is shown as a possible marker of respiratory failure and a worse prognosis as well as obesity.

We implemented a \"care map\", as a standardized multidisciplinary approach to improve patients monitoring using: uniform patient selection for ICU admission, a low-PEEP strategy and a pharmacologic strategic thromboembolism management. Methods A standardized protocol for managing COVID-19 patients and ICU admissions was implemented through accurate Early Warning Score (EWS) monitoring and thromboembolism prophylaxis at hospital admission. Dyspnea, mental confusion or SpO2 less than 85% were criteria for ICU admission. Ventilation approach employed low PEEP values (about 10 cmH2O in presence of lung compliance > 40 mL\/cmH2O) and FiO2 as needed. In presence of lower lung compliance (< 40 mL\/cmH2O) PEEP value was increased to about 14 cmH2O. Results From March 16th to April 12nd 2020, 41 COVID-19 patients were admitted to our ICU from a total of 310 patients. 83% (34) of them needed mechanical ventilation. The ventilation approach chosen employed low PEEP value based on BMI (PEEP 11+\/- 3.8 (10-12) cmH2O if BMI < 30 Kg\/m2; PEEP 15+\/- 3.26 (12-18) cmH2O if BMI >30 Kg\/m2). To date, ten patients (24%) died, four (9.7%) received mechanical ventilation, two were transferred to another hospital and 25 (60.9%) were discharged from ICU after a median of nine days. Discussion A multimodal approach for COVID-19 patients is mandatory. The knowledge of this multi-organ disease is growing rapidly, requiring improvements in the standard of care. Our approach implements an accurate pre-ICU monitoring and strict selection for ICU admission, and allows to reduce mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and mortality.

Besides prone positioning, other non-ventilatory strategies may reduce the intrapulmonary shunt. This study has investigated almitrine, a pharmacological option to improve oxygenation. Patients and Method. A case control series of 17 confirmed COVID-19 mechanically ventilated patients in prone or supine positioning was collected: 10 patients received two doses of almitrine (4 and 12 mcg\/kg\/min) at 30-45 min interval each, and were compared to 7 control COVID-matched patients conventionally treated. The end-point was the reduction of intra-pulmonary shunt increasing the PaO2 and ScvO2. Results Patients were male (59%) with median (25th, 75th percentiles) age of 70 (54-78) years and a BMI of 29 (23-34). At stable mechanical ventilatory settings, PaO2 (mmHg) at FiO2 1 (135 (85, 195) to 214 (121, 275); p = 0.06) tended to increase with almitrine. This difference was significant when the best PaO2 between the 2 doses was used : 215 (123,294) vs baseline (p = 0.01). A concomitant increase in ScvO2 occurred ((73 (72, 76) to 82 (80, 87); p = 0.02). Eight over 10 almitrine-treated patients increased their PaO2, with no clear dose-effect. During the same time, the controls did not change PaO2. In conclusion, in early COVID-19 with severe hypoxemia, almitrine infusion is associated with improved oxygenation in prone or supine positioning. This pharmacological intervention may offer an alternative and\/or an additional effect to proning and might delay or avoid more demanding modalities such as ECMO.",

In this study, the hypothesis is that there is little information describing cardiorespiratory physiological data from sheep models of intensive care and the author aimed to analyse such data to provide biological information that is currently not available for sheep that received extracorporeal life support (ECLS) following acute smoke-induced lung injury. Methods Nineteen mechanically ventilated adult ewes undergoing intensive care during evaluation of a form of ECLS (treatment) for acute lung injury were used to collate clinical observations. Eight sheep were injured by acute smoke inhalation prior to treatment (injured\/treated), while another eight were not injured but treated (uninjured\/treated). Two sheep were injured but not treated (injured\/untreated), while one received room air instead of smoke as the injury and was not treated (placebo\/untreated). The data were then analysed for 11 physiological categories and compared between the two treated groups. Results Compared with the baseline, treatment contributed to and exacerbated the deterioration of pulmonary pathology by reducing lung compliance and the arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2\/FiO2) ratio. The oxygen extraction index changes mirrored those of the PaO2\/FiO2 ratio. Decreasing coronary perfusion pressure predicted the severity of cardiopulmonary injury. Conclusions These novel observations could help in understanding similar pathology such as that which occurs in animal victims of smoke inhalation from house or bush fires, aspiration pneumonia secondary to tick paralysis and in the management of the severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans.",

        "abstract": "Background: Since December 2019, a global outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is responsible for massive influx of patients with acute respiratory failure in hospitals. We describe the characteristics, clinical course, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in a large public hospital in France. Method: It is a single centre retrospective observational cohort. From 27th March to 23rd April, consecutive patients receiving 10 to 15 l\/min of oxygen with a non-rebreather mask, who had signs of respiratory failure or were unable to maintain an SpO2 > 90%, were treated by CPAP with a face-mask unless the ICU physician judged that immediate intubation was indicated. The main outcome under study was reasons for CPAP discontinuation. Results: A total of 585 patients were admitted in Delafontaine hospital for COVID-19. ICU was quickly overwhelmed. Fifty-nine out of 159 (37%) patients requiring ICU care had to be referred to other hospitals. CPAP therapy was initiated in 49 patients and performed out of ICU in 41 (84%). Reasons for discontinuation of CPAP were intubation for invasive ventilation in 25 (51%) patients, improvement in 16 (33%), poor tolerance in 6 (12%) and death in 2 (4%). A decision not to intubate had been taken for the 2 patients who died while on CPAP. Conclusions: Treatment with CPAP is feasible and safe in a non-ICU environment in the context of a massive influx of patients. One third of these patients with high oxygen requirements did not eventually need invasive ventilation.",

International and national guidance has favoured early intubation, with concerns persisting over the use of CPAP. However, considering available evidence and local circumstances, early ward based CPAP and self proning was adopted in our institution. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this approach. Methods In this retrospective observational study we included all patients admitted with a positive COVID-19 PCR. Negative patients were also included where clinical suspicion remained high. A large number of simple CPAP machines were used with entrained oxygen. Ward staff were supported in their use by physiotherapists and an intensive critical care outreach program. CPAP was initiated early via protocol, with the aim of preventing rather than responding to deterioration. Data was analysed descriptively. Results 559 patients admitted prior to 1\/May\/20 were included. 29.5% received CPAP, 7.2% were admitted to ICU and 4.8% were ventilated. Hospital mortality was 33.3%, ICU mortality 54.5%. Following CPAP, 64% of patients with moderate or severe ARDS at presentation, who were candidates for escalation, avoided intubation during their stay. Conclusion Figures for ICU admission, intubation and overall hospital mortality are significantly lower than those reported in a large and relevant comparator database, whilst ICU mortality is similar. This is despite our population having high levels of co-morbidity and ethnicities associated with poor outcomes. We advocate this approach as both effective and safe.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objective: In mass crisis setting such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of patients requiring invasive ventilation may exceed the number of available ventilators. This challenge led to the concept of splitting ventilator between several patients, which aroused interest as well as a strong opposition from multiple professional societies (The joint statement)1.Establishment of a safe ventilator splitting setup which enables monitoring and control of each ventilated patient would be a desirable ability. Achieving independency between the Co-vent patients would enable effective coping with different individual clinical scenarios and broaden the pairing possibilities of patients connected to a single ventilator. We conducted an experiment to determine if our designed setup achieves these goals. Methods: We utilized a double two limbed modified ventilator circuits which were connected to dual lung simulators. Adding readily available pressure sensors (transducers), PEEP valves, flow control valves, one-way (check) valves and HME filters made the circuit safe enough and suitable for our goals. We first examined a single lung simulator establishing the baseline set parameters, while monitoring ventilator measures as Tidal Volume. The initial ventilator setting we chose was a controlled mandatory ventilation mode with a PIP (peak inspiratory pressure) of 25cmH2O, PEEP (Positive End Expiratory Pressure) of 5 cmH2O. In pressure control set at 20 cmH2O, the recorded mean TV( tidal volume) was 1000 mL (approximately 500 mL\/lung simulator) with an average MV(minute ventilation) of 13 L\/min (or 6.5 L\/min\/lung simulator). After examining the system with the dual modified circuits attached, and obtaining all the ventilation parameters, we simulated several clinical scenarios. We simulated clinical events such as: partial or full obstruction, disconnection, air leak and compliance differentials, which occur frequently on a ventilation course. Thus, it is a paramount system demand to keep undisturbed ventilation to the Co-vent patient A, while being challenged by patient B. Results: The adaptive split ventilator setup yields increased safety, monitoring, and controls ventilation parameters successfully for each connected simulated patient (using lung simulators).It also enables coping with several common clinical scenarios on a ventilation course, by allowing the care provider to control PIP and PEEP of each Co-Vent patient. Conclusion: In a mass crisis setting, when there is a shortage of ventilators supply, and as a last resort, this setup can be a viable option to act upon. This experiment demonstrates the ability of the split ventilator to ventilate dual lung simulators with increased safety, monitoring and ventilation pressures control of each simulated patient. This split ventilator kept supporting a simulated patient with undisturbed parameters while the CO-vent patient was simulated to be disconnected, having an air leak, or exhibiting lung compliance deterioration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a split ventilator setup demonstrates these capabilities. Our pilot experiment suggests a significant potential of expanding the ventilator support resources, and is especially relevant during COVID-19 outbreak. Since this setup has not been used in a clinical setting yet, further research should be conducted to explore the safety limits and the capabilities of this model.",

        "abstract": "In the current COVID-19 crisis, the US and many countries in the world are suffering acute shortages of modern ventilators to care for desperately ill patients. Since modern ICU ventilators are powerful devices that can deliver very high gas flow rates and pressures, multiple physicians have attempted to ventilate more than one patient on a single ventilator -- so-called 'vent splitting'. Early applications of this approach have utilized simple concatenations of ventilator tubing and T-pieces, to provide flow to more than one patient. Additional approaches using custom flow splitters -- sometimes made using 3D printing technologies -- have also advanced into the clinic with FDA approval. However, heretofore there has been less progress made on controlling individual ventilatory pressures for patients with severe lung disease. Given the inherent variability and instability of lung compliance amongst patients with COVID-19, there remains an important need to provide a means of extending ventilator usefulness to more than one patient, but in a way that provides more tailored pressures that can be titrated over time. In this descriptive report, we provide the basis for a ventilator circuit that can support two patients with individualized peak inspiratory and end-expiratory pressures. The circuit is comprised of exclusively 'off the shelf' materials and is inexpensive to produce. The circuit can be used with typical ICU ventilators, and with anesthesia ventilators used in operating rooms. Inspiratory and end-expiratory pressures for each patient can be titrated over time, without changes for one patient affecting the ventilation parameters of the other patient. Using in-line spirometry, individual tidal volumes can be measured for each patient. This Pressure-Regulated Ventilator Splitting (PReVentS) Yale University protocol operates under a pressure-control ventilatory mode, and may function optimally when patients are not triggering breaths from the ventilator. This method has been tested thus far only in the laboratory with mock lungs, and has not yet been deployed in animals or in patients. However, given the novelty and potential utility of this approach, we deemed it appropriate to provide this information to the broader critical care community at the present time. In coming days and weeks, we will continue to characterize and refine this approach, using large animal models and proof-of-principle human studies.",

        "abstract": "A potential shortage of intensive care ventilators has led to the idea to ventilate more than one patient with a single ventilator. Besides other problems, this is associated with the lack of knowledge concerning distribution of tidal volume and the patients' individual respiratory system mechanics. In this study we used two simple hand-manufactured adaptors to connect physical models of two adult respiratory systems to one ventilator. The artificial lungs were ventilated in the pressure-controlled mode and we investigated if disconnecting one lung from the ventilation circuit for several breaths would allow to determine reliably the other lung's tidal volume and compliance. Compliances and volumes were measured both with the ventilator and external sensors corresponded well. However, tidal volumes measured via the ventilator were smaller compared to the tidal volumes measured via the external sensors with an absolute error of 5.3 +\/- 2.5%. The tidal volumes of the individual artificial lungs were distributed in proportion to the compliances and did not differ relevantly when both artificial lungs were connected to when one was disconnected. We conclude that in case of emergency, ventilation of two patients with one ventilator requires two simple hand-crafted tubes as adaptors and available standard breathing circuit components. In such a setting, respiratory system mechanics and tidal volume of each individual patient can be reliably measured during short term clamping of the tracheal tube of the respective other patient.",

        "abstract": "Helmet non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is a form of continuous positive applied pressure that has emerged as a useful therapy for COVID-19 patients who require respiratory support but may not require invasive ventilation. Helmet NIV has seen an increase in use during the COVID-19 pandemic because it is low-cost, readily available, and provides viral filters between the patient and clinician. Helmet NIV may also provide better patient outcomes by delaying or eliminating the need for invasive ventilation. Its widespread adoption has been limited, however, by the lack of a respiratory monitoring system that is needed to address known safety vulnerabilities and to provide clinicians with a respiratory profile of the patient. To address this safety need, we have developed an inexpensive respiratory monitoring system that is based on readily available commercial components and is suitable for rapid local manufacture. The system is designed for use in conjunction with the COVID-19 Helmet developed by Sea-Long Medical Systems, but is modular and can be used with other ventilation systems. The monitoring system comprises one or more flow and pressure sensors and a central remote station that can be used to remotely monitor up to 20 patients simultaneously. The system reports flow, pressure, and clinically relevant metrics including respiratory rate, tidal volume equivalent, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and the ratio of inspiratory time to expiratory time (I:E). The device will sound alarms based on clinician-set thresholds. In bench tests using a commercial ventilator and artificial lung system, our device performs comparably to a commercial single-patient respiratory monitor. Results are presented from human-subject tests on a healthy volunteer undergoing helmet non-invasive ventilation. Detailed design and manufacturing documents are provided.",

To overcome these limitations, we demonstrate a split-ventilator configuration that enables individualized patient management by incorporating a commonly available pressure regulator used for gas appliances.

Bottlenecks in availability of ventilators and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may contribute to mortality, implying ethically difficult rationing decisions. It is unclear if accelerated equipment production will meet demand, calling for fallback solutions for life support in worst-case scenarios. Methods: Veno-venous extracorporeal gas exchange (VV-ECMO) can provide vital support in bilateral lung failure. VV-ECMO essentially comprises large flow venous accesses, membrane gas exchange, and a blood pump. As thousands of FDA and CE certified Impella blood pumps and consoles are distributed globally for cardiac support, we explored ad-hoc assembly of lean ECMO systems by embedding Impella pumps coaxially in tubes in combination with standard gas exchangers. Results: Ad-hoc integration of Impella blood pumps with gas exchange modules, standard cannulas for large bore venous access, regular ECMO tubing, Y-pieces and connectors led to lean ECMO systems with stable performance over several days. Oxygenation of 2.5-5 L of blood\/minute is realistic. Benefit\/risk analysis appears favorable if a patient requires respiratory support but cannot be supported because of lack of ventilators or unavailability of a required ECMO system. Conclusion: Ad-hoc assembly of veno-venous ECMOs using Impella pumps is feasible and results in stable blood flow across gas exchange modules. However, such off-label use of the devices calls for specific ethical and regulatory considerations prior to their use as last resort in patients for whom no other treatment modalities are available.",

Decellularization with high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) is reported to highly preserve extracellular matrix (ECM) which would be feasible for recellularization and vascular remodeling after implantation. In the present study, we conducted xenogeneic implantation of HHP-decellularized bovine vascular grafts from dorsalis pedis arteries to porcine carotid arteries then evaluated graft patency, ECM preservation and recellularization. Surgical procedure not to damage luminal surface of the grafts from drying significantly increased the graft patency at 4 weeks after implantation (P = 0.0079). After the technical improvement, all grafts (N = 5) were patent with mild stenosis due to intimal hyperplasia at 4 weeks after implantation. Neither aneurysmal change nor massive thrombosis was observed even without administration of anticoagulants nor anti-platelet agents. Elastica van Gieson and Sirius-red stainings revealed fair preservation of ECM proteins including elastin and collagen after implantation. Luminal surface of grafts was thoroughly covered with von Willebrand factor-positive endothelium. Scanning electron microscopy on luminal surface of implanted grafts exhibited cobblestone-like endothelial cell layer which is similar to native vascular endothelium. Recellularization of tunica media with alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive smooth muscle cells was partly observed. Thus, we confirmed that HHP-decellularized grafts are feasible for xenogeneic implantation accompanied by recellularization by recipient cells.",

        "abstract": "The mass transfer characteristics for oxygen from the gas phase to blood in a hollow fiber renal dialysis unit was investigated in vitro with a view to using such devices to effect respiratory support in patients with viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In our in vitro experiments, which were severely curtailed by prevailing circumstances, we used water as a substitute on the blood side. The water was saturated rapidly indicating that the system was flow limited rather than diffusion limited for oxygen transfer. Using these findings, we estimated the expected performance with blood and the results suggest that two dialysis units operating in parallel with a pure oxygen gas supply running counter-current to the blood flow, could supply up to 40% of the total required oxygen demand rate in an adult patient. While not studied, carbon dioxide elimination is likely to be feasible as well. It is thus possible that hollow fiber dialysis units operating with suitable roller pumps in a veno-venous access configuration, could serve as a cost-effective and readily available alternative or adjunct for respiratory support in the face of severe resource constraints. Verification and extension of our study is needed by well resourced laboratories who are still able to function during this unprecedented period of restrictions. If, after further studies and clinical considerations, this approach appears feasible, then consideration may be given to clinical deployment of this tech- nique in desperate situations where no alternative exists to preserve life.",

        "abstract": "With large numbers of COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation and ventilators being in short supply, in extremis two patients are having to share one ventilator. This possibility has been discussed for at least two decades, and careful matching of patient ventilation requirements is advised. However, with a large range of lung compliance and other characteristics, which may also vary with time, good matching is difficult to achieve. Adjusting the impedance of the flow path between ventilator and patient gives the opportunity to control the airway pressure and hence flow and volume individually for each patient. Several groups are now investigating this, in particular the addition of a flow restrictor in the inspiration tube for the patient who is more compliant, or requires a lower tidal volume. In this paper, we show that a simple linear resistance-compliance model, termed the BathRC model, of the ventilator tubing system and lung allows direct calculation of the relationships between pressures, volumes, and required flow restriction. The BathRC model is experimentally validated using a GE Aisys CS2 ventilator connected to two test lungs. The pressure-flow relationships for two restrictors are experimentally determined, and despite the need to approximate them with a linear resistance characteristic, their effect in the breathing circuit is accurately predicted by the simple model. The BathRC model is freely available for download; we do not condone dual ventilation, but this tool is provided to demonstrate that flow restriction can be readily estimated. This research is part of a larger test, simulation and design investigation on dual ventilation being undertaken at the UoB and RUH.",

A subset of these patients develops refractory hypoxaemia despite maximal conventional mechanical ventilation and require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This review focuses on considerations for ventilatory strategies, infection control and patient selection related to ECMO for ARDS in a pandemic. We also summarize the experiences with ECMO in previous respiratory pandemics. METHODS A review of pertinent studies was conducted via a search using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar. References of articles were also examined to identify other relevant publications. RESULTS Since the H1N1 Influenza pandemic in 2009, the use of ECMO for ARDS continues to grow despite limitations in evidence for survival benefit. There is emerging evidence to suggest that lung protective ventilation for ARDS can be further optimized while receiving ECMO so as to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury and subsequent contributions to multi-organ failure. Efforts to improve outcomes should also encompass appropriate infection control measures to reduce co-infections and prevent nosocomial transmission of novel respiratory viruses. Patient selection for ECMO in a pandemic can be challenging. We discuss important ethical considerations and predictive scoring systems that may assist clinical decision-making to optimize resource allocation. CONCLUSION The role of ECMO in managing ARDS during respiratory pandemics continues to grow. This is supported by efforts to redefine optimal ventilatory strategies, reinforce infection control measures and enhance patient selection.",

We sought to determine the duration and effects of fasting at our centre. METHODS A single-centre prospective observational study in patients undergoing elective cardiac catheterisation over a six-month period between 7 August 2017 to 7 February 2018 at Auckland City Hospital, New Zealand. RESULTS One thousand and thirty patients with a mean age of 66\u00b112 years underwent catheterisation. Sixty-seven percent were male, 26% had diabetes, 72% had hypertension and 23% had stage 3 or worse chronic kidney disease. The mean duration of fasting was 11.6\u00b14.9 hours with 80% fasting longer than recommended. One hundred and eight (48%) patients with documented chronic kidney disease did not receive recommended pre-hydration. The most common symptoms related to fasting were hunger (47 %), nausea (3.9%) and vomiting (0.8%). Hypertension (4.1%) and hyperglycaemia (0.8%) occurred due to missed medication. There were no reports of aspiration. CONCLUSION Most patients were fasted for significantly longer than recommended and pre-hydration was underutilised in patients at high risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.

We also show that the algebraic delay equations are forward Euler discretizations of the delay differential equations, with timesteps equal to transit times through model compartments.

        "abstract": "Due to the recent coronavirus outbreak, many efforts and innovative solutions have surfaced to deal with the possible shortage of ventilators upon catastrophic surges of patients. One solution involves splitting one ventilator to treat multiple patients and is in principle easy to implement, but there are obvious risks, and little is known on how the technique would work on patients with ARDS from Covid-19. Previous studies have shown that multiple test lungs of equal characteristics can be successfully ventilated from one machine, but that large variations in tidal volume delivery occurs when lungs with different compliance are connected. In contribution to the discussion of the feasibility of the technique, a technical assessment was done including experiments expanding on the previous studies using two types of test lungs, different ventilator settings and test lung characteristics. Using two test lungs connected to a ventilator, the tidal volumes and pressures into both lungs were measured for different combinations of lung compliance, airway resistances, modes of ventilation, inspiratory and end-expiratory pressure levels. We found discrepancies in delivered tidal volumes for paired test lungs proportional with compliance differences, little influence from differences in airway resistances, and that changes in compliance of only one test lung would also change the tidal volume delivered to the other test lung when in volume controlled mode. For one of the test lung types, we also found that higher PEEP settings could strongly influence the tidal volume balance between the test lungs. From this study and from a technical point of view, we were not able to identify reliable settings, adjustments or any simple measures to overcome the hazards of this simple technique, and a more advanced solution is indicated for mitigating risks.",

        "abstract": "Background: Recent pandemic has brought a sudden surge in the requirement of mechanical ventilators all over the world. In this backdrop, there is wide interest in looking for ways to support multiple patients from a single ventilator. Various solutions, based upon simple mechanical division of the ventilator tubings are described. However, recently warnings have been issued by multiple international professional societies against these plumbing solutions as it can seriously harm the patients. Methods: We have bifurcated the inspiratory and expiratory conduits from a single ventilator with addition of one way valves, pressure and flow sensors along with volume and PEEP control. A purpose-built software and a low-cost microcontroller based control system integrates and displays the data in the familiar ventilatory graphic and numerical format onto a generic screen. The system is calibrated with simulated lungs with varying compliance. In addition to the standard microbial, heat and moisture exchanger filters we design to add UV-C lights at 254-260 nanometre wavelength in the expiratory channel for its virucidal effect. Results: The dynamic ventilatory divider system is capable of providing and controlling individual flow, tidal volume (TV) and Positive End-expiratory pressure (PEEP) for individual patients. Furthermore, it would also display the ventilatory parameters of both the patients, on a single split screen, in a familiar format. FiO2 and rate are still controlled by the mother ventilator. Conclusions: The prototype system has a potential to provide safe ventilation to at least two individuals from a single ventilator, while maintaining the unique requirements of each patient.",

        "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created an unprecedented need for breathing assistance devices. Since the demand for commercial, full-featured ventilators is far higher than the supply capacity, many rapid-response ventilators are being developed for invasive mechanical ventilation of patients. Most of these emergency ventilators utilize mechanical squeezing of bag-valve-masks or Ambu-bags. These\"bag squeezer\"designs are bulky and heavy, depends on many moving parts, and difficulty to assemble and use. Also, invasive ventilation requires intensive care unit support, which may be unavailable to a vast majority of patients, especially in developing countries. In this work, we present a low-cost ($<$\\$200), portable (fits in an 8\"x8\"x4\"box), non-invasive ventilator (NIV), designed to provide relief to early-stage COVID-19 patients in low-resource settings. We used a high-pressure blower fan for providing noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. Our design supports continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) modes. A common concern of using CPAP or BiPAP for treating COVID-19 patients is the aerosolization of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We used a helmet-based solution that contains the spread of the virus. Our end-to-end solution is compact, low-cost ($<$\\$400 including the helmet, viral filters, and a valve), and easy-to-use. Our NIV provides 0-20 cmH$_{2}$O pressure with flow rates of 60-180 Lmin$^{-1}$. We hope that our report will encourage implementations and further studies on helmet-based NIV for treating COVID-19 patients in low-resource settings.",

        "abstract": "The increasing number of studies demonstrates the high potency of the intrathecal (IT) route for the delivery of biopharmaceuticals to the central nervous system (CNS). Our earlier data exhibited that both the infused volume and the infusion rate can regulate the initial disposition of the administered solute within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). On the other hand, fast additions of large volumes of liquid to the CSF inevitably raise the intracranial pressure (ICP), which may in turn lead to adverse reactions if the physiologically delimited threshold is exceeded. While long-term biological effects of elevated ICP (hydrocephalus) are known, the safety thresholds pertaining to short-term ICP elevations caused by IT infusions have not yet been characterized. This study aimed to investigate the dynamics of ICP in rats and non-human primates (NHPs) with respect to IT infusion rates and volumes. The data revealed that the addition of a liquid to the CSF raised the ICP in a rate and volume-dependent manner. At low infusion rates (<0.12 ml\/min in rats and<2 ml\/min in NHPs), NHPs and rats displayed similar tolerance patterns for extended durations. Specifically, safe accommodations of such added volumes were mainly facilitated by the accelerated pressure-dependent CSF drainage into the blood, with ICPs stabilizing at different levels below the safety threshold of 28+\/-4 mm Hg in rats and 50+\/-5 mm Hg in NHPs. High infusion rates caused uncompensated ICP elevations rapidly exceeding the safety thresholds. Their tolerance was species-dependent and was facilitated by the compensatory role of the varied components of craniospinal compliance while not excluding the possibility of other contributing factors. In conclusion, large volumes of liquids can safely be delivered via IT routes provided that ICP is monitored as a safety factor and cross-species physiological differences are accounted for.",

COVID-19 is associated with higher incidence of cardiovascular complications compared to previous coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV). We found only one case report from China where COVID-19-associated fulminant myocarditis and cardiogenic shock (CS) was successfully rescued using VA-ECMO as a bridge to recovery (BTR). We identified potential clinical scenarios (cardiac injury, myocardial infarction with and without obstructive coronary artery disease, viral myocarditis, and decompensated heart failure) leading to CS and risk factors for poor\/uncertain benefit (age, sepsis, mixed\/predominantly vasodilatory shock, prothrombotic state and\/or coagulopathy, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure or high-risk prognostic scores) specific to using VA-ECMO as BTR in COVID-19 infection. Additional considerations and proposed recommendations specific to the COVID-19 pandemic were formulated with guidance from published data and expert consensus. A small subset of patients with cardiovascular complications from COVID-19 infection may progress to refractory CS. Accepting that resource scarcity may be the overwhelming concern for healthcare systems during this pandemic, VA-ECMO can be considered in highly selected cases of refractory CS and echocardiographic evidence of biventricular failure. The decision to initiate this therapy should take into consideration availability of resources, perceived benefit as well as risks of transmitting disease.",

All patients underwent lung ultrasound imaging to verify the entity of lung recruitment after NI-CPAP initiation. RESULTS: After one hour of treatment we observed a significant improvement in PaO2\/FiO2 ratio in 10 patients. Notably, only 50% of them reached an effective improvement in lung aeration detectable with lung ultrasound. In the other 50% or patients the improvement in PaO2\/FiO2 might be related to blood redistribution and reverse of hypoxic vasoconstriction.

Despite progress and best efforts, the mortality rates projected remain high. Historical data outlook points towards 80% expected fatality for patients progressing to advanced pulmonary disease, even when hospitalized in the intensive care unit. This is particularly true among the patient population over 65. Novel life-saving strategies are desperately needed to mitigate the high mortality that will be associated with the late stage SARS-CoV-2 viral infection associated with the fatal respiratory distress. We hypothesize that the morbidity, severity of the disease, and underlying physiological events leading to mortality are closely linked to the TRPV1 expressing neuronal system (afferent\/efferent neurons) in the lungs. TRPV1 expressing cells are responsible for pain transmission, inflammation and immunomodulation throughout the entire pulmonary system and are modulating the processes associated with localized cytokine release (storm) and overall rapid disease progression. We suggest that therapeutic approaches targeting TRPV1 containing nerve fibers in the lungs will modulate the inflammatory and immune signal activity, leading to reduced mortality and better overall outcomes. We also propose to further explore the use of resiniferatoxin (RTX), an ultra-potent TRPV1 agonist currently in clinical trials for cancer and osteoarthritis pain, as a possible ablating agent of TRPV1 positive pulmonary pathways in patients with advanced COVID-19 disease.",

Typical treatments include hemi or full laminectomy with durotomy and microsurgical resection which can result in secondary scarring, and recurrent blockage of cerebrospinal fluid flow perpetuating the cycle. Case Description A 66-year-old woman presented with progressively worsening gait and memory. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an arachnoid web in the high thoracic region, causing cerebrospinal fluid flow obstruction and hydrocephalus. A standard lumbar drainage catheter was introduced percutaneously into the lumbar thecal sac, and advanced in a cephalad direction, across the arachnoid web, to the high thoracic region. The patient underwent continuous cerebrospinal fluid drainage through this catheter for a total of three days, displaying measurable clinical improvement that persisted at the three months follow up visit. Phase-contrast MRI demonstrated interval reconstitution of dorsal synchronous cerebrospinal fluid flow at the 2nd thoracic vertebral level, both on day three, as well as at the three months control imaging study. Conclusion This minimally invasive approach seems useful in achieving restoration of spinal fluid flow at the thoracic region when the underlying blockage results from an arachnoid web and leads to quantifiable clinical improvement.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) represents a life-saving therapy in cases of refractory hypoxia and has been utilized in patients suffering from the most severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A strikingly high mortality rate of 94% was described in early reports of patients with COVID-19 transitioned to ECMO. Later case reports and series demonstrating successful recovery from COVID-19 after ECMO have revived interest in this therapeutic modality, including the recent approval of ECMO for COVID-19 patients by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Here, we present the first reports of devastating intracranial hemorrhage as a complication of veno-venous (VV) ECMO in two COVID-19 patients. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We performed a retrospective analysis of 2 cases of devastating intracranial hemorrhage in patients on VV-ECMO for the treatment of COVID-19. Collected data included clinical history, laboratory results, treatment, and review of all available imaging. Both patients demonstrated activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTT) within an appropriate therapeutic range. No risk factors that clearly predicted likelihood of this complication were identified. CONCLUSION: Understanding the complications of ECMO in this cohort and developing therapeutic algorithms to aid in optimal patient selection will be critical in the limited resource setting experienced as a result of global pandemic. We propose the use of head computed tomography (CT) to identify devastating neurological complications as early as possible, aiding in the resource allocation of ECMO machines to the most appropriately selected patients.",

The aim of the present study was to determine whether an individualized titration of mechanical ventilation according to cardiopulmonary physiology reduces the mortality in patients with class III obesity and ARDS. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we enrolled adults admitted to the ICU from 2012 to 2017 who had class III obesity and ARDS and received mechanical ventilation for > 48 h. Enrolled patients were divided in two cohorts: one cohort (2012\u20132014) had ventilator settings determined by the ARDSnet table for lower positive end-expiratory pressure\/higher inspiratory fraction of oxygen (standard protocol-based cohort); the other cohort (2015\u20132017) had ventilator settings determined by an individualized protocol established by a lung rescue team (lung rescue team cohort). The lung rescue team used lung recruitment maneuvers, esophageal manometry, and hemodynamic monitoring. RESULTS: The standard protocol-based cohort included 70 patients (BMI = 49 \u00b1 9 kg\/m(2)), and the lung rescue team cohort included 50 patients (BMI = 54 \u00b1 13 kg\/m(2)). Patients in the standard protocol-based cohort compared to lung rescue team cohort had almost double the risk of dying at 28 days [31% versus 16%, P = 0.012; hazard ratio (HR) 0.32; 95% confidence interval (CI95%) 0.13\u20130.78] and 3 months (41% versus 22%, P = 0.006; HR 0.35; CI95% 0.16\u20130.74), and this effect persisted at 6 months and 1 year (incidence of death unchanged 41% versus 22%, P = 0.006; HR 0.35; CI95% 0.16\u20130.74). CONCLUSION: Individualized titration of mechanical ventilation by a lung rescue team was associated with decreased mortality compared to use of an ARDSnet table.

        "abstract": "During a severe pandemic, especially one causing respiratory illness, many people may require mechanical ventilation. Depending on the extent of the outbreak, there may be insufficient capacity to provide ventilator support to all of those in need. As part of a larger conceptual framework for determining need for and allocation of ventilators during a public health emergency, this article focuses on the strategies to assist state and local planners to allocate stockpiled ventilators to healthcare facilities during a pandemic, accounting for critical factors in facilities' ability to make use of additional ventilators. These strategies include actions both in the pre-pandemic and intra-pandemic stages. As a part of pandemic preparedness, public health officials should identify and query healthcare facilities in their jurisdiction that currently care for critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation to determine existing inventory of these devices and facilities' ability to absorb additional ventilators. Facilities must have sufficient staff, space, equipment, and supplies to utilize allocated ventilators adequately. At the time of an event, jurisdictions will need to verify and update information on facilities' capacity prior to making allocation decisions. Allocation of scarce life-saving resources during a pandemic should consider ethical principles to inform state and local plans for allocation of ventilators. In addition to ethical principles, decisions should be informed by assessment of need, determination of facilities' ability to use additional ventilators, and facilities' capacity to ensure access to ventilators for vulnerable populations (eg, rural, inner city, and uninsured and underinsured individuals) or high-risk populations that may be more susceptible to illness.",

        "abstract": "The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting disease COVID-19 causes pulmonary failure including severe courses requiring venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO). Coagulopathy is a known complication of COVID-19 leading to thrombotic events including pulmonary embolism. It is unclear if the coagulopathy also increases thrombotic circuit complications of the ECMO. Aim of the present study therefor was to investigate the rate of V-V ECMO complications in COVID-19. We conducted a retrospective registry study including all patients on V-V ECMO treated at our centre between 01\/2018 and 04\/2020. COVID-19 cases were compared non- COVID-19 cases. All circuit related complications resulting in partial or complete exchange of the extracorporeal system were registered. In total, 66 patients were analysed of which 11 (16.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The two groups did not differ in clinical parameters including age (COVID-19 59.4 vs. non-COVID-19 58.1 years), gender (36.4% vs. 40%), BMI (27.8 vs. 24.2) and severity of illness as quantified by the RESP Score (1pt. vs 1pt.). 28 days survival was similar in both groups (72.7% vs. 58.2%). While anticoagulation was similar in both groups (p = 0.09), centrifugal pump head thrombosis was more frequent in COVID-19 (9\/11 versus 16\/55 p < 0.01). Neither the time to first exchange (p = 0.61) nor blood flow at exchange (p = 0.68) did differ in both groups. D-dimer levels prior to the thrombotic events were significantly higher in COVID-19 (mean 15.48 vs 26.59, p = 0.01). The SARS-CoV-2 induced infection is associated with higher rates of thrombotic events of the extracorporeal system during V-V ECMO therapy.",

We hypothesized that patient outcomes would be improved at our tertiary cardiothoracic surgery referral center with a protocolized team-approach for ECMO treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 disease. CASE PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old healthy female developed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) bilateral pneumonia while vacationing in Colorado with her family. She was transferred to our facility for a higher level of care. Her respiratory status continued to deteriorate despite maximized critical care, including prone positioning ventilation and nitric oxide inhalation therapy. Veno-venous ECMO was initiated on hospital day 7 in conjunction with a 10-day course of compassionate use antiviral treatment with remdesivir. The patient\u2019s condition improved significantly and she was decannulated from ECMO on hospital day 17 (ECMO day 11). She was successfully extubated and eventually discharged to rehabilitation on hospital day 28.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To describe the technique and outcomes of percutaneous tracheostomy under laryngosuspension. METHODS: A consecutive series of patients who underwent percutaneous tracheostomy under laryngosuspension were reviewed for outcomes. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia and laryngosuspension. An 8.5 oral endotracheal tube is inserted and the cuff is inflated in the supraglottis, allowing access to the whole trachea and subglottis. The tube is taped to the laryngoscope. A rigid endoscope is inserted in the endotracheal tube through a swivel connector connected to the tube and the ventilation circuit. Percutaneous tracheostomy kit is used to perform dilatational tracheostomy at the desired level of the trachea under direct visual endoscopic control. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients underwent percutaneous tracheostomy under laryngosuspension. Thirty-two cases were performed in an emergency after securing the airway with endotracheal intubation. In all other cases, tracheostomy was performed as a part of an elective procedure affecting the airway or in patients requiring prolonged ventilation. More than half of patients were considered high risk by virtue of one or more of the following: morbid obesity, prior neck surgery, prior neck radiotherapy, progressive head and neck cancer, or laryngotracheal stenosis. Complications occurred in seven cases. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous tracheostomy under laryngosuspension has the advantage of optimal control of patient ventilation and hemostasis throughout the procedure. High-quality endoscopic vision and easy access to the airway under laryngosuspension allow tracheostomy to be performed with maximum safety.",

Initiating appropriate infection control measures may not always be achievable in primary care or in acute-care settings. Case A 45-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit due to severe pneumonia, later confirmed as COVID-19.

He was successfully treated in the intensive care unit with mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for respiratory support; and antiretroviral treatment with lopinavir\/ritonavir. His total intensive care unit stay was 15 days and was discharged on hospital day 24. Conclusions Strict infection control precautions are not always an easy task, especially under urgent care in an intensive care unit. However, severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia, or another novel infectious disease, could present at any moment and would be a continuing challenge to pursue appropriate measures.

Proning has become a standard treatment in the management of patients with ARDS who have difficulty achieving adequate oxygen saturation. The purpose of this study was to describe the use of early proning of awake, non\u2010intubated patients in the emergency department (ED) during the COVID\u201019 pandemic. METHODS: This pilot study was carried out in a single urban ED in New York City. We included patients suspected of having COVID\u201019 with hypoxia on arrival. A standard pulse oximeter was used to measure SpO(2). SpO(2) measurements were recorded at triage and after 5 minutes of proning. Supplemental oxygenation methods included non\u2010rebreather mask (NRB) and nasal cannula. We also characterized post\u2010proning failure rates of intubation within the first 24 hours of arrival to the ED. RESULTS: Fifty patients were included. Overall, the median SpO(2) at triage was 80% (IQR 69 to 85). After application of supplemental oxygen was given to patients on room air it was 84% (IQR 75 to 90). After 5 minutes of proning was added SpO(2) improved to 94% (IQR 90 to 95). Comparison of the pre\u2010 to post\u2010median by the Wilcoxon Rank\u2010sum test yielded P = 0.001. Thirteen patients (24%) failed to improve or maintain their oxygen saturations and required endotracheal intubation within 24 hours of arrival to the ED. CONCLUSION: Awake early self\u2010proning in the emergency department demonstrated improved oxygen saturation in our COVID\u201019 positive patients. Further studies are needed to support causality and determine the effect of proning on disease severity and mortality.",

Our aim was to design and test an affordable and easy-to-build non-invasive bilevel pressure ventilator to allow reducing the serious shortage of ventilators in LMICs. METHODS: The ventilator was built using off-the-shelf materials available via e-commerce and was based on a high-pressure blower, two pressure transducers and an Arduino Nano controller with a digital display (total retail cost <75 US$), with construction details open source provided for free replication. The ventilator was evaluated (and compared with a commercially available device (Lumis-150, Resmed): a) in the bench using an actively breathing patient simulator mimicking a range of obstructive\/restrictive disease and b) in 12 healthy volunteers wearing a high airway resistance and thoracic\/abdominal bands to mimic obstructive\/restrictive patients. RESULTS: The designed ventilator provided inspiratory\/expiratory pressures up to 20\/10 cmH(2)O, respectively, with no faulty triggering or cycling both in the bench test and in volunteers. Breathing difficulty score rated (1\u201310 scale) by the loaded breathing subjects was significantly (p<0.005) decreased from 5.45\u00b11.68 without support to 2.83\u00b11.66 when using the prototype ventilator, which showed no difference with the commercial device (2.80\u00b11.48; p=1.000).

Case Description A 75-year-old Japanese man was brought into our emergency department after receiving a left retroauricular stab wound by broken glass fragments. After spinal immobilization, a computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed glass fragments penetrating at the right craniocervical junction to the inter-atlanto-occipital subarachnoid space. CT angiography showed that both vertebral arteries (VAs) were not injured. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the glass fragments did not penetrate the cervical cord or medulla oblongata (MO). These glass fragments were removed via a midline incision from the external occipital protuberance to the C7 and with laminectomy without suboccipital craniectomy. Five of the glass fragments were found and removed in total. The dural defect was patched with a free fascia autograft. His postoperative course was uneventful. Postoperative CT angiography showed that both the vertebral arteries were intact as well as the complete removal of the glass fragments. Conclusions CT graphical diagnosis is useful for the management of penetrating craniocervical junction trauma, and it should be considered in the evaluation of patients who have suffered craniocervical penetrating injury even in the absence of major wounds or bleeding. Spinal immobilization of patients with craniocervical penetrating injuries is crucial to avoid not only secondary neurological damage but also secondary critical vascular damage.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an increasingly common intervention in the treatment of pancreaticobiliary disorders. Patients are often elderly with complex co-morbidities. While monitored anaesthesia care with sedation is commonly used for most cases, few would require general anaesthesia with an endotracheal tube. Both low-flow and high-flow nasal cannulas (HFNC) are established ways of delivering supplemental oxygen, but it is unclear whether one technique is better than the other. HFNC seems a promising tool for advanced procedures but evidence to support its application in high-risk ERCP cases is limited. The rate of oxygen desaturation during endoscopy has been reported to be as high as 11%\u201350% and the method of oxygen delivery for ERCP merits further study. METHODS\/DESIGN: This is a prospective, randomised, multicentre trial comparing the efficacy of oxygen supplementation through HFNC versus low-flow nasal cannula during ERCP, in a cohort of patients at risk of adverse respiratory events. A total of 132 patients will be recruited across three sites and randomly assigned to either the low-flow or the HFNC group. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients experiencing hypoxia, defined by any event of SpO2 < 90%. The secondary outcomes include parameters centred on oxygenation, requirement of airway manoeuvres, successful completion of procedure, perioperative complications, patient satisfaction and cost analysis of the consumables. An intention-to-treat principle will be applied while analysing. DISCUSSION: The demand for ERCPs is likely to increase in the future with the aging population. Our study results may lead to improved outcomes and reduce airway-related complications in patients undergoing ERCPs. The results will be presented at national and international meetings and published in peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.ANZCTR.org.au, CTRN12619000397112. Registered on 12 March 2019.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Purpose This study investigated the feasibility and efficacy of continuous noninvasive ventilation (NIV) support with 100% oxygen using a specially designed face mask, for reducing desaturation during fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB)-guided intubation in critically ill patients with respiratory failure. Materials and methods This was a single-center prospective randomized study. All patients undergoing FOB-guided nasal tracheal intubation were randomized to bag-valve-mask ventilation or NIV for preoxygenation followed by intubation. The NIV group were intubated through a sealed hole in a specially designed face mask during continuous NIV support with 100% oxygen. Control patients were intubated with removal of the mask and no ventilatory support. Results We enrolled 106 patients, including 53 in each group. Pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) after preoxygenation (99% (96%\u2013100%) vs. 96% (90%\u201399%), p = .001) and minimum SpO2 during intubation (95% (87%\u2013100%) vs. 83% (74%\u201391%), p < .01) were both significantly higher in the NIV compared with the control group. Severe hypoxemic events (SpO2 < 80%) occurred less frequently in the NIV group than in controls (7.4% vs. 37.7%, respectively; p < .01). Conclusions Continuous NIV support during FOB-guided nasal intubation can prevent severe desaturation during intubation in critically ill patients with respiratory failure.

The present article addresses the design and development of a human breathing assist machine (ventilator) prototype for use by qualified medical professionals in the emergency room, as well as in other locations, where a regular ventilator machine cannot be made available. The ventilator has been designed using readily available locally sourced materials, which can be assembled in a short time. This ensures the minimum required features to ventilate a patient in emergency conditions. The popular crank-rocker mechanism has been used to meet some of the vital design requirements of the emergency ventilator. The size of the links has been chosen to maintain a fixed inspiratory-to-expiratory (I:E) time ratio of 1:2. The kinematic linkage design has been kept modular by introducing a feature to adjust the location of the rocker tip to control the tidal volume from 100 ml to 600 ml of oxygenated air per breath. A virtual CAD model, based on the above-mentioned linkage design, has been designed to assess the variation of the position and velocity with time. Finally, a working prototype has been made, and it was observed that the I:E time ratio of 1:2 was achieved satisfactorily.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in infancy may have a long-term impact on the developing respiratory system. We planned a prospective cohort study to determine the impact of ARI during infancy on the pulmonary function test indices at 3 years of age. METHODS: A cohort of normal, full-term newborns were followed up 6 monthly and during ARI episodes. Infant pulmonary function tests (IPFTs) were performed at baseline and each follow-up visit using tidal breathing flow-volume loop, rapid thoracoabdominal compression (RTC) and raised volume RTC manoeuvres. During each ARI episode, nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for respiratory pathogens by real-time PCR. RESULTS: We screened 3421 neonates; 310 were enrolled; IPFT was performed in 225 (boys: 125 (55.6%)) at 3 years. During infancy, 470 ARI episodes were documented in 173 infants. At 3 years, children with history of any ARI episode during infancy had lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1.0)), forced expiratory volume in 0.75 s (FEV(0.75)), forced expiratory volume in 0.5 s (FEV(0.5)), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF(25\u201375)), and maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC (MEF(25)) as compared with those without any ARI episode during infancy. The ratio of tidal expiratory flow (TEF) at 25% or 50% of tidal expiratory volume to peak TEF (TEF(50) or TEF(25)\/peak TEF) at 3 years was significantly increased in children who had ARI in infancy. CONCLUSIONS: ARI during infancy is associated with impaired pulmonary function indices such as increased resistance and decreased forced expiratory flow and volume at 3 years of age.",

We developed a new experimental system in pigs to closely evaluate the process by which H(2) is absorbed in the lungs, enters the bloodstream, and is distributed, metabolized, and excreted. We inserted and secured catheters into the carotid artery (CA), portal vein (PV), and supra-hepatic inferior vena cava (IVC) to allow repeated blood sampling and performed bilateral thoracotomy to collapse the lungs. Then, using a hydrogen-absorbing alloy canister, we filled the lungs to the maximum inspiratory level with 100% H(2). The pig was maintained for 30 seconds without resuming breathing, as if they were holding their breath. We collected blood from the three intravascular catheters after 0, 3, 10, 30, and 60 minutes and measured H(2) concentration by gas chromatography. H(2) concentration in the CA peaked immediately after breath holding; 3 min later, it dropped to 1\/40 of the peak value. Peak H(2) concentrations in the PV and IVC were 40% and 14% of that in the CA, respectively. However, H(2) concentration decay in the PV and IVC (half-life: 310 s and 350 s, respectively) was slower than in the CA (half-life: 92 s). At 10 min, H(2) concentration was significantly higher in venous blood than in arterial blood. At 60 min, H(2) was detected in the portal blood at a concentration of 6.9\u201353 nL\/mL higher than at steady state, and in the SVC 14\u201329 nL\/mL higher than at steady state. In contrast, H(2) concentration in the CA decreased to steady state levels. This is the first report showing that inhaled H(2) is transported to the whole body by advection diffusion and metabolized dynamically.",

We do not provide technical details of such a \u20183rd generation\u2019 device, but rather present a theoretical analysis of its desirable properties, which are essential to overcome the remaining limitations of current 1st and 2nd generation devices. We also recommend that this further milestone improvement, i.e. ability to place the SAD accurately under direct vision, be eligible for the moniker \u20183rd generation\u2019.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates aerosol production with high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) compared to six liters per minute by low\u2010flow nasal cannula. METHODS: Two healthy volunteers were randomized to control (six liters per minute by low\u2010flow nasal cannula), NIPPV, or HFNC using block randomization. NIPPV conditions were studied using continuous positive airway pressures of 5, 10, and 15 cm H(2)O with an FiO(2) of 1.0 delivered via full\u2010face mask. HFNC conditions included flow rates of 30 and 40 liters per minute with an FiO(2) of 1.0 with and without coughing. HFNC and low\u2010flow nasal cannula conditions were repeated with and without participants wearing a surgical mask. Six aerosol sizes (0.3, 1.0, 2.5, 5, and 10 \u03bcm) and total aerosol mass were measured at two feet and six feet from the participant's nasopharynx. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in aerosol production between either HFNC or NIPPV and control. There was also no significant difference with the use of procedural mask over the HFNC. There was significant variation between the two participants, but in neither case was there a difference compared to control. There was an aerosol\u2010time trend, but there does not appear to be a difference between either flow rate, pressure, or control. Furthermore, there was no accumulation of total aerosol particles over the total duration of the experiment in both HFNC and NIPPV conditions.

        "abstract": "Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) is used as rescue therapy for severe cardiopulmonary failure. We tested whether the ratio of CO(2) elimination at the lung and the V-A ECMO (V\u0307co(2ECMO)\/V\u0307co(2Lung)) would reflect the ratio of respective blood flows and could be used to estimate changes in pulmonary blood flow (Q\u0307(Lung)), i.e., native cardiac output. Four healthy pigs were centrally cannulated for V-A ECMO. We measured blood flows with an ultrasonic flow probe. V\u0307co(2ECMO) and V\u0307co(2Lung) were calculated from sidestream capnographs under constant pulmonary ventilation during V-A ECMO weaning with changing sweep gas and\/or V-A ECMO blood flow. If ventilation-to-perfusion ratio (V\u0307\/Q\u0307) of V-A ECMO was not 1, the V\u0307co(2ECMO) was normalized to V\u0307\/Q\u0307 = 1 (V\u0307co(2ECMONorm)). Changes in pulmonary blood flow were calculated using the relationship between changes in CO(2) elimination and V-A ECMO blood flow (Q\u0307(ECMO)). Q\u0307(ECMO) correlated strongly with V\u0307co(2ECMONorm) (r(2) 0.95\u20130.99). Q\u0307(Lung) correlated well with V\u0307co(2Lung) (r(2) 0.65\u20130.89, P < = 0.002). Absolute Q\u0307(Lung) could not be calculated in a nonsteady state. Calculated pulmonary blood flow changes had a bias of 76 (\u2212266 to 418) mL\/min and correlated with measured Q\u0307(Lung) (r(2) 0.974\u20131.000, P = 0.1 to 0.006) for cumulative ECMO flow reductions. In conclusion, V\u0307co(2) of the lung correlated strongly with pulmonary blood flow. Our model could predict pulmonary blood flow changes within clinically acceptable margins of error.

A collar was designed and printed that covers the exhaust ports of the valve and returns exhaled gases to the ventilator. RESULTS: The collar piece was simple to print and easily assembled with the standard PEEP valve. In bench testing it successfully created differential pressures in 2 simulated expiratory limbs without leaking to the atmosphere at pressures greater than 60 cm of H2O.

METHODS: Patients were enrolled at the emergency department (ED) and outpatient testing centers. Each patient was given a home pulse oximeter and instructed to record their SpO(2) every eight hours. Patients were instructed to return to the ED for sustained home SpO(2) <92% or if they felt they needed emergent medical attention. Relative risk was used to assess the relation between hospitalization and home SpO(2) <92% in COVID\u201019 positive patients. RESULTS: We enrolled 209 patients with suspected COVID\u201019, of which 77 patients tested positive for COVID\u201019 and were included. Subsequent hospitalization occurred in 22\/77 (29%) patients. Resting home SpO(2) <92% was associated with an increased likelihood of hospitalization compared to SpO(2) \u226592% [RR 7.0 (95% CI 3.4 \u2013 14.5), p\u2010value <0.0001]. Home SpO2 <92% was also associated with increased risk of ICU admission, ARDS and septic shock. In our cohort, 50% of patients who ended up hospitalized only returned to the ED for incidental finding of low home SpO(2) without worsening of symptoms. One\u2010third (33%) of non\u2010hospitalized patients stated they would have returned to the ED if they did not have a pulse oximeter to reassure them at home. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that home pulse oximetry monitoring identifies need for hospitalization in initially non\u2010severe COVID\u201019 patients when a cut off of SpO(2) 92% is used.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Several intensive-care units (ICUs) in Wuhan are nonstandard wards that were repurposed from general wards. Considering the shortage of medical resources and the need to prevent nosocomic infection, the respiratory-treatment strategy in these nonstandard ICUs is different from those in general wards and standard ICUs. High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) plays an important role in nonstandard ICUs and is beneficial to the patients therein. PATIENT CONCERNS: In this study, we analyzed four cases of HFNC-treated patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a makeshift ICU and summarized our experience. DIAGNOSES: Four patients diagnosed with COVID-19 according to World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance were admitted to the makeshift ICU. INTERVENTIONS: All patients had oxygen treatment with HFNC, as well as regular treatment of antivirals and traditional Chinese medicine. OUTCOMES: Two patients survived after treatment, while the other two died from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and heart failure, respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with severe and critical COVID-19 often have poor prognoses after mechanical ventilation, exhibiting corresponding complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and deep-vein thrombosis, which significantly prolongs length of stay in the ICU. HFNC could prevent intubation in some patients, thereby avoiding the above complications; however, this needs confirmation in further clinical studies. This treatment reduced difficulty and workloads for healthcare professionals, had good tolerability for patients, might not significantly increase the risk of infection for healthcare professionals, and do not require additional preventive measures against nosocomic infection. HFNC treatment has its advantages in providing oxygen therapy in COVID-19, but healthcare professionals should still pay close attention to changes in patients\u2019 oxygenation rates and respiratory frequency.",

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a resource-intensive and potentially life-saving modality in severe respiratory failure, has generally not been included in proactive disaster preparedness until recently. This paper explores underlying assumptions and triage principles that could guide the integration of ECMO resources into existing disaster planning. Drawing from a collaborative framework developed by one US metropolitan area with multiple adult and pediatric extracorporeal life support centers, this paper aims to inform decision-making around ECMO use during a pandemic such as COVID-19.

Increasing the level in assist resulted in a 31% (8-44%) decrease in inspiratory effort and a 10% (0-18%) decrease in respiratory rate. The change in respiratory rate upon the change in assist correlated modestly with the change in the effort (R = 0.5).

Although the accuracy of esophageal pressure (Pes) to estimate regional pleural pressure (Ppl) has previously been assessed in the supine position, such data are not available in the prone position in ARDS. In six anesthetized, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated female pigs, we measured Pes and Ppl into dorsal and ventral parts of the right pleural cavity. Airway pressure (Paw) and flow were measured at the airway opening. Severe ARDS [arterial partial pressure of oxygen ([Formula: see text])\/fraction of inspired oxygen ([Formula: see text]) < 100 mmHg at positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH(2)O] was induced by surfactant depletion. In supine and prone positions assigned in a random order, PEEP was set to 20, 15, 10, and 5 cmH(2)O and static end-expiratory chest wall pressures were measured from Pes (PEEPtot,es) and dorsal (PEEPtot,PplD) and ventral (PEEPtot,PplV) Ppl. The magnitude of the difference between PEEPtot,es and PEEPtot,PplD was similar in each position [\u22123.6 cmH(2)O in supine vs. \u22123.8 cmH(2)O in prone at PEEP 20 cmH(2)O (PEEP 20)]. The difference between PEEPtot,es and PEEPtot,PplV became narrower in the prone position (\u22128.3 cmH(2)O supine vs. \u22123.0 cmH(2)O prone at PEEP 20). PEEPtot,PplV was overestimated by Pes in the prone position at higher pressures. The median (1st\u20133rd quartiles) dorsal-to-ventral Ppl gradient was 4.4 (2.4\u20136.8) cmH(2)O in the supine position and \u22121.5 (\u22123.5 to +1.1) cmH(2)O in the prone position (P < 0.0001) and marginally influenced by PEEP (P = 0.058). Prone position narrowed end-expiratory dorsal-to-ventral Ppl vertical gradient, likely because of a more even distribution of mechanical forces over the chest wall. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In a porcine model of acute respiratory distress syndrome, we found that static end-expiratory esophageal pressure did not change significantly in prone position compared with supine position at any positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) tested between 5 and 20 cmH(2)O. Prone position was associated with an increased ventral pleural pressure and reduced end-expiratory dorsal-to-ventral pleural pressure (Ppl) vertical gradient, likely due to a more even distribution of mechanical forces over the chest wall.",

Most traumatic brain injuries (TBI) have some degree of DAI, especially severe TBI. Computed tomography (CT) remains the first imaging test performed in the acute phase of TBI, but has low sensitivity for detecting DAI, since DAI is a cellular lesion. The aim of this study is to search in the literature for CT signs, in the first 24 h after TBI, that may help to differentiate patients in groups with a better versus worst prognosis. METHODS: We searched for primary scientific articles in the PubMed database, in English, indexed since January 1st, 2000. RESULTS: Five articles were selected for review. In the DAI group, traffic accidents accounted 70% of the cases, 79% were male, and the mean age was 41 years. There was an association between DAI and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (tSAH); an association between the IVH grade and number of corpus callosum lesions; and an association between blood in the interpeduncular cisterns (IPC) and brainstem lesions. CONCLUSION: In closed TBI with no tSAH, severe DAI is unlikely. Similarly, in the absence of IVH, any DAI is unlikely. If there is IVH, patients generally are clinically worse; and the more ventricles affected, the worse the prognosis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging advanced health systems, which are dealing with an overwhelming number of patients in need of intensive care for respiratory failure, often requiring intubation. Prone positioning in intubated patients is known to reduce mortality in moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. We aimed to investigate feasibility and effect on gas exchange of prone positioning in awake, non-intubated patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia. METHODS: In this prospective, feasibility, cohort study, patients aged 18\u201375 years with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19-related pneumonia receiving supplemental oxygen or non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure were recruited from San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy. We collected baseline data on demographics, anthropometrics, arterial blood gas, and ventilation parameters. After baseline data collection, patients were helped into the prone position, which was maintained for a minimum duration of 3 h. Clinical data were re-collected 10 min after prone positioning and 1 h after returning to the supine position. The main study outcome was the variation in oxygenation (partial pressure of oxygen [PaO(2)]\/fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air [FiO(2)]) between baseline and resupination, as an index of pulmonary recruitment. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04365959, and is now complete. FINDINGS: Between March 20 and April 9, 2020, we enrolled 56 patients, of whom 44 (79%) were male; the mean age was 57\u00b74 years (SD 7\u00b74) and the mean BMI was 27\u00b75 kg\/m(2) (3\u00b77). Prone positioning was feasible (ie, maintained for at least 3 h) in 47 patients (83\u00b79% [95% CI 71\u00b77 to 92\u00b74]). Oxygenation substantially improved from supine to prone positioning (PaO(2)\/FiO(2) ratio 180\u00b75 mm Hg [SD 76\u00b76] in supine position vs 285\u00b75 mm Hg [112\u00b79] in prone position; p<0\u00b70001). After resupination, improved oxygenation was maintained in 23 patients (50\u00b70% [95% CI 34\u00b79\u201365\u00b71]; ie, responders); however, this improvement was on average not significant compared with before prone positioning (PaO(2)\/FiO(2) ratio 192\u00b79 mm Hg [100\u00b79] 1 h after resupination; p=0\u00b729). Patients who maintained increased oxygenation had increased levels of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein: 12\u00b77 mg\/L [SD 6\u00b79] in responders vs 8\u00b74 mg\/L [6\u00b72] in non-responders; and platelets: 241\u00b71 \u00d7 10(3)\/\u03bcL [101\u00b79] vs 319\u00b78 \u00d7 10(3)\/\u03bcL [120\u00b76]) and shorter time between admission to hospital and prone positioning (2\u00b77 days [SD 2\u00b71] in responders vs 4\u00b76 days [3\u00b77] in non-responders) than did those for whom improved oxygenation was not maintained. 13 (28%) of 46 patients were eventually intubated, seven (30%) of 23 responders and six (26%) of 23 non-responders (p=0\u00b774). Five patients died during follow-up due to underlying disease, unrelated to study procedure. INTERPRETATION: Prone positioning was feasible and effective in rapidly ameliorating blood oxygenation in awake patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia requiring oxygen supplementation. The effect was maintained after resupination in half of the patients. Further studies are warranted to ascertain the potential benefit of this technique in improving final respiratory and global outcomes. FUNDING: University of Milan-Bicocca.",

DISCUSSION: In severe cases, COVID-19 leads to hypoxemic respiratory failure that may meet criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The mainstay of treatment for ARDS includes a lung protective ventilation strategy with low tidal volumes (4\u20138 mL\/kg predicted body weight), adequate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and maintaining a plateau pressure of < 30 cm H(2)O. While further COVID-19 specific studies are needed, current management should focus on supportive care, preventing further lung injury from mechanical ventilation, and treating the underlying cause.

Severe bilateral pneumonia is the main feature of severe COVID-19, and adequate ventilatory support is crucial for patient survival. Although our knowledge of the disease is still rapidly increasing, this review summarizes current guidance on the best provision of ventilatory support, with a focus on resource-limited settings. Key messages include that supplemental oxygen is a first essential step for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients with hypoxemia and should be a primary focus in resource-limited settings where capacity for invasive ventilation is limited. Oxygen delivery can be increased by using a non-rebreathing mask and prone positioning. The presence of only hypoxemia should in general not trigger intubation because hypoxemia is often remarkably well tolerated. Patients with fatigue and at risk for exhaustion, because of respiratory distress, will require invasive ventilation. In these patients, lung protective ventilation is essential. Severe pneumonia in COVID-19 differs in some important aspects from other causes of severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, and limiting the positive end-expiratory pressure level on the ventilator may be important. This ventilation strategy might reduce the currently very high case fatality rate of more than 50% in invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and disabling disease with high rates of mortality and morbidity. The role of steroids in treating ARDS remains controversial. We aim to examine the evidence behind using glucocorticoids in the management of ARDS from the available studies. METHODS: We performed a literature review of major electronic databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing glucocorticoids versus placebo in treating patients with ARDS. Our primary outcome was hospital mortality. Other outcomes included ICU mortality, number of ventilator-free days at day 28, incidence of nosocomial infections, and hyperglycemia. We performed a meta-analysis using a random effects model to calculate risk ratios (RR) and mean difference (MD) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). A subsequent trial sequential analysis was performed to examine the strength of evidence and to guard against statistical type I and type II errors for our results. RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included in the final analysis totaling of 1091 patients, with a mean age of 57 \u00b1 16, and 56.2% were male. In our pooled analysis, use of glucocorticoids was associated with a significant reduction in hospital mortality (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.64\u20130.98; P = 0.03) and ICU mortality (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.42\u20130.97; P = 0.04). Furthermore, glucocorticoid use was associated with an increased number of ventilator-free days at day 28 (MD 4.06 days; 95% CI 2.66\u20135.45; P < 0.01). Regarding adverse events, glucocorticoids use was not associated with an increased risk for nosocomial infections (RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.68\u20131.00; P = 0.05); however, it was associated with an increased risk of hyperglycemia (RR 1.11; 95% CI 1.01\u20131.24; P = 0.04). In our trial sequential analysis, the required diversity-adjusted information size (sample size = 2692 patients) was not reached, and the evidence was insufficient from the available RCTs. CONCLUSION: Among patients with ARDS, use of glucocorticoids is associated with a significant reduction in mortality and duration of mechanical ventilation, without increased risk of hospital-acquired infections. However, based on a trial sequential analysis, these findings may be secondary to a false-positive (type I) error. Further studies are needed for a firm conclusion with guarding against possible statistical errors.",

The purpose of this manuscript is to review our initial clinical experience in 32 patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated with ECMO. A multi-institutional registry and database was created and utilized to assess all patients who were supported with ECMO provided by SpecialtyCare. Data captured included patient characteristics, pre-COVID-19 risk factors and comorbidities, confirmation of COVID-19 diagnosis, features of ECMO support, specific medications utilized to treat COVID-19, and short-term outcomes through hospital discharge. This analysis includes all of our patients with COVID-19 supported with ECMO, with an analytic window starting March 17, 2020, when our first COVID-19 patient was placed on ECMO, and ending April 9, 2020. During the 24 days of this study, 32 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were placed on ECMO at nine different hospitals. As of the time of analysis, 17 remain on ECMO, 10 died before or shortly after decannulation, and five are alive and extubated after removal from ECMO, with one of these five discharged from the hospital. Adjunctive medication in the surviving patients while on ECMO was as follows: four of five survivors received intravenous steroids, three of five survivors received antiviral medications (Remdesivir), two of five survivors were treated with anti-interleukin-6-receptor monoclonal antibodies (Tocilizumab or Sarilumab), and one of five survivors received hydroxychloroquine. An analysis of 32 COVID-19 patients with severe pulmonary compromise supported with ECMO suggests that ECMO may play a useful role in salvaging select critically ill patients with COVID-19. Additional patient experience and associated clinical and laboratory data must be obtained to further define the optimal role of ECMO in patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These initial data may provide useful information to help define the best strategies to care for these challenging patients and may also provide a framework for much-needed future research about the use of ECMO to treat patients with COVID-19.",

The current article aims to deliver a design of an inexpensive BiPAP with an infection-free exhaust. BiPAP is a mode of ventilation which maintains positive pressure for air intake, and a low or zero pressure is created for expiration. The BiPAP suggested in the current article uses an air blower connected to an Arduino via a speed controller, the level of pressure and breathing rate are programmed in the Arduino, thus, the blower functions in BiPAP mode. The 3D printed mask proposed here comprises of a unique design for the intake and exhalation of air; and comprises of two sizes to fit all adults while avoiding any leakage.

In 2017, the Montreux Consensus defined diagnostic criteria for ARDS in the neonatal period. The management of ARDS includes strict adherence to lung-protective ventilation strategies and therapeutic agents to improve gas exchange. We report two similar cases of premature infants with gestational ages of 23 and 24 weeks diagnosed with neonatal ARDS according to the Montreux definition. These patients developed acute worsening of oxygenation on the 30th and 28th day of life, respectively, while they were ventilated on volume-guarantee assist\/control mode. Chest X-rays revealed bilateral diffuse opacity, there were no cardiogenic origins for pulmonary edema, and their oxygenation indexes were >8. Both cases fulfilled the neonatal ARDS criteria and the patients' clinical conditions were associated with late onset neonatal sepsis. After lung recruitment maneuver, the infants began HFO volume-guarantee ventilation and received surfactant treatment. Since they showed a poor short-term response, intratracheal surfactant of 100 mg\/kg plus budesonide of 0.25 mg\/kg were administered and their oxygenation indexes were reduced stepwise. Both patients survived and were discharged home with spontaneous breathing of room air. Neonatal ARDS is generally an underdiagnosed condition associated with sepsis, pneumonia, and meconium aspiration. Impaired surfactant activity and reduced lung compliance play important roles in its pathophysiology. To our knowledge, this is the first case report indicating the possible therapeutic role of budesonide plus surfactant in ARDS treatment. Since ARDS is an entity not recognized in newborns, we want to emphasize neonatal ARDS diagnosis and underline that the combination of budesonide and surfactant may be a novel therapeutic option in the treatment of ARDS.",

        "doi": "10.7759\/cureus.7849",
        "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness caused by the highly infectious novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus spread by droplet transmission. Consequently, the use of respiratory devices that may potentially promote aerosolization like non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for diseases such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), advanced chronic obstructive lung disease, pulmonary hypertension (PH), and neuromuscular respiratory disease has been called into question. We present a case of a patient with history of OSA and PH convalescing from refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 who was successfully extubated to average volume-assured pressure support (AVAPS). A 74-year-old male with medical history notable for OSA on NIPPV, PH, and hypertension presented with respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 confirmed on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. His respiratory status worsened leading to ARDS requiring intubation. He was initially extubated to high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) due to hospital policy to avoid NIPPV due to concerns of viral dissemination. He did not tolerate HFNC and required re-intubation for prolonged period. He was then medically optimized for a second attempt and extubated two days later to AVAPS with an anti-viral filter and negative pressure room with a goal of optimizing his critical illness myopathy and pre-existing OSA and PH. He tolerated extubation well, and over the next five days was weaned from alternating AVAPS\/HFNC to eventually requiring two liters nasal cannula in the day and AVAPS mode at night. This case highlights a potential therapeutic option for patients with severe respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. This patient\u2019s pre-existing comorbidities of OSA and PH markedly increased his risk for extubation failure on HFNC. The use of AVAPS after his second extubation attempt helped ensure ventilation and oxygenation non-invasively. COVID-19 can lead to prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation. This pandemic has the potential to create medical resource scarcities, especially in rural areas where ventilators and trained personnel are already in short supply. By using AVAPS mode, this patient was able to rehabilitate his myopathy and participate in intermittent weaning of HFNC to ultimately simple nasal cannula. AVAPS is useful tool to facilitate extubation, as it allows non-invasive support of respiratory dynamics, particularly in those with co-morbidities such as OSA and PH. Further, larger scale studies are needed to determine its exact role during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

CONCLUSION: Treatment of severe pneumonia in COVID\u201019 by ECMO should recognize lung plasticity considering time to ECMO introduction and interstitial biomarkers.

Providing complex therapies such as ECMO during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases has unique challenges. Careful planning, judicious resource allocation, and training of personnel to provide complex therapeutic interventions while adhering to strict infection control measures are all crucial components of an ECMO action plan. ECMO can be initiated in specialist centres, or patients can receive ECMO during transportation from a centre that is not specialised for this procedure to an expert ECMO centre. Ensuring that systems enable safe and coordinated movement of critically ill patients, staff, and equipment is important to improve ECMO access.

While it is well established that ICU-acquired weakness severely impairs long-term prognosis, the association of diaphragm dysfunction with this outcome has never been reported. This study investigated whether diaphragm dysfunction is associated with negative long-term outcomes and whether the coexistence of diaphragm dysfunction and ICU-acquired weakness has a particular association with 2-year survival and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). METHODS: This study is an ancillary study derived from an observational cohort study. Patients under mechanical ventilation were enrolled at the time of their first spontaneous breathing trial. Diaphragm dysfunction was defined by tracheal pressure generated by phrenic nerve stimulation < 11 cmH(2)O and ICU-acquired weakness was defined by Medical Research Council (MRC) score < 48. HRQOL was evaluated with the SF-36 questionnaire. RESULTS: Sixty-nine of the 76 patients enrolled in the original study were included in the survival analysis and 40 were interviewed. Overall 2-year survival was 67% (46\/69): 64% (29\/45) in patients with diaphragm dysfunction, 71% (17\/24) in patients without diaphragm dysfunction, 46% (11\/24) in patients with ICU-acquired weakness and 76% (34\/45) in patients without ICU-acquired weakness. Patients with concomitant diaphragm dysfunction and ICU-acquired weakness had a poorer outcome with a 2-year survival rate of 36% (5\/14) compared to patients without diaphragm function and ICU-acquired weakness [79% (11\/14) (p < 0.01)]. Health-related quality of life was not influenced by the presence of ICU-acquired weakness, diaphragm dysfunction or their coexistence. CONCLUSIONS: ICU-acquired weakness but not diaphragm dysfunction was associated with a poor 2-year survival of critically ill patients.",

METHODS: A statewide multi\u2010institutional collaborative for COVID\u201019 patients was utilized to obtain clinical data on the first 10 critically ill COVID\u201019 patients who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). RESULTS: Of the first 10 patients that required ECMO for COVID\u201019, the age ranged from 31 to 62 years with the majority (70%) being men. Seven (70%) had comorbidities. The majority (80%) of patients had known sick contact and exposure to COVID\u201019 positive patients or traveled to pandemic areas inside the United States within the 2 weeks before symptom onset. None of the patients were healthcare workers. The most common symptoms leading to the presentation were high fever \u2265103\u00b0F (90%), cough (80%) and dyspnea (70%), followed by fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms (both 30%), myalgia, loss of taste, pleuritic chest pain, and confusion (all 10%). All patients had bilateral infiltrates on chest X\u2010rays suggestive of interstitial viral pneumonia. All patients were cannulated in the venovenous configuration. Two (20%) patients were successfully liberated from ECMO support after 7 and 10 days, respectively, and one (10%) patient is currently on a weaning course.

Neck circumference (NC) has been shown to be strongly related to cardiometabolic and respiratory illnesses even after adjustment for body mass index (BMI). We performed a prospective study to investigate the potential of NC to predict the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in adult COVID\u201019 inpatients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively and consecutively enrolled COVID\u201019 adult patients admitted to dedicated medical wards of two Italian hospitals from 25 March to 7 April 2020. On admission, clinical, biochemical and anthropometric data, including BMI and NC were collected. As primary outcome measure, the maximum respiratory support received was evaluated. Follow\u2010up time was 30 days from hospital admission. RESULTS: We enrolled 132 subjects (55.0\u201075.8 years, 32% female). During the study period, 26 (19.7%) patients underwent IMV. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension and COPD, NC resulted independently and significantly associated with IMV risk (adjusted OR 1.260\u2014per 1 cm increase 95% CI:1.120\u20101.417; P < .001), with a stronger association in the subgroup with BMI \u226430 Kg\/m(2) (adjusted OR 1.526; 95% CI:1.243\u20101.874; P < .001). NC showed a good discrimination power in predicting patients requiring IMV (AUC 0.783; 95% CI:0.684\u20100.882; P < .001). In particular, NC > 40.5 cm (>37.5 for females and >42.5 for males) showed a higher and earlier IMV risk compared to subjects with lower NC (Log\u2010rank test: P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: NC is an easy to measure parameter able to predict the need for IMV in adult COVID\u201019 inpatients.",

This study aimed to describe specific pathophysiological characteristics of acute respiratory distress syndrome from coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Prospective crossover physiologic study. SETTING: ICU of a university-affiliated hospital from northern Italy dedicated to care of patients with confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019. PATIENTS: Ten intubated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS: We performed a two-step positive end-expiratory pressure trial with change of 10 cm H(2)O in random order. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At each positive end-expiratory pressure level, we assessed arterial blood gases, respiratory mechanics, ventilation inhomogeneity, and potential for lung recruitment by electrical impedance tomography. Potential for lung recruitment was assessed by the recently described recruitment to inflation ratio. In a subgroup of seven paralyzed patients, we also measured ventilation-perfusion mismatch at lower positive end-expiratory pressure by electrical impedance tomography. At higher positive end-expiratory pressure, respiratory mechanics did not change significantly: compliance remained relatively high with low driving pressure. Oxygenation and ventilation inhomogeneity improved but arterial co(2) increased despite unchanged respiratory rate and tidal volume. The recruitment to inflation ratio presented median value higher than previously reported in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients but with large variability (median, 0.79 [0.53\u20131.08]; range, 0.16\u20131.40). The Fio(2) needed to obtain viable oxygenation at lower positive end-expiratory pressure was significantly correlated with the recruitment to inflation ratio (r = 0.603; p = 0.05). The ventilation-perfusion mismatch was elevated (median, 34% [32\u201345%] of lung units) and, in six out of seven patients, ventilated nonperfused units represented a much larger proportion than perfused nonventilated ones. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome from coronavirus disease 2019, potential for lung recruitment presents large variability, while elevated dead space fraction may be a specific pathophysiological trait. These findings may guide selection of personalized mechanical ventilation settings.",

DESIGN: Retrospective observational analysis at a single center. SETTING: Tertiary referral university teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-related severe acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy with an injected CT scan performed after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation retrieval. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 13 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 patients requiring venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. All of these patients experienced venous thromboembolism: 10 patients (76.9%) had isolated cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis, two patients (15.4%) had isolated pulmonary embolism, and one patient (7.7%) had both cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Eleven patients (84.6%) had cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis. A jugular associated cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis was identified in seven patients (53.8%), a femoral associated cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis was identified in 10 patients (76.9%), and six patients (46.2%) had both femoral and jugular cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis. A pulmonary embolism was found in three patients (23.1%). No patient had central venous catheter-related deep vein thrombosis. One patient had thrombotic occlusion of the centrifugal pump, and one had oxygenator thrombosis requiring circuit replacement. Three patients (23.1%) had significant bleeding. Three patients (23.1%) had laboratory-confirmed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and all of them developed cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis. These three patients had femoral cannula-associated deep vein thrombosis, and two had an oxygenator or pump thrombosis. The mean activated partial thromboplastin time ratio was higher in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 group than in the influenza group and the community-acquired pneumonia group (1.91 vs 1.48 vs 1.53; p = 0.001), which was also found in regard to the percentage of patients with an activated partial thromboplastin time ratio greater than 1.8 (47.8% vs 20% vs 20.9%; p = 0.003) and the mean prothrombin ratio (86.3 vs 61.6 vs 67.1; p = 0.003).

NIV includes Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and Bi-Level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP). CPAP is the method of choice with the use of BiPAP for those with complex respiratory conditions who contract COVID-19. The use of High Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO) remains contentious with different perspectives in how this modality can be used to treat respiratory failure in COVID-19. Current thinking suggests that NIV and HFNO may be an appropriate bridging adjunct in the early part of the disease progress and may prevent the need for intubation or invasive ventilation. Patients requiring NIV or HFNO may be nursed in locations outside of the critical care unit. Therefore, this article reviews the different types of NIV and HFNO, indications and the nursing care.",

        "abstract": "The global COVID\u201019 pandemic has led to a worldwide shortage of ventilators. This shortage has initiated discussions on how to support multiple patients with a single ventilator (ventilator splitting). Ventilator splitting is incompletely tested, experimental and the effects have not been fully characterised. This study investigated the effect of ventilator splitting on system variables (inspiratory pressure, flow and volume) and the possibility of different ventilation targets for each limb using only standard hospital equipment. Experiments were conducted on two test lungs with different compliances (0.02 l.cmH(2)O(\u22121) and 0.04 l.cmH(2)O(\u22121)). The ventilator was used in both pressure and volume control modes and was set to ventilate the low compliance lungs at end\u2010tidal volumes of 500 \u00b1 20 ml. A flow restrictor apparatus consisting of a Hoffman clamp and tracheal tube was connected in series to the inspiratory limb of the high compliance test lungs and the resistance modified to achieve end\u2010tidal volumes of 500 \u00b1 20 ml. The restriction apparatus successfully modified the inspiratory pressure, minute ventilation and volume delivered to the high compliance test lungs in both pressure control (27.3\u201317.8 cmH(2)O, 15.2\u20138.0 l.min(\u22121) and 980\u2013499 ml, respectively) and volume control (21.0\u201316.7 cmH(2)O, 10.7\u20137.9 l.min(\u22121) and 659\u2013498 ml, respectively) ventilation modes. Ventilator splitting is not condoned by the authors. However, these experiments demonstrate the capacity to simultaneously ventilate two test lungs of different compliances, and using only standard hospital equipment, modify the delivered pressure, flow and volume in each test lung.",

        "abstract": "In its severe manifestation, COVID-19 compromises oxygenation in a manner that is refractory to maximal conventional support and requires escalation to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Maintaining ECMO support for extended durations requires a delicately balanced anticoagulation strategy to maintain circuit viability by preventing thrombus deposition, while avoiding excessive anticoagulation yielding hemorrhage; a task that is complicated in COVID-19 secondary to an inherent hypercoagulable state. Bivalirudin, a member of the direct thrombin inhibitor drug class, offers potential advantages during ECMO including to its ability to exert its effect by directly attaching to and inhibiting freely circulating and fibrin-bound thrombin. Herein, we report the successful use of an anticoagulation strategy employing the off-label use of a continuous infusion of bivalirudin in a case of severe hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure caused by COVID-19 requiring VV-ECMO. Importantly, therapeutic anticoagulation intensity was rapidly achieved with stable pharmacokinetics and there was no need for any circuit interventions throughout the patient's 27 day ECMO course. In COVID-19, bivalirudin offers a potential option for maintaining systemic anticoagulation during ECMO in a manner that may mitigate the pro-thrombotic nature of the underlying pathophysiologic state.",

DATA SOURCES: Retrospective chart review. STUDY SELECTION\/DATA EXTRACTION: Twenty-one consecutive patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019-associated hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Initial ventilator parameters were positive end-expiratory pressure 14 cm H(2)o and target plateau pressure 29 cm H(2)o to maximize lung recruitment. Methylprednisolone (125 mg every 6hr for 24 hr with tapering to 60 mg every 12 hr) was administered shortly after patients were intubated (median 11 hr after intubation). DATA SYNTHESIS: No patient in the cohort died while hospitalized (mortality, 0%; 95% CI, 0%\u201318%) and 18 patients have been discharged from the acute care setting. Twenty of 21 patients (95%) have been liberated from mechanical ventilation after a median duration of 8 days (range, 4\u201330 d). Following 48 hours of methylprednisolone, the A-a o(2) gradient decreased from 455 \u00b1 103 to 228 \u00b1 109 mm Hg (difference 227 \u00b1 108 mm Hg; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our positive experience with tocilizumab in combination with methylprednisolone started early after endotracheal intubation may be one avenue for reducing the morbidity and mortality seen with severe coronavirus disease 2019 and merits further exploration in clinical studies.",

        "doi": "10.1186\/s13613-020-00675-7",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A large proportion of patients with a SARS-Cov-2-associated respiratory failure develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It has been recently suggested that SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS may differ from usual non-SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS by higher respiratory system compliance (C(RS)), lower potential for recruitment with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) contrasting with severe shunt fraction. The purpose of the study was to systematically assess respiratory mechanics and recruitability in SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS. METHODS: Gas exchanges, C(RS) and hemodynamics were assessed at 2 levels of PEEP (15 cmH(2)O and 5 cmH(2)O) within 36 h (day1) and from 4 to 6 days (day 5) after intubation. The recruited volume was computed as the difference between the volume expired from PEEP 15 to 5 cmH(2)O and the volume predicted by compliance at PEEP 5 cmH(2)O (or above airway opening pressure). The recruitment-to-inflation (R\/I) ratio (i.e. the ratio between the recruited lung compliance and C(RS) at PEEP 5 cmH(2)O) was used to assess lung recruitability. A R\/I ratio value higher than or equal to 0.5 was used to define highly recruitable patients. RESULTS: The R\/I ratio was calculated in 25 of the 26 enrolled patients at day 1 and in 15 patients at day 5. At day 1, 16 (64%) were considered as highly recruitable (R\/I ratio median [interquartile range] 0.7 [0.55\u20130.94]) and 9 (36%) were considered as poorly recruitable (R\/I ratio 0.41 [0.31\u20130.48]). The PaO(2)\/FiO(2) ratio at PEEP 15 cmH(2)O was higher compared to PEEP 5 cmH(2)O only in highly recruitable patients (173 [139\u2013236] vs 135 [89\u2013167] mmHg; p < 0.01). Neither PaO(2)\/FiO(2) or C(RS) measured at PEEP 15 cmH(2)O or at PEEP 5 cmH(2)O nor changes in PaO(2)\/FiO(2) or C(RS) in response to PEEP changes allowed to identify highly or poorly recruitable patients. CONCLUSION: In this series of 25 patients with SARS-Cov-2 associated ARDS, 64% were considered as highly recruitable and only 36% as poorly recruitable based on the R\/I ratio performed on the day of intubation. This observation suggests that a systematic R\/I ratio assessment may help to guide initial PEEP titration to limit harmful effect of unnecessary high PEEP in the context of Covid-19 crisis.",

We report here on benefits of CPAP treatment in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. A 63-year-old patient of African origin presented to the emergency room with COVID-19 pneumonia. Fever had started 5 days before her admission. On day 4, rapid clinical deterioration associated to a high respiratory rate and increased oxygen requirements was noted. The patient was working in an intensive care unit and refused to be intubated. Oxygen was administered at a rate of 15 litres per minute via a Boussignac valve, which initially restored normal oxygen saturation, but this treatment was poorly tolerated and the patient withdrew it after 2 h. A CPAP set at a pressure of 8 cm of water (Goodknight\u00ae) was then introduced with better tolerance, allowing the patient to wear it almost continuously for more than 38 h. The patient also benefited from the administration of methypredinsolone 40 mg. Concerning tolerance, a substantial advantage was noted for CPAP machine compared to the Boussignac valve with in addition, a clear decrease in respiratory rate. We would like to encourage the use of CPAP, better tolerated for extended hours with lower oxygen flows, in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, where acute respiratory distress all too often leads to patient intubation and the genesis of deleterious lung lesions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Early mobilization of adults receiving intensive care improves health outcomes, yet little is known about mobilization practices in paediatric intensive care units (PICUs). We aimed to determine the prevalence of and factors associated with physical rehabilitation in PICUs across Europe. METHODS: A 2-day, cross-sectional, multicentre point prevalence study was conducted in May and November 2018. The primary outcome was the prevalence of physical therapy (PT)- or occupational therapy (OT)-provided mobility. Clinical data and data on patient mobility, potential mobility safety events, and mobilization barriers were prospectively collected in patients admitted for \u226572 h. RESULTS: Data of 456 children admitted to one of 38 participating PICUs from 15 European countries were collected (456 patient days); 70% were under 3 years of age. The point prevalence of PT- and\/or OT-provided mobility activities was 39% (179\/456) (95% CI 34.7\u201343.9%) during the patient days, with significant differences between European regions. Nurses were involved in 72% (924\/1283) of the mobility events; in the remaining 28%, PT\/OT, physicians, family members, or other professionals were involved. Of the factors studied, family presence was most strongly positively associated with out-of-bed mobilization (aOR 7.83, 95% CI 3.09\u201319.79). Invasive mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube was negatively associated with out-of-bed mobility (aOR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12\u20130.68). Patients were completely immobile on 25% (115\/456) of patient days. Barriers to mobilization were reported on 38% of patient days. The most common reported patient-related barriers were cardiovascular instability (n = 47, 10%), oversedation (n = 39, 9%), and medical contraindication (n = 37, 8%). Potential safety events occurred in 6% of all documented mobilization events. CONCLUSION: Therapists are infrequently consulted for mobilization of critically ill children in European PICUs. This study highlights the need for a systematic and interdisciplinary mobilization approach for critically ill children. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: [Image: see text]",

        "abstract": "For years, the use of ketamine as an anesthetic to patients suffering from acute brain injury has been debated because of its possible deleterious effects on the cerebral circulation and thus on the cerebral perfusion. Early studies suggested that ketamine could increase the intracranial pressure thus lowering the cerebral perfusion and hence reduce the oxygen supply to the injured brain. However, more recent studies are less conclusive and might even indicate that patients with acute brain injury could benefit from ketamine sedation. This systematic review summarizes the evidence regarding the use of ketamine in patients suffering from traumatic brain injury. Databases were searched for studies using ketamine in acute brain injury. Outcomes of interest were mortality, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, blood pressure, heart rate, spreading depolarizations, and neurological function. In total 11 studies were included. The overall level of evidence concerning the use of ketamine in brain injury is low. Only two studies found a small increase in intracranial pressure, while two small studies found decreased levels of intracranial pressure following ketamine administration. We found no evidence of harm during ketamine use in patients suffering from acute brain injury.",

METHODS: Non a priori designed secondary analysis of a prospectively enrolled cohort study subjects <12 h of life between 24(0) and 29(6) weeks gestation. Cerebral saturations (rScO2) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) were continuously monitored every 30 s for 96 h. ICA was defined by a 10 min epoch rScO2-MAP correlation coefficient of >0.5. RESULTS: Twenty-three of 61 subjects (38%) required dopamine. Time spent with ICA was 23% in dopamine-exposed subjects vs. 14% in those not exposed (p = 0.0001). On the epoch level, time spent with ICA was 15%, 29%, 34%, 37%, and 23% in epochs with dopamine titration of 0, 1\u20135, 6\u201310, 11\u201315, and 16\u201320 \u03bcg\/kg\/min, respectively.

METHODS: We retrospectively screened 318 confirmed patients with NCIP in two hospitals of Chongqing, China, from January 1st to March 4th, 2020. Among them, 27 (8.4%) patients experienced severe acute respiratory failure including 17 patients (63%) treated with HFNC as first-line therapy, 9 patients (33%) treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and one patient (4%) treated with invasive ventilation. HFNC failure was defined by the need of NIV or intubation as rescue therapy. RESULTS: Of the 17 HFNC patients, 7 (41%) experienced HFNC failure. The HFNC failure rate was 0% (0\/6) in patients with PaO(2)\/FiO(2) > 200 mm Hg vs. 63% (7\/11) in those with PaO(2)\/FiO(2) \u2264 200 mm Hg (p = 0.04).

However, it did not in the unsuccessful group. After initiation of NIV as rescue therapy among the 7 patients with HFNC failure, PaO(2)\/FiO(2) significantly improved after 1\u20132 h of NIV [median 172 (150\u2013208) mmHg vs. 114 (IQR: 79\u2013130) under HFNC, p = 0.04]. However, two out of seven (29%) patients with NIV as rescue therapy ultimately received intubation. Among the 27 patients with severe acute respiratory failure, four patients were eventually intubated (15%).

In a substantial number of patients, adequate arterial oxygenation cannot be achieved with supplementary oxygen therapy alone. To date, there has been no clear guideline endorsement of ward-based non-invasive pressure support (NIPS) for severely hypoxic patients who are deemed unlikely to benefit from invasive ventilation. We established a ward-based NIPS service for COVID-19 PCR-positive patients, with severe hypoxia, and in whom escalation to critical care for invasive ventilation was not deemed appropriate. A retrospective analysis of survival in these patients was undertaken. Twenty-eight patients were included. Ward-based NIPS for severe hypoxia was associated with a 50% survival in this cohort. This compares favourably with Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre survival data following invasive ventilation in a less frail, less comorbid and younger population. These results suggest that ward-based NIPS should be considered as a treatment option in an integrated escalation strategy in all units managing respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19.",

        "abstract": "Strategies to split ventilators to support multiple patients requiring ventilatory support have been proposed and used in emergency cases in which shortages of ventilators cannot otherwise be remedied by production or procurement strategies. However, the current approaches to ventilator sharing lack the ability to individualize ventilation to each patient, measure pulmonary mechanics, and accommodate rebalancing of the airflow when one patient improves or deteriorates, posing safety concerns to patients. Potential cross-contamination, lack of alarms, insufficient monitoring, and inability to adapt to sudden changes in patient status have prevented widespread acceptance of ventilator sharing. We have developed an individualized system for augmenting ventilator efficacy (iSAVE) as a rapidly deployable platform that uses a single ventilator to simultaneously and more safely support two subjects. The iSAVE enables subject-specific volume and pressure control and the rebalancing of ventilation in response to improvement or deterioration in an individual\u2019s respiratory status. The iSAVE incorporates mechanisms to measure pulmonary mechanics, mitigate cross-contamination and backflow, and accommodate sudden flow changes due to subject interdependencies within the respiratory circuit. We demonstrate these capacities through validation using closed- and open-circuit ventilators on linear test lungs. We show that the iSAVE can temporarily ventilate two pigs on one ventilator as efficaciously as each pig on its own ventilator. By leveraging off-the-shelf medical components, the iSAVE could rapidly expand the ventilation capacity of healthcare facilities during emergency situations such as pandemics.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patient selection and cannulation arguably represent the key steps for the successful implementation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Cannulation is traditionally performed in the operating room or the catheterization laboratory for a number of reasons, including physician preference and access to real\u2010time imaging, with the goal of minimizing complications and ensuring appropriate cannula positioning. Nonetheless, the patients' critical and unstable conditions often require emergent initiation of ECMO and preclude the safe transport of the patient to a procedural suite. AIMS: Therefore, with the objective of avoiding delay with the initiation of therapy and reducing the hazard of transport, we implemented a protocol for bedside ECMO cannulation. MATHERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 89 patients required ECMO support at Hennepin County Medical Center between March 2015 and December 2019. Twenty\u2010eight (31%) required veno\u2010venous support and were all cannulated at the bedside. Overall survival was 71% with no morbidity or mortality related to the cannulation procedure. CONCLUSION: In the current pandemic, the strategy of veno\u2010venous bedside cannulation may have additional benefits for the care of patients with refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus disease\u20102019, decreasing the risk of exposure of health care worker or other patients to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\u20102 occurring during patient transport, preparation, or during disinfection of the procedural suite and the transportation pathway after ECMO cannulation.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: We conducted two World Health Organization-commissioned reviews to inform use of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We synthesized the evidence regarding efficacy and safety (review 1), as well as risks of droplet dispersion, aerosol generation, and associated transmission (review 2) of viral products. SOURCE: Literature searches were performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Chinese databases, and medRxiv. Review 1: we synthesized results from randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HFNC to conventional oxygen therapy (COT) in critically ill patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Review 2: we narratively summarized findings from studies evaluating droplet dispersion, aerosol generation, or infection transmission associated with HFNC. For both reviews, paired reviewers independently conducted screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. We evaluated certainty of evidence using GRADE methodology. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: No eligible studies included COVID-19 patients. Review 1: 12 RCTs (n = 1,989 patients) provided low-certainty evidence that HFNC may reduce invasive ventilation (relative risk [RR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 0.99) and escalation of oxygen therapy (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.98) in patients with respiratory failure. Results provided no support for differences in mortality (moderate certainty), or in-hospital or intensive care length of stay (moderate and low certainty, respectively). Review 2: four studies evaluating droplet dispersion and three evaluating aerosol generation and dispersion provided very low certainty evidence. Two simulation studies and a crossover study showed mixed findings regarding the effect of HFNC on droplet dispersion. Although two simulation studies reported no associated increase in aerosol dispersion, one reported that higher flow rates were associated with increased regions of aerosol density. CONCLUSIONS: High-flow nasal cannula may reduce the need for invasive ventilation and escalation of therapy compared with COT in COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. This benefit must be balanced against the unknown risk of airborne transmission.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Objective of this case report is to draw attention to a less known thrombotic complication associated with COVID-19, i.e., thrombosis of both radial arteries, with possible (long-term) consequences. THE CASE: In our COVID-19 ICU a 49-year-old male patient was admitted, with past medical history of obesity, smoking and diabetes, but no reported atherosclerotic complications. The patient had been admitted with severe hypoxemia and multiple pulmonary emboli were CT-confirmed. ICU-treatment included mechanical ventilation and therapeutic anticoagulation. Preparing the insertion of a new radial artery catheter for invasive blood pressure measurement and blood sampling, we detected that both radial arteries were non-pulsating and occluded: (a) Sonography showed the typical anatomical localization of both radial and ulnar arteries. However, Doppler-derived flow-signals could only be obtained from the ulnar arteries. (b) To test collateral arterial supply of the hand, a pulse-oximeter was placed on the index finger. Thereafter, the ulnar artery at the wrist was compressed. This compression caused an immediate loss of the finger\u2019s pulse-oximetry perfusion signal. The effect was reversible upon release of the ulnar artery. (c) To test for collateral perfusion undetectable by pulse-oximetry, we measured regional oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) of the thenar muscle by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Confirming our findings above, ulnar arterial compression demonstrated that thenar rSO(2) was dependent on ulnar artery flow. The described development of bilateral radial artery occlusion in a relatively young and therapeutically anticoagulated patient with no history of atherosclerosis was unexpected. CONCLUSIONS: Since COVID-19 patients are at increased risk for arterial occlusion, it appears advisable to meticulously check for adequacy of collateral (hand-) perfusion, avoiding the harm of hand ischemia if interventions (e.g., catheterizations) at the radial or ulnar artery are intended.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: As there is no treatment for COVID-19 with a proven mortality benefit at this moment in the pandemic, supportive management including mechanical ventilation is the core management in an intensive care unit (ICU). It is a challenge to provide consistent care in this situation, highly demanding and leading to potential staff shortages in ICU. We need to reduce unnecessary exposure of healthcare workers to the virus. This study aims to examine the impact of care using a non-invasive oscillating device (NIOD) for chest physiotherapy in the care of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19. In particular, we aim to explore if a NIOD performed by non-specialized personnel is not inferior to the standard chest physiotherapy (CPT) undertaken by physiotherapists caring for patients with COVID-19. TRIAL DESIGN: A pilot multicenter prospective crossover noninferiority randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: All mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 admitted to one of the two ICUs, and CPT ordered by the responsible physician. The participants will be recruited from two intensive care units in Canadian Academic Hospitals (one pediatric and one adult ICU). INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: We will implement NIOD and CPT alternatingly for 3 h apart over 3 h. We will apply a pragmatic design, so that other procedures including hypertonic saline nebulization, intermittent positive pressure ventilation, suctioning (e.g., oral or nasal), or changing the ventilator settings or modality (i.e., increasing positive end-expiratory pressure or changing the nasal mask to total face continuous positive airway pressure) can be provided at the direction of bedside intensivists in charge. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome measurement is the oxygenation level before and after the procedure (SpO(2)\/FiO(2) ratio). For cases with invasive ventilation (i.e., the use of an endotracheal tube to deliver positive pressure) and non-invasive ventilation, we will also document expiratory tidal volume, vital signs, and any related complications such as vomiting, hypoxemia, or unexpected extubation. We will collect the data before, 10 min after, and 30 min after the procedure. RANDOMIZATION: The order of the procedures (i.e., NIOD or CPT) will be randomly allocated using manual generated random numbers for each case. Randomization will be carried out by the independent research assistant in the study coordinating center by using opaque sealed envelopes, assigning an equal number of cases to each intervention arm. Stratification will be applied for age (> 18 years or \u2264 18 years of age) and the study sites. BLINDING (MASKING): No blinding will be performed. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): We estimate the necessary sample size as 25 for each arm (total 50 cases), with a power of 0.90 and an alpha of 0.05, with a non-inferiority design. TRIAL STATUS: The protocol version number 1 was approved on 27 March 2020. Currently, recruitment has not yet started, with the start scheduled by the mid-June 2020 and the end anticipated by December 2020. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04361435.

At the end of February, the outburst of the pandemic has hit hard on northern Italian's hospitals. As of today, no data have been published regarding the severity of respiratory failure of patients presenting to the Emergency Departments. Moreover, the outcome the patients forced to undergo Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) or Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV) due to lack of Intensive Care resources is unknown. \u201cPapa Giovanni XXIII\u201d hospital (HPG23) of Bergamo is one of the largest hospitals in the Country, with an Emergency Department (ED) managing over 100,000 patients per year. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study based on chart review of patients presenting to the Emergency Department of HPG23 from 29\/02\/2020 to 10\/03\/2020 with a clinical condition highly suspicious for COVID-19 infection. Registration of admission rates, severity of respiratory failure (ARDS classification), need of respiratory support, SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and outcome of patients treated with a ventilatory support were registered on 10th of May 2020. FINDINGS: From 29\/02 to 10\/03 611 patients with a suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 infection were evaluated in our ED; 320 (52%) met the criteria for hospital admission and 99 (31%) needed to be immediately started on ventilatory support (81% CPAP, 7% NIPPV, 12% Invasive Mechanical Ventilation). Eighty-five (86%) of the 99 patients needing a ventilatory support eventually had SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR test on nasal-pharyngeal swab. Their median PO2\/FiO2 ratio was 128 (IQR 85\u2013168), with 23 patients (29.5%) classified as severe ARDS. Mortality rate as of 10th of May was 76.5%, ranging from 44.4% within patients <60 years old to 85% within those older than 60 years (p = 0.001). NIPPV\/CPAP failure occurred in 91.5% of patients. INTERPRETATION: The population of patients suspected for COVID-19 infection presenting at our ED showed a very high rate of severe respiratory failure, with urgent need of a large amount of intensive care resources. Mortality rates of critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 (76.5%) are similar to previously reported studies with similar population. CPAP\/NIPPV could be a valid strategy to treat severely hypoxic patients that cannot be intubated in the ED due to lack of intensive care resources.

        "abstract": "Abstract BACKGROUND Cerebrospinal fluid leakage in penetrating skull base injury is relatively rare compared to close head injury involving skull base fracture. CASE DESCRIPTION We report a case of a 65-year-old beekeeping man who presented with epistaxis and serous rhinorrhea. When he fell down on the ground near his bee boxes, a garden pole poked into his right nostril. He instantly removed the pole from his nostril by himself. Immediately after the removal of the pole, he developed some nasal bleeding and serous rhinorrhea. He then drove to our emergency room. Computed tomography showed pneumocephalus with minor cerebral contusion in the left frontal lobe, and penetrating injury in the left anterior skull base. His cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage did not resolve spontaneously within one week after the injury under a strict bed rest. We repaired the CSF leakage using a fat (adipose tissue)-on-fascia autograft plug and caulked the defect in the anterior skull base with the fat-on-fascia graft (FFG) plug through the left nostril under endoscopic vision. The CSF rhinorrhea was successfully controlled. Intranasal local application of fluorescein aided in the detection of the flow direction of CSF leakage. CONCLUSIONS Endonasal endoscopic caulking of a skull base defect using FFG plug is useful for CSF leakage due to localized skull base defect, in particular for the post-COVID-19 era, because it is simple, low-cost, and timesaving: requiring no special skills or no sophisticated instruments, thus reducing infection risks during the surgery.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at minimum respiratory elastance during mechanical ventilation (MV) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may improve patient care and outcome. The Clinical utilisation of respiratory elastance (CURE) trial is a two-arm, randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating the performance of PEEP selected at an objective, model-based minimal respiratory system elastance in patients with ARDS. METHODS AND DESIGN: The CURE RCT compares two groups of patients requiring invasive MV with a partial pressure of arterial oxygen\/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2\/FiO2) ratio \u2264 200; one criterion of the Berlin consensus definition of moderate (\u2264 200) or severe (\u2264 100) ARDS. All patients are ventilated using pressure controlled (bi-level) ventilation with tidal volume = 6\u20138 ml\/kg. Patients randomised to the control group will have PEEP selected per standard practice (SPV). Patients randomised to the intervention will have PEEP selected based on a minimal elastance using a model-based computerised method. The CURE RCT is a single-centre trial in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Christchurch hospital, New Zealand, with a target sample size of 320 patients over a maximum of 3 years. The primary outcome is the area under the curve (AUC) ratio of arterial blood oxygenation to the fraction of inspired oxygen over time. Secondary outcomes include length of time of MV, ventilator-free days (VFD) up to 28 days, ICU and hospital length of stay, AUC of oxygen saturation (SpO(2))\/FiO(2) during MV, number of desaturation events (SpO(2) < 88%), changes in respiratory mechanics and chest x-ray index scores, rescue therapies (prone positioning, nitric oxide use, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) and hospital and 90-day mortality. DISCUSSION: The CURE RCT is the first trial comparing significant clinical outcomes in patients with ARDS in whom PEEP is selected at minimum elastance using an objective model-based method able to quantify and consider both inter-patient and intra-patient variability. CURE aims to demonstrate the hypothesized benefit of patient-specific PEEP and attest to the significance of real-time monitoring and decision-support for MV in the critical care environment.

DATA SOURCES: Published experimental studies and clinical papers that address varied aspects of ventilator-induced lung injury pathogenesis and its consequences. STUDY SELECTION: Published information relevant to the novel hypothesis of progressive lung vulnerability and to the biophysical responses of lung injury and repair. DATA EXTRACTION: None. DATA SYNTHESIS: In acute respiratory distress syndrome, the reduced size and capacity for gas exchange of the functioning \u201cbaby lung\u201d imply loss of ventilatory capability that dwindles in proportion to severity of lung injury. Concentrating the entire ventilation workload and increasing perfusion to these already overtaxed units accentuates their potential for progressive injury. Unlike static airspace pressures, which, in theory, apply universally to aerated structures of all dimensions, the components of tidal inflation that relate to power (which include frequency and flow) progressively intensify their tissue-stressing effects on parenchyma and microvasculature as the ventilated compartment shrinks further, especially during the first phase of the evolving injury. This \u201cventilator-induced lung injury vortex\u201d of the shrinking baby lung is opposed by reactive, adaptive, and reparative processes. In this context, relatively little attention has been paid to the evolving interactions between lung injury and response and to the timing of interventions that worsen, limit or reverse a potentially accelerating ventilator-induced lung injury process. Although universal and modifiable drivers hold the potential to progressively injure the functional lung units of acute respiratory distress syndrome in a positive feedback cycle, measures can be taken to interrupt that process and encourage growth and healing of the \u201cbaby lung\u201d of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.",

The mini review provides some insights into the role of supine and prone body positions and summarises the latest understanding of the responsible mechanisms. The scope for discussion is outside the neonatal period and entirely based on experimental and clinical experiences related to adults. The human respiratory system is a complex interplay of many different variables. Therefore, this mini review has prioritised previous and ongoing research to find explanations based on three scientific areas: gravity, lung structure and fractal geometry and vascular regulation. It concludes that gravity is one of the variables responsible for ventilation\/perfusion matching but in concert with lung structure and fractal geometry, ventilation and regulation of lung vascular tone. Since ventilation distribution does not change between supine and prone positions, the higher expression of nitric oxide in dorsal lung vessels than in ventral vessels is likely to be the most important mechanism behind enhanced oxygenation in the prone position.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In obese patients, high closing capacity and low functional residual capacity increase the risk for expiratory alveolar collapse. Constant expiratory flow, as provided by the new flow-controlled ventilation (FCV) mode, was shown to improve lung recruitment. We hypothesized that lung aeration and respiratory mechanics improve in obese patients during FCV. METHODS: We compared FCV and volume-controlled (VCV) ventilation in 23 obese patients in a randomized crossover setting. Starting with baseline measurements, ventilation settings were kept identical except for the ventilation mode related differences (VCV: inspiration to expiration ratio 1:2 with passive expiration, FCV: inspiration to expiration ratio 1:1 with active, linearized expiration). Primary endpoint of the study was the change of end-expiratory lung volume compared to baseline ventilation. Secondary endpoints were the change of mean lung volume, respiratory mechanics and hemodynamic variables. RESULTS: The loss of end-expiratory lung volume and mean lung volume compared to baseline was lower during FCV compared to VCV (end-expiratory lung volume: FCV, \u2212 126 \u00b1 207 ml; VCV, \u2212 316 \u00b1 254 ml; p < 0.001, mean lung volume: FCV, \u2212 108.2 \u00b1 198.6 ml; VCV, \u2212 315.8 \u00b1 252.1 ml; p < 0.001) and at comparable plateau pressure (baseline, 19.6 \u00b1 3.7; VCV, 20.2 \u00b1 3.4; FCV, 20.2 \u00b1 3.8 cmH(2)O; p = 0.441), mean tracheal pressure was higher (baseline, 13.1 \u00b1 1.1; VCV, 12.9 \u00b1 1.2; FCV, 14.8 \u00b1 2.2 cmH(2)O; p < 0.001). All other respiratory and hemodynamic variables were comparable between the ventilation modes. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that, compared to VCV, FCV improves regional ventilation distribution of the lung at comparable PEEP, tidal volume, P(Plat) and ventilation frequency. The increase in end-expiratory lung volume during FCV was probably caused by the increased mean tracheal pressure which can be attributed to the linearized expiratory pressure decline.
