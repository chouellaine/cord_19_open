Thus, research about WhatsApp\u2019s influence in general and especially its influence in education was relevant and significant. While there was much research involving WhatsApp and learning, it was not conclusive about the effects of WhatsApp on student learning. Specifically, research focusing on collaborative learning using WhatsApp was lacking, including research instruments for measuring collaboration on WhatsApp. Consequently, the paper\u2019s research problem was the lack of research instruments for measuring collaboration on WhatsApp in relation to academic achievement. To address the research problem, the study followed the important initial and conceptual steps of the instrument development process to develop a research instrument to measure collaboration on WhatsApp in relation to academic achievement. The result of the paper was a developed instrument that provides researchers with a basis to measure the explanatory constructs involved in mobile collaborative learning (MCL) processes on WhatsApp and potentially other social media platforms. Therefore, the paper made an appropriately theoretical contribution, which was grounded in the scientific literature. The study facilitated positivistic research and epistemology for acquiring objective and precise scientific knowledge. Such deductive research promotes theory testing and development and presents educators and students with scientific evidence about learning with MCL applications such as WhatsApp from which both curriculum and learning design can be informed and benefited.

Since students have left a large amount of online learning data, it provides an effective way to predict students\u2019 academic performance and enable pre-intervention for at-risk students. Current data sources used to predict students\u2019 performance are limited to data just from the corresponding learning platform, from which only learning behaviors on that course can be observed. However, students\u2019 academic performance will be related to other behavioral factors, especially the patterns of using Internet. In this paper, we utilize two types of datasets from 505 university students, i.e., online learning records for a project-based course, and network logs of university campus network. A deep learning framework: Sequential Prediction based on Deep Network (SPDN) is proposed to predict students\u2019 performance in the course.

Nguyen and the profound impact he has made in advancing the state-of-the-art in modeling, simulating, and understanding the dynamics of uncertain systems. His seminal works on Random Fuzzy Sets have (a) significantly impacted our perceptions of seeking methods and approaches to acquire and assimilate data or information from uncertain sources, (b) enhanced our understanding to develop strategies for deep learning the interconnections, implications, and consequences, thereby allowing the processing of data to its logical conclusions and (c) has infinitely broadened the horizon towards conceiving machine-based decision-making architectures that optimize our perceived understanding to build systems that can mimic human decision-making capabilities. These three universal attributes fit the breadth and scope of Soft Computing. The paper focuses on three distinct topics wherein we explore human perceptions that merge the conscious attributes combining facts, myths, traditions, culture, beliefs, and a sense of reasoning towards a higher level of consciousness, and provides avenues for their adoption and physical realizations. The first topic discusses the possibilities of harvesting vast amounts of hydrokinetic energy from low-head flows in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. The Mekong River has a perceived power potential of between 50 and 70 Gigawatts (GW). The reality is only one-quarter of the perceived power is plausible for harvesting. We discuss the possibility of transforming existing concrete structures across the arteries and tributaries of the Mekong River in the Delta Region to mini-hydropower plants. One example shows the possibilities of harvesting up to 250 KW at an existing structure that can serve the energy needs of local businesses involved in aquaculture, local commerce, and residential needs. Since recognizing conventional hydropower is ecologically damaging, Vietnam has focused its energy policy solely on Solar and Wind, which are 3\u20134 times higher in cost than Water. Low-head energy, which is currently unused, could be perceived as a significant contributor to the renewable energy portfolio for Vietnam. The second topic discusses the possibility for Ayurvedic medicine, an ancient Indian practice of herbal medicine, as a complementary form of medication compared to modern medicine. The Tulsi plant is recognized for its life-saving properties that make Hindus believe it is a Holy plant. Scientific observations have shown the plant can produce substantial amounts of pure Oxygen by absorbing carbon dioxide from the ambient. Research has also shown that Tulsi can absorb fluorides from water. The discussions highlight the adoption of Ayurvedic medicine based on historical and traditional beliefs that Nature grown ingredients can induce natural body responses that aid in recovery from illnesses. Ayurvedic medicine exploits the power of the mind based on beliefs and traditions as a means for healing from illnesses. Finally, the third topic is a search for the meaning to the phrase \u201cPointing the finger at the Moon,\u201d and leading to the discovery of a three-dimensional holographic image on the Moon. The discovery sheds light on a long-standing question of what The Buddha was pointing to on the Moon. Historical background based on art is combined with basic Moon facts and a sense of geometry to uncover a three-dimensional holographic image that symbolizes Gautama Buddha\u2019s path to enlightenment. The form is identified as Abhaya Mudra, the Fearless Form. Among the many forms displayed in Buddhist sculptures of the meditation posture, the Abhaya Mudra is significant as it is a gesture for tolerance, fearlessness, and compassion. In Buddhist philosophy, the attributes of intolerance, fearfulness, and hatred are erased from the human mind through detachment.","publish_time":1592524800000,"author_summary":" Prasad, Nadipuram R.","abstract_summary":" The paper highlights a lifetime experience of<br>knowledge gained through interactions with Professor<br>Hung T.

Nevertheless, the use of scripts may cause motivational problems over time. To deal with this issue, we propose the gamification of scripted CL sessions through an ontology that encodes knowledge from game design practices and theories of motivation and human behavior. This knowledge may be used by intelligent theory-aware systems to avoid the one-size-fits-all approach, providing support for the personalization of gamification. In this paper, we reported the results obtained in an empirical study to validate our ontology-based gamification of scripted CL sessions.

Collaborative game-based learning environments that can detect this off-task behavior in real-time have the potential to enhance collaboration between students by redirecting the conversation back to more productive topics. This paper investigates the use of dialogue analysis to classify student conversational utterances as either off-task or on-task. Using classroom data collected from 13 groups of four students, we trained off-task dialogue models for text messages from a group chat feature integrated into Crystal Island: EcoJourneys, a collaborative game-based learning environment for middle school ecosystem science. We evaluate the effectiveness of the off-task dialogue models, which use different word embeddings (i.e., word2vec, ELMo, and BERT), as well as predictive off-task dialogue models that capture varying amounts of contextual information from the chat log. Results indicate that predictive off-task dialogue models that incorporate a window of recent context and represent the sequential nature of the chat messages achieve higher predictive performance compared to models that do not leverage this information.

However, it has been shown that such neglect can be suppressed by using teachable agents (TA\u2019s).

On the basis of teacher assessments of the students\u2019 general skills, data logs and analyses of sequential patterns, we concluded that the willingness to accept CCF differs between students, but also between conditions and situations. One major finding is that a TA supports the students to more readily embrace CCF, even if the effect is larger for lower-achieving students. Another finding is that indications of being far from succeeding, such as low success rates or repeated trials and revisions, have a negative impact on feedback acceptance, even if a TA mitigates some of this influence.

Currently, most systems adapt by assigning different game elements based on a single learner profile (e.g. dominant player type, personality or gender). However, there is no study yet that analyse the effect of combining several profiles. In this paper, we study the usage data from 258 students who used a gamified learning environment as a part of their mathematics class. By simulating different adaptation techniques, we show that the learner model chosen to tailor gamification has significant effects on learners\u2019 motivation and engaged behaviours depending on the profile(s) used in this context. We also show that tailoring to initial motivation to learn mathematics can improve intrinsic motivation. Finally, we show that tailoring to both player type and motivation profiles can improve intrinsic motivation, and decrease amotivation, compared to a single adaptation only based on learner motivation. We discuss the implications of our findings regarding the choice of a learner model for tailoring gamification in educational environments.","publish_time":1591660800000,"author_summary":" Hallifax, Stuart; Lavou\u00e9, Elise; Serna,<br>Audrey","abstract_summary":" Gamification, defined as the use of game<br>elements in non game situations, is a widely used method<br>to foster learner engagement and motivation.

It aids individuals in reducing uncertainty about the knowledge of the environment and helps them in acquiring an adaptive behaviour at a lower cost than by learning it by themselves. Among the copying strategies, conformity, which is the copying of behavioural decisions presented by the majority, has been well studied and reported in many animals, including humans. The previous study showed that dogs did not conform to their multiple conspecific individuals; however, dogs have evolved to increase their adaptability while living with humans, and it is plausible that dogs have selected appropriate behaviour according to the behaviour of humans.

It is also designed to teach students how to best communicate their findings and conclusions. This course is built on two team-based projects. Students practiced and timed the assembly of a state-of-the-art drone, the DJI Spark, and created a mid-term project presentation and report of their plan to setup an assembly plant in Michigan for this drone. Students learned the assembly line design, cycle time balancing, time study, automation, robotics, ergonomics, process capability index, and plant layout. The final project is the design and manufacture of an attachment to a hobby drone, DJI F330, for a mission that will benefit society. Students learned the social-aspects of manufacturing, computer-aided design, additive manufacturing, fabrication skills, and manufacturing processes. Each team identified a societal need, designed an attachment to the DJI F330 drone, reviewed the design with experienced engineers, manufactured components, assembled the attachment, and evaluated them in drone test flights. This course was implemented in close collaboration with a local community college to share the lecture and lab materials as well as pedagogy in manufacturing to benefit the same cohort of high school graduates. This approach of integrated social science, manufacturing, and technical communication to teach manufacturing using drones and connect manufacturing and society were demonstrated to be effective for an introductory freshman engineering course.

This is done by: 1) using an OER quality prediction model based on metadata, OER properties, and content; 2) supporting learners to set individual skill targets based on actual labour market information, and 3) building a personalized OER recommender to help learners to master their skill targets. Accordingly, we built a prototype focusing on Data Science related jobs, and evaluated this prototype with 23 data scientists in different expertise levels. Pilot participants used our prototype for at least 30 minutes and commented on each of the recommended OERs. As a result, more than 400 recommendations were generated and 80.9% of the recommendations were reported as useful.","publish_time":1590796800000,"author_summary":" Tavakoli, Mohammadreza; Faraji, Ali; Mol,<br>Stefan T.; Kismih'ok, G'abor","abstract_summary":" This Work in Progress Research paper departs<br>from the recent, turbulent changes in global<br>societies, forcing many citizens to re-skill themselves<br>to (re)gain employment.

An obvious solution to such demand is automation. The automation of the means of production occurred in several stages, as in the industrial revolutions, previously we can say that it was our physical capacities that were surpassed. However, in the middle of the 4th Industrial Revolution, with the massive use of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) is our cognitive capacitie that is being continuously surpassed. Thus, new questions about the benefits and risks of the use of such technologies are being debated, mainly in the area of machine ethics, which will be the focus of our study.

Numeracy encompasses the ways in which people cope with the mathematical, quantitative, and statistical demands of adult life, and is viewed as an important outcome of schooling and as a foundational skill for all adults. The focus on vulnerability stems from the realization that concerns of policy makers and educators alike often center on populations seen as vulnerable. The paper is organized in five sections. After a brief introduction, Section 2 examines adult numeracy, focusing on five numeracy domains (health, financial, digital, civic, and workplace numeracy), literacy\u2013numeracy linkages, functional and critical aspects of numeracy, and the centrality of numeracy practices, and notes sources of vulnerability for each of these. Section 3 sketches formal, non-formal and informal contexts in which adults learn or develop their numeracy, and examines factors that may be potential sources of vulnerability, including systemic factors and dispositional and affect factors. Section 4 reflects more broadly on the concept of vulnerability, introduces selected aspects of the papers published in this issue of ZDM Mathematics Education, and points to findings regarding adult learners who may be deemed vulnerable.

We announced a knowledge-test entailing prizes in the classrooms of a primary school and a middle school. Altogether 79 Chinese children (6\u201318 years) voluntarily participated in the test: listening to a series of animal sounds before guessing the names of the animals. Meanwhile, behind the participants, a video was playing images that ostensibly corresponded to the sounds being played. In fact, this was not necessarily the case, i.e., some items cannot be solved because the sounds played are not from any animal but machine-synthesized. Participants were instructed not to look back at the video. However, 51 children peeked at the video for the unsolvable items, although the peeking behavior decreased with age. Moreover, when explaining how they correctly guessed the unsolvable items, children as young as 6 years old were able to apply a linguistic strategy (i.e., \u201ccapability attribution\u201d) for lying. Besides \u201ccapability attribution,\u201d Children also applied \u201cfortune attribution\u201d and \u201ctopic shift\u201d for lying.

This paper contributes to the closing of this gap by exploring and empirically testing the effects of interactive analytical dashboard features on situation awareness (SA) and task performance in operational DSS. Using the theoretical lens of SA, we develop hypotheses about the effects of a what-if analysis as an interactive analytical dashboard feature on operational decision-makers' SA and task performance. The resulting research model is studied with a laboratory experiment, including eye-tracking data of 83 participants. Our findings show that although a what-if analysis leads to higher task performance, it may also reduce SA, nourishing a potential out-of-the-loop problem. Thus, designers and users of interactive analytical dashboards have to carefully mitigate these effects in the implementation and application of operational DSS. In this article, we translate our findings into implications for designing dashboards within operational DSS to help practitioners in their efforts to address the danger of the out-of-the-loop syndrome.","publish_time":1589846400000,"author_summary":" Nadj, Mario; Maedche, Alexander; Schieder,<br>Christian","abstract_summary":" In recent years, new types of interactive<br>analytical dashboard features have emerged for<br>operational decision support systems (DSS).

The proper self-regulation of emotions allows to tolerate frustrations, improves social skills and healthy bonds with peers and adults in the environment (Bisquerra, 2003, p. 12). The lack of regulation causes discomfort that leads to a decrease in academic performance (Graziano, Reavis, Keanes & Calkins, 2006) and particularly in reading comprehension, because this competence requires motivation and cognitive processes that will allow to process the linguistic code, interpret it and represent it symbolically (Alonso-Tapia, 2005, p. 64). In this work, we show the essential relationship between emotional regulation and reading comprehension in primary school students. After that, we study the effect of lockdown on these two processes. The aim is to have preliminary information about the challenges and effects of the current situation. To do this, a semi-structured survey has been conducted of parents and teachers in order to assess the psychological and educational effects of the current health situation. The results of 40 semi-structured telephone surveys are analyzed, 20 of parents of children with learning disorders and 20 of their classroom teachers in Traslasierra, C\u00f3rdoba-Argentina. The results inform that the students and their parents have difficulties to regulate their emotions and this emotional struggle has a negative impact on comprehension of texts. The problems that previously presented in these two areas have increased due to the lack of adaptation of activities by teachers, the lack of knowledge of their parents to help them and the difficulty in accessing digital technologies. Both parents and teachers express that lockdown affects learning processes, although parents are also concerned about the effects on social life.","publish_time":1609372800000,"author_summary":" Sevilla Vallejo, Santiago; Ceballos Mar\u00f3n,<br>Natalia Andrea","abstract_summary":" Abstract Emotions are complex states, which<br>have a fundamental role for children\u2019s mental<br>health and learning.
