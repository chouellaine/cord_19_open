After showing some evidence of human and non-human primate PV recombination, we report a comprehensive recombination analysis of all currently known 82 Alphapapillomaviruses (Alpha-PVs). We carried out an exploratory study and found novel recombination events between High-Risk HPV Types and Macaca fascicularis PV1 (MfPV1), Macaca Fuscata PV2 (MfuPV2) and Pan Paniscus PV1 (PpPV1) Papillomaviruses. This is the first evidence of interactions between PVs from different hosts and hence postulates the likelihood of ancient host switching among Alpha-PVs. Notwithstanding these results should be interpreted with caution because the major and minor parents indicated by RDP4 program are simply the sequences in the alignment that most closely resemble the actual parents. We found statistically significant differences between the phylogenies of the PV sequences with recombination regions and PV sequences without recombination regions using the Shimodaira\u2013Hasegawa phylogenetic incongruence testing. We show that not more than 76MYA Alpha-PVs were in the same biological niche, a pre-requisite for recombination, and as the hosts evolved and diversified, the viruses adapted to specific host niches which eventually led to coevolution with specific hosts before speciation of primate species. Thus providing evidence that in ancient times no earlier than the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic age, Alpha-PVs recombined and switched hosts, but whether this host switching is occurring currently is unknown. However, a clearer picture of the PVs evolutionary landscape can only be achieved with the incremental discovery of PV sequences, especially from the animal kingdom.

It then simulates transmission of the disease over time, spreading from specific infection sources, using contact rates of individuals within different social contexts. We report that the prospective sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 clarified the probable source of infection in cases where epidemiological links could not be determined, significantly decreased the proportion of COVID-19 cases with contentious links, documented genomically similar cases associated with concurrent transmission in several institutions and identified previously unsuspected links.

To compare the SARS-CoV-2 genome to the human genome, we used the blast-like alignment tool (BLAT) of the University of California, Santa Cruz Genome Browser. BLAT can align a user sequence of 25 bases or more to the genome. BLAT search results revealed a 117-base pair SARS-CoV-2 sequence in the human genome with 94.6% identity. The sequence was in chromosome 1p within an intronic region of the netrin G1 (NTNG1) gene. The sequence matched a sequence in the SARS-CoV-2 orf1b (open reading frames) gene. The SARS-CoV-2 human sequence lies within non-structural proteins 14 and 15 (NSP14 and NSP15), and is quite close to the viral spike sequence, separated only by NSP16, a 904-base pair sequence. The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the binding of the virus spike protein to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and internalization of the complex by the host cell. It is probably no accident that a sequence from the SARS-CoV-2 orf1b gene is found in the human NTNG1 gene, implicated in schizophrenia, and that haloperidol, used to treat schizophrenia, may also be a treatment for COVID-19. We suggest, therefore, that it is important to investigate other haloperidol analogs. Among them are benperidol, bromperidol, bromperidol decanoate, droperidol, seperidol hydrochloride, and trifluperidol.

In this work, we present the full genome sequence for 17 SARS-CoV-2 isolates corresponding to the earliest sampled cases in Mexico. Global and local phylogenomics, coupled with mutational analysis, consistently revealed that these viral sequences are distributed within 2 known lineages, the SARS-CoV-2 lineage A\/G, containing mostly sequences from North America, and the lineage B\/S containing mainly sequences from Europe. Based on the exposure history of the cases and on the phylogenomic analysis, we characterized fourteen independent introduction events. Additionally, three cases with no travel history were identified. We found evidence that two of these cases represent local transmission cases occurring in Mexico during mid-March 2020, denoting the earliest events described for the country. Within this local transmission cluster, we also identified the H49Y amino acid change in the Spike protein. This mutation is a homoplasy occurring independently through time and space, and may function as a molecular marker to follow on any further spread of these viral variants throughout the country.

Methods Publicly available data on type definitions based on whole-genome sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 sampled during December and March 2020 from 3636 infected patients spread over 55 countries were collected. Phylodynamic analyses were performed and the temporal and spatial evolution of the virus was examined. Results It was found that (i) temporal variation in frequencies of types of the coronavirus was significant; ancestral viruses of type O were replaced by evolved viruses belonging to type A2a; (ii) spatial variation was not significant; with the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the dominant virus was the A2a type virus in every geographical region; (iii) within a geographical region, there was significant micro-level variation in the frequencies of the different viral types, and (iv) the evolved coronavirus of type A2a swept rapidly across all continents.

The association of the virus spread from the market is supported by the close relation of genome sequences of environmental surface samples with virus samples from earliest patients by phylogenetic analysis. Objectives To have an insight into the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences reported from India for better understanding on their epidemiology and virulence. Methods Genome sequences of Indian isolates of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed to understand their phylogeny and divergence with respect to other isolates reported from other countries. Amino acid sequences of individual open reading frames (ORFs) from SARS-CoV-2 Indian isolates were aligned with sequences of isolates reported from other countries to identify the mutations occurred in Indian isolates. Results Our analysis suggests that Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates are closely related to isolates reported from other parts of the world. Most ORFs are highly conserved; mutations were also detected in some ORFs. We found that most isolates reported from India have key mutations at 614th position of the S protein and 84th position of the ORF 8, which has been reported to be associated with high virulence and high transmission rate. Conclusion An attempt was made to understand the SARS-CoV-2 virus reported from India. SARS-CoV-2 reported from India was closely similar to other SARS-CoV-2 reported from other parts of the world, which suggests that vaccines and other therapeutic methods generated from other countries might work well in India. In addition, available sequence data suggest that majority of Indian isolates are capable of high transmission and virulence.","publish_time":1590969600000,"author_summary":" Devendran, Ragunathan; Kumar, Manish;<br>Chakraborty, Supriya","abstract_summary":" Background The origin of severe acute<br>respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still<br>a debatable topic.

We also evaluated the CpG dinucleotide contents in SARS-CoV-2 and other human and animal coronavirus genomes. Out of 1136 single nucleotide variations (~4% divergence) between human SARS-CoV-2 and bat RaTG13, 682 (60%) can be attributed to C>U and U>C substitutions, far exceeding other types of substitutions. An accumulation of C>U mutations was also observed in SARS-CoV2 variants that arose within the human population. Globally, the C>U substitutions increased the frequency of codons for hydrophobic amino acids in SARS-CoV-2 peptides, while U>C substitutions decreased it. In contrast to most other coronaviruses, both SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 exhibited CpG depletion in their genomes. The data suggest that C-to-U conversion mediated by C deamination played a significant role in the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. We hypothesize that the high frequency C>U transitions reflect virus adaptation processes in their hosts, and that SARS-CoV-2 could have been evolving for a relatively long period in humans following the transfer from animals before spreading worldwide.","publish_time":1594080000000,"author_summary":" Maty\u00e1\u0161ek, Roman; Kova\u0159\u00edk, Ale\u0161","abstract_summary":" The pandemic caused by the spread of SARS-CoV-2<br>has led to considerable interest in its<br>evolutionary origin and genome structure.

Notable features make SARS-CoV-2 distinct from most other previously-identified Betacoronaviruses, including the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 and a unique insertion of twelve nucleotide or four amino acids (PRRA) at the S1\/S2 boundary. In this study, we identified two deletion variants of SARS-CoV-2 that either directly affect the polybasic cleavage site itself (NSPRRAR) or a flanking sequence (QTQTN). These deletions were verified by multiple sequencing methods. In vitro results showed that the deletion of NSPRRAR likely does not affect virus replication in Vero and Vero-E6 cells, however the deletion of QTQTN may restrict late phase viral replication. The deletion of QTQTN was detected in 3 of 68 clinical samples and half of 24 in vitro isolated viruses, whilst the deletion of NSPRRAR was identified in 3 in vitro isolated viruses. Our data indicate that (i) there may be distinct selection pressures on SARS-CoV-2 replication or infection in vitro and in vivo, (ii) an efficient mechanism for deleting this region from the viral genome may exist, given that the deletion variant is commonly detected after two rounds of cell passage, and (iii) the PRRA insertion, which is unique to SARS-CoV-2, is not fixed during virus replication in vitro These findings provide information to aid further investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and a better understanding of the NSPRRAR deletion variant observed here.Important notes The spike protein determines the infectivity and host range of coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 has two unique features in its spike protein, the receptor binding domain and an insertion of twelve nucleotides at the S1\/S2 boundary resulting a furin-like cleavage site.

This motif directs cleavage of the S glycoprotein into functional subunits during virus entry or exit. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein can be a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus transmission and affect viral pathogenicity. Allied to this transcriptome analysis, tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify over 500 viral peptides and 44 phosphopeptides, covering almost all of the proteins predicted to be encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including peptides unique to the deleted variant of the S glycoprotein. Detection of an apparently viable deletion in the furin cleavage site of the S glycoprotein reinforces the point that this and other regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins may readily mutate. This is of clear significance given the interest in the S glycoprotein as a potential vaccine target and the observation that the furin cleavage site likely contributes strongly to the pathogenesis and zoonosis of this virus.

We analyzed NGS data derived from clinical samples of three Chinese patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, in order to identify small- and large-scale intra-host variations in the viral genome. We identified tens of low- or higher-frequency single nucleotide variations (SNVs) with variable density across the viral genome, affecting 7 out of 10 protein-coding viral genes. The majority of these SNVs corresponded to missense changes. The annotation of the identified SNVs but also of all currently circulating strain variations revealed colocalization of intra-host but also strain specific SNVs with primers and probes currently used in molecular diagnostics assays. Moreover, we de-novo assembled the viral genome, in order to isolate and validate intra-host structural variations and recombination breakpoints. The bioinformatics analysis disclosed genomic rearrangements over poly-A \/ poly-U regions located in ORF1ab and spike (S) gene, including a potential recombination hot-spot within S gene. Our results highlight the intra-host genomic diversity and plasticity of SARS-CoV-2, pointing out genomic regions that are prone to alterations. The isolated SNVs and genomic rearrangements, reflect the intra-patient capacity of the polymorphic quasispecies, which may arise rapidly during the outbreak, allowing immunological escape of the virus, offering resistance to anti-viral drugs and affecting the sensitivity of the molecular diagnostics assays.","publish_time":1585353600000,"author_summary":" Karamitros, Timokratis; Papadopoulou,<br>Gethsimani; Bousali, Maria; Mexias, Anastasios;<br>Tsiodras, Sotiris; Mentis, Andreas","abstract_summary":" In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical<br>pneumonia (Coronavirus disease 2019 - COVID-19)<br>associated with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was<br>reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.

In this work, we aim to find out the origin, evolutionary patternthat led to its pathogenicity and possible transmission pathway of 2019-nCoV. To achieve the aims we conducted a large-scale deep phylogenetic analysis on the 162 complete Orthocoronavirinae genomes consisting of four genera namely Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus, their gene trees analysis and subsequently genome and gene recombination analyses. Our analyses revealed that i) bat, pangolin and anteater are the natural hosts of 2019-nCoV, ii) outbreak of 2019-nCoV took place via inter-intra species transmission mode, iii) host-specific adaptive mutation made 2019-nCoV more virulent, and the presence of widespread recombination events led to the evolution of new 2019-nCoV strain and\/or could be determinant of its pathogenicity. Highlights Orthocoronavirinae genome phylogeny revealed that bat, pangolin and anteater are natural reservoir hosts of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV\/SARS-CoV-2). Host-specific adaptive mutation occurred among the coronaviruses. Transmission of 2019-nCoV to human took place by inter-intra species mode of transmission.

Here, we address these questions and find that the sarbecoviruses \u2013 the viral subgenus responsible for the emergence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 \u2013 exhibit frequent recombination, but the SARS-CoV-2 lineage itself is not a recombinant of any viruses detected to date. In order to employ phylogenetic methods to date the divergence events between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir, recombinant regions of a 68-genome sarbecovirus alignment were removed with three independent methods. Bayesian evolutionary rate and divergence date estimates were consistent for all three recombination-free alignments and robust to two different prior specifications based on HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV evolutionary rates. Divergence dates between SARS-CoV-2 and the bat sarbecovirus reservoir were estimated as 1948 (95% HPD: 1879-1999), 1969 (95% HPD: 1930-2000), and 1982 (95% HPD: 1948-2009). Despite intensified characterization of sarbecoviruses since SARS, the lineage giving rise to SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating unnoticed for decades in bats and been transmitted to other hosts such as pangolins. The occurrence of a third significant coronavirus emergence in 17 years together with the high prevalence and virus diversity in bats implies that these viruses are likely to cross species boundaries again. In Brief The Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the sarbecovirus subgenus which shows frequent recombination in its evolutionary history. We characterize the extent of this genetic exchange and identify non-recombining regions of the sarbecovirus genome using three independent methods to remove the effects of recombination. Using these non-recombining genome regions and prior information on coronavirus evolutionary rates, we obtain estimates from three approaches that the most likely divergence date of SARS-CoV-2 from its most closely related available bat sequences ranges from 1948 to 1982. Key Points RaTG13 is the closest available bat virus to SARS-CoV-2; a sub-lineage of these bat viruses is able to infect humans. Two sister lineages of the RaTG13\/SARS-CoV-2 lineage infect Malayan pangolins. The sarbecoviruses show a pattern of deep recombination events, indicating that there are high levels of co-infection in horseshoe bats and that the viral pool can generate novel allele combinations and substantial genetic diversity; the sarbecoviruses are efficient \u2018explorers\u2019 of phenotype space. The SARS-CoV-2 lineage is not a recent recombinant, at least not involving any of the bat or pangolin viruses sampled to date. Non-recombinant regions of the sarbecoviruses can be identified, allowing for phylogenetic inference and dating to be performed. We constructed three such regions using different methods. We estimate that RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 diverged 40 to 70 years ago. There is a diverse unsampled reservoir of generalist viruses established in horseshoe bats. While an intermediate host responsible for the zoonotic event cannot be ruled out, the relevant evolution for spillover to humans very likely occurred in horseshoe bats.","publish_time":1585612800000,"author_summary":" Boni, Maciej F; Lemey, Philippe; Jiang,<br>Xiaowei; Lam, Tommy Tsan-Yuk; Perry, Blair; Castoe,<br>Todd; Rambaut, Andrew; Robertson, David L","abstract_summary":" There are outstanding evolutionary questions<br>on the recent emergence of coronavirus<br>SARS-CoV-2\/hCoV-19 in Hubei province that caused the COVID-19<br>pandemic, including (1) the relationship of the new virus<br>to the SARS-related coronaviruses, (2) the role<br>of bats as a reservoir species, (3) the potential<br>role of other mammals in the emergence event, and (4)<br>the role of recombination in viral emergence.<br>Here, we address these questions and find that the<br>sarbecoviruses \u2013 the viral subgenus responsible for the<br>emergence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 \u2013 exhibit frequent<br>recombination, but the SARS-CoV-2 lineage itself is not a<br>recombinant of any viruses detected...","title_summary":" Evolutionary origins of the SARS-CoV-2<br>sarbecovirus lineage responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic","x":34.277217865,"y":19.7819957733,"cluster":56,"cluster_name":"c57","cluster_description":"Sars-Cov-2 Genomes","tsne_x":34.277217865,"tsne_y":19.7819957733,"subcluster":13,"subcluster_description":"Sars-Cov-2 D614G Spike Protein","shape":"p"},{"cord_uid":"th0kjd6g","source_x":"BioRxiv","title":"A putative new SARS-CoV protein, 3a*, encoded in an ORF overlapping ORF3a","doi":"10.1101\/2020.05.12.088088","abstract":"Identification of the full complement of genes in SARS-CoV-2 is a crucial step towards gaining a fuller understanding of its molecular biology.

Furthermore, we show that the observed pattern of ACE2 usage among sarbecoviruses is most likely due to recombination. We show that the lineage that includes SARS-CoV-2 is most likely the ancestral ACE2-using lineage, and that recombination with at least one virus from this group conferred ACE2 usage to the progenitor of SARS-CoV-1 at some time in the past. We argue that alternative scenarios such as convergent evolution are much less parsimonious; we show that biogeography and patterns of host tropism support the plausibility of a recombination scenario; and we propose a competitive release hypothesis to explain how this recombination event could have occurred and why it is evolutionarily advantageous. The findings provide important insights into the natural history of ACE2 usage for both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, and a greater understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that shape zoonotic potential of coronaviruses.

In addition, four separate genomes are each shared by multiple patients, suggesting a common origin or community spread even during this early stage of infection. These results demonstrate how molecular epidemiology and evolutionary phylogenetics can help local health units track origins and vectors of spread for emerging diseases like SARS-CoV-2. Earlier detection and screening in this way could improve the effectiveness of regional public health interventions to prevent future pandemics.","publish_time":1593043200000,"author_summary":" Sjaarda, Calvin P; Rustom, Nazneen; Huang,<br>David; Perez-Patrigeon, Santiago; Hudson, Melissa<br>L; Wong, Henry; Guan, T Hugh; Ayub, Muhammad;<br>Soares, Claudio N; Colautti, Robert I; Evans, Gerald A;<br>Sheth, Prameet M","abstract_summary":" The emergence and global spread of SARS-CoV-2<br>has had profound social and economic consequences<br>and has shed light on the importance of continued<br>and additional investment in global health and<br>infectious disease surveillance.

In order to understand its pathogenicity, antigenic potential and to develop diagnostic and therapeutic tools, it is essential to portray the full repertoire of its expressed proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 coding capacity map is currently based on computational predictions and relies on homology to other coronaviruses. Since coronaviruses differ in their protein array, especially in the variety of accessory proteins, it is crucial to characterize the specific collection of SARS-CoV-2 translated open reading frames (ORF)s in an unbiased and open-ended manner. Utilizing a suit of ribosome profiling techniques, we present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 coding regions, allowing us to accurately quantify the expression of canonical viral ORFs and to identify 23 novel unannotated viral ORFs. These ORFs include several in-frame internal ORFs lying within existing ORFs, resulting in N-terminally truncated products, as well as internal out-of-frame ORFs, which generate novel polypeptides. Finally, we detected a prominent initiation at a CUG codon located in the 5\u2019UTR. Although this codon is shared by all SARS-CoV-2 transcripts, the initiation was specific to the genomic RNA, indicating that the genomic RNA harbors unique features that may affect ribosome engagement.

Methods We perform a phylogenetic analysis of 742 publicly available Danish SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and put them into context using sequences from other countries. Result Our findings are consistent with several introductions of the virus to Denmark from independent sources. We identify several chains of mutations that occurred in Denmark and in at least one case find evidence that the virus spread from Denmark to other countries. A number of the mutations found in Denmark are non-synonymous, and in general there is a considerable variety of strains. The proportions of the most common haplotypes is stable after lockdown. Conclusion Our work shows how genetic data can be used to identify routes of introduction of a virus into a region and provide alternative means for verifying existing assumptions. For example, our analysis supports the hypothesis that the virus was brought to Denmark by skiers returning from Ischgl. On the other hand, we identify transmission chains suggesting that Denmark was part of a network of countries among which the virus was being transmitted; thus challenging the common narrative that Denmark only got infected from abroad. Our analysis does not indicate that the major haplotypes appearing in Denmark have a different degree of virality.

Our observations suggest that by the time SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in late 2019, it was already pre-adapted to human transmission to an extent similar to late epidemic SARS-CoV. However, no precursors or branches of evolution stemming from a less human-adapted SARS-CoV-2-like virus have been detected. The sudden appearance of a highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 presents a major cause for concern that should motivate stronger international efforts to identify the source and prevent near future re-emergence. Any existing pools of SARS-CoV-2 progenitors would be particularly dangerous if similarly well adapted for human transmission. To look for clues regarding intermediate hosts, we analyze recent key findings relating to how SARS-CoV-2 could have evolved and adapted for human transmission, and examine the environmental samples from the Wuhan Huanan seafood market.

To date, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected more than 8 million people worldwide and killed over 5% of them. Efforts are being made all over the world to control the spread of the disease and most importantly to develop a vaccine. Understanding the genetic evolution of the virus, its geographic characteristics and stability is particularly important for developing a universal vaccine covering all circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 and for predicting its efficacy. In this perspective, we analyzed the sequences of 30,983 complete genomes from 80 countries located in six geographical zones (Africa, Asia, Europe, North & South America, and Oceania) isolated from December 24, 2019 to May 13, 2020, and compared them to the reference genome. Our in-depth analysis revealed the presence of 3,206 variant sites compared to the reference Wuhan-Hu-1 genome, with a distribution that is largely uniform over all continents. Remarkably, a low frequency of recurrent mutations was observed; only 182 mutations (5.67%) had a prevalence greater than 1%. Nevertheless, fourteen hotspot mutations (> 10%) were identified at different locations, seven at the ORF1ab gene (in regions coding for nsp2, nsp3, nsp6, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14 and nsp15), three in the nucleocapsid protein, one in the spike protein, one in orf3a, and one in orf8. Moreover, 35 non-synonymous mutations were identified in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein with a low prevalence (<1%) across all genomes, of which only four could potentially enhance the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the human receptor ACE2. These results along with the phylogenetic analysis demonstrate that the virus does not have a significant divergence at the protein level compared to the reference both among and within different geographical areas. Unlike the influenza virus or HIV viruses, the slow rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 makes the potential of developing an effective global vaccine very likely.","publish_time":1592697600000,"author_summary":" Alouane, Tarek; Laamarti, Meriem; Essabbar,<br>Abdelomunim; Hakmi, Mohammed; Bouricha, El Mehdi;<br>Chemao-Elfihri, M.W.; Kartti, Souad; Boumajdi, Nasma;<br>Bendani, Houda; Laamrti, Rokaia; Ghrifi, Fatima;<br>Allam, Loubna; Aanniz, Tarik; Ouadghiri, Mouna; El<br>Hafidi, Naima; El Jaoudi, Rachid; Benrahma, Houda;<br>Elattar, Jalil; Mentag, Rachid; Sbabou, Laila;<br>Nejjari, Chakib; Amzazi, Saaid; Belyamani, Lahcen;<br>Ibrahimi, Azeddine","abstract_summary":" The Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)<br>pandemic has been ongoing since its onset in late<br>November 2019 in Wuhan, China.

The viruses were subsequently disseminated to different parts of China and other countries, with diverse mutational profiles being recorded in strains recovered subsequently. Interestingly, four genetic clusters defined as Super-transmitters (STs) were found to become dominant and were responsible for the major outbreaks in various countries. Among the four clusters, ST1 is widely disseminated in Asia and the US and mainly responsible for outbreaks in the states of Washington and California in the US as well as those in South Korea at the end of February and early March, whereas ST4 contributed to the pandemic in Europe. Each ST cluster carried a signature mutation profile which allowed us to trace the origin and transmission patterns of specific viruses in different parts of the world.

Artificial modification of CpG frequency is a valid approach for live attenuated vaccine development, and if this is to be applied to SARS-CoV-2, we must first understand the role CpG motifs play in regulating SARS-CoV-2 replication. Accordingly, the CpG composition of the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 genome was characterised in the context of other coronaviruses. CpG suppression amongst coronaviruses does not significantly differ according to genera of virus, but does vary according to host species and primary replication site (a proxy for tissue tropism), supporting the hypothesis that viral CpG content may influence cross-species transmission. Although SARS-CoV-2 exhibits overall strong CpG suppression, this varies considerably across the genome, and the Envelope (E) open reading frame (ORF) and ORF10 demonstrate an absence of CpG suppression. While ORF10 is only present in the genomes of a subset of coronaviruses, E is essential for virus replication. Across the Coronaviridae, E genes display remarkably high variation in CpG composition, with those of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 having much higher CpG content than other coronaviruses isolated from humans. Phylogeny indicates that this is an ancestrally-derived trait reflecting their origin in bats, rather than something selected for after zoonotic transfer. Conservation of CpG motifs in these regions suggests that they have a functionality which over-rides the need to suppress CpG; an observation relevant to future strategies towards a rationally attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.","publish_time":1588896000000,"author_summary":" Digard, Paul; Lee, Hui Min; Sharp, Colin; Grey,<br>Finn; Gaunt, Eleanor","abstract_summary":" CpG dinucleotides are under-represented in<br>the genomes of single stranded RNA viruses, and<br>coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, are no exception to<br>this.

Samples collected at Cedars Sinai Medical Center were collected from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified and diagnosed 192 patients by our in-house qPCR assay. In this population, the highest frequency variants were in known mutations in the 5'UTR, AA193 protein, RdRp and the spike glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 transmission within the local community was tracked by integrating mutation data with patient postal codes with two predominant community spread clusters being identified. Notably, significant viral genomic diversity was identified. Less than 10 percent of the Los Angeles community samples resembled published mutational profiles of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from China, while >50 percent of the isolates shared closely similarities to those from New York State. Based on these findings we conclude SARS-CoV-2 was likely introduced into the Los Angeles community predominantly from New York State but also via multiple other independent transmission routes including but not limited to Washington State and China.","publish_time":1592006400000,"author_summary":" Zhang, W.; Govindavari, J.

We find strong evidence for variant open reading frames (ORFs) encoded by SARS-CoV-2 RNA. A variant transcript for the matrix protein (M) lacking its N-terminal transmembrane domain, initiated by a TTG start codon, is produced by a strong transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS)-mediated junction within the M ORF and represents up to 19% of all M ORFs. Sporadic non-canonical junctions in the spike (S) ORF lead to N-terminal truncations that remove the N-terminal and receptor-binding domains from up to 25% of S ORFs.

These ORFs contain the first 200-800 amino acids of ORF1a and may represent a mechanism to regulate the relative abundance of ORF1a nonstructural proteins.

We report the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela, and present a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic landscape in the Colombian-Venezuelan border region. We sequenced and assembled viral genomes from total RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal (NP) clinical specimens using a custom reference-based analysis pipeline. Three assemblies obtained were subjected to typing using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages Pangolin tool. A total of 376 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from South America were obtained from the GISAID database to perform comparative genomic analyses. Additionally, the Wuhan-1 strain was used as reference. We found that two of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela belonged to the B1 lineage, and the third to the B.1.13 lineage. We observed a point mutation in the Spike protein gene (D614G substitution), previously reported to be associated with increased infectivity, in all three Venezuelan genomes.

The distribution of the four gene alleles is determined:16 for E, 40 for M, 131 for N and 173 for S genes. Phylogenetic analysis shows that global SARS-CoV-2 isolates can be clustered into three to four major clades based on the protein sequences of these genes. Intragenic recombination event isn\u2019t detected among different alleles. However, purifying selection has conducted on the evolution of these genes. By analyzing full genomic sequences of these alleles using codon-substitution models (M8, M3 and M2a) and likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) of codeML package, it reveals that codon 614 of S glycoprotein has subjected to strong positive selection pressure and a persistent D614G mutation is identified. The definitive positive selection of D614G mutation is further confirmed by internal fixed effects likelihood (IFEL) and Evolutionary Fingerprinting methods implemented in Hyphy package. In addition, another potential positive selection site at codon 5 in the signal sequence of the S protein is also identified. The allele containing D614G mutation has undergone significant expansion during SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic, implying a better adaptability of isolates with the mutation. However, L5F allele expansion is relatively restricted. The D614G mutation is located at the subdomain 2 (SD2) of C-terminal portion (CTP) of the S1 subunit. Protein structural modeling shows that the D614G mutation may cause the disruption of salt bridge among S protein monomers increase their flexibility, and in turn promote receptor binding domain (RBD) opening, virus attachment and entry into host cells. Located at the signal sequence of S protein as it is, L5F mutation may facilitate the protein folding, assembly, and secretion of the virus. This is the first evidence of positive Darwinian selection in the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2, which contributes to a better understanding of the adaptive mechanism of this virus and help to provide insights for developing novel therapeutic approaches as well as effective vaccines by targeting on mutation sites.","publish_time":1593475200000,"author_summary":" Zhan, Xiao-Yong; Zhang, Ying; Zhou, Xuefu;<br>Huang, Ke; Qian, Yichao; Leng, Yang; Yan, Leping;<br>Huang, Bihui; He, Yulong","abstract_summary":" SARS-CoV-2 caused a global pandemic in early<br>2020 and has resulted in more than 8,000,000<br>infections as well as 430,000 deaths in the world so far.<br>Four structural proteins, envelope (E), membrane<br>(M), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) glycoprotein,<br>play a key role in controlling the entry into human<br>cells and virion assembly of SARS-CoV-2.

Worldwide, SARS-CoV-2 has already infected over 3 million and has killed about 230,000 people. SARS-CoV-2 originated in China and, within three months, has evolved to an additional 10 subtypes. One particular subtype with a non-silent (Aspartate to Glycine) mutation at 614th position of the Spike protein (D614G) rapidly outcompeted other pre-existing subtypes, including the ancestral. We assessed that D614G mutation generates an additional serine protease (Elastase) cleavage site near the S1-S2 junction of the Spike protein. We also identified that a single nucleotide deletion (delC) at a known variant site (rs35074065) in a cis-eQTL of TMPRSS2, is extremely rare in East Asians but is common in Europeans and North Americans. The delC allele facilitates entry of the 614G subtype into host cells, thus accelerating the spread of 614G subtype in Europe and North America where the delC allele is common. The delC allele at the cis-eQTL locus rs35074065 of TMPRSS2 leads to overexpression of both TMPRSS2 and a nearby gene MX1. The cis-eQTL site, rs35074065 overlaps with a transcription factor binding site of an activator (IRF1) and a repressor (IRF2). IRF1 activator can bind to variant delC allele, but IRF2 repressor fails to bind. Thus, in an individual carrying the delC allele, there is only activation, but no repression. On viral entry, IRF1 mediated upregulation of MX1 leads to neutrophil infiltration and processing of 614G mutated Spike protein by neutrophil Elastase. The simultaneous processing of 614G spike protein by TMPRSS2 and Elastase serine proteases facilitates the entry of the 614G subtype into host cells. Thus, SARS-CoV-2, particularly the 614G subtype, has spread more easily and with higher frequency to Europe and North America where the delC allele regulating expression of TMPRSS2 and MX1 host proteins is common, but not to East Asia where this allele is rare.","publish_time":1588636800000,"author_summary":" Bhattacharyya, Chandrika; Das, Chitrarpita;<br>Ghosh, Arnab; Singh, Animesh K.; Mukherjee, Souvik;<br>Majumder, Partha P.; Basu, Analabha; Biswas, Nidhan K.","abstract_summary":" COVID-19 pandemic is a major human tragedy.<br>Worldwide, SARS-CoV-2 has already infected over 3 million<br>and has killed about 230,000 people.

These viral proteins are involved in RNA replication, indicating highly evolved viral strains circulating in the population of USA than other countries.

However, most cases reported in February 2020 were local infections with unknown source, indicating local community transmissions. This study aimed to report the clinical, epidemiological and phylogenomic characteristics of the local cases of COVID-19 in our community. Methods: We extracted the demographic, clinical and epidemiological data from 50 COVID-19 patients, who accounted for 53.8% of the cases in Hong Kong by the end of February 2020. We used both Nanopore and Illumina platforms to perform whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from these patients. Phylogenetic relatedness among these local cases and their placement in the global phylogeny were examined. The evolutionary rate and divergence time of transmission were also determined. Findings: Of these 50 patients, only three (6.0%) had visited Wuhan while 43 (86.0%) did not have recent travel records. The average interval from symptom onset to hospital admission was 8.5 days. The most common signs and symptoms on admission were cough (74.0%) and fever (58.0%). Radiographic abnormality was found in 46 (92.0%) patients. Three (6.0%) patients required ICU admission. Phylogenetic analysis concurred with epidemiological investigation that 42 (84.0%) cases could be grouped into six transmission clusters. Forty-four (88.0%) cases harboured a common mutation Orf3a G251V. Global phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that most (88.0%) cases in Hong Kong were clustered in two subclades with the strains from other countries. The estimated time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of COVID-2019 outbreak in Hong Kong was December 24, 2019 with an evolutionary rate of 3.04x10-3 substitutions per site per year. The reproduction number value was 1.84 as of February 28, 2020 in Hong Kong. Interpretation: We provided a territory-wide overview of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, which has borders connecting to Mainland China.

Efficient identification of subtypes is particularly important for tracking the geographic distribution and temporal dynamics of infectious spread in real-time. In this paper, we utilize an entropy analysis to identify nucleotide sites within SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences that are highly informative of genetic variation, and thereby define an Informative Subtype Marker (ISM) for each sequence. We further apply an error correction technique to the ISMs, for more robust subtype definition given ambiguity and noise in sequence data. We show that, by analyzing the ISMs of global SARS-CoV-2 sequence data, we can distinguish interregional differences in viral subtype distribution, and track the emergence of subtypes in different regions over time. Based on publicly available data up to April 5, 2020, we show, for example: (1) distinct genetic subtypes of infections in Europe, with earlier transmission linked to subtypes prevalent in Italy with later development of subtypes specific to other countries over time; (2) within the United States, the emergence of an endogenous U.S. subtype that is distinct from the outbreak in New York, which is linked instead to subtypes found in Europe; and (3) dynamic emergence of SARS-CoV-2 from localization in China to a pattern of distinct regional subtypes in different countries around the world over time. Our results demonstrate that utilizing ISMs for genetic subtyping can be an important complement to conventional phylogenetic tree-based analyses of the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, because ISMs are efficient and compact subtype identifiers, they will be useful for modeling, data-mining, and machine learning tools to help enhance containment, therapeutic, and vaccine targeting strategies for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. We have made the subtype identification pipeline described in this paper publicly available at https:\/\/github.com\/EESI\/ISM. Author Summary The novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, expanded to reportedly 1.3 million confirmed cases worldwide by April 7, 2020. The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlights the importance of tracking dynamics of viral pandemics in real-time. Through the beginning of April 2020, researchers obtained genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from nearly 4,000 infected individuals worldwide. Since the virus readily mutates, each sequence of an infected individual contains useful information linked to the individual\u2019s exposure location and sample date. But, there are over 30,000 bases in the full SARS-CoV-2 genome \u2014 so tracking genetic variants on a whole-sequence basis becomes unwieldy. We describe a method to instead efficiently identify and label genetic variants, or \u201csubtypes\u201d of SARS-CoV-2. Applying this method results in a compact, 17 base-long label, called an Informative Subtype Marker or \u201cISM.\u201d We define viral subtypes for each ISM, and show how regional distribution of subtypes track the progress of the pandemic. Major findings include (1) showing distinct viral subtypes of infections in Europe emanating from Italy to other countries over time, and (2) tracking emergence of a local subtype across the United States connected to Asia and distinct from the outbreak in New York, which is connected to Europe.","publish_time":1587340800000,"author_summary":" Zhao, Zhengqiao; Sokhansanj, Bahrad A.;<br>Rosen, Gail L.","abstract_summary":" We propose an efficient framework for genetic<br>subtyping of a pandemic virus, with application to the<br>novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

The envelope protein E, the membrane glycoprotein M and ORF7 could have been further benefited by a high rate of A\/T in the third codon position. Thereby, the mistranslation or de-regulation of protein synthesis could produce collateral effects, as a consequence of viral occupancy of the host translation machinery due tomolecular similarities with viral genes.

RESULTS: Between 25 January and 14 April 2020, 1,333 COVID-19 cases were reported in Victoria, with a peak in late March. After applying internal quality control parameters, 903 samples were included in genomic analyses. Sequenced samples from Australia were representative of the global diversity of SARS-CoV-2, consistent with epidemiological findings of multiple importations and limited onward transmission. In total, 76 distinct genomic clusters were identified; these included large clusters associated with social venues, healthcare facilities and cruise ships.

Studying the evolution and transmission patterns in different countries is crucial to implement effective strategies for disease control and prevention. In this work, we present the full genome sequence for 17 SARS-CoV-2 isolates corresponding to the earliest sampled cases in Mexico. Global and local phylogenomics, coupled with mutational analysis, consistently revealed that these viral sequences are distributed within 2 known lineages, the SARS-CoV-2 lineage A\/G, containing mostly sequences from North America, and the lineage B\/S containing mainly sequences from Europe. Based on the exposure history of the cases and on the phylogenomic analysis, we characterized fourteen independent introduction events. Additionally, three cases with no travel history were identified. We found evidence that two of these cases represent local transmission cases occurring in Mexico during mid-March 2020, denoting the earliest events described in the country. Within this Mexican cluster, we also identified an H49Y amino acid change in the spike protein. This mutation is a homoplasy occurring independently through time and space, and may function as a molecular marker to follow on any further spread of these viral variants throughout the country.

We examined full genome sequences currently available to assess the presence of sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies in countries with the highest toll of confirmed cases.

To overcome this absence, I assembled these genomes from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data available for SARS-CoV-2-like viruses detected in five captive pangolins from Guangdong. I found the genome assemblies of GD\/P virus of poor quality, having high levels of missing data. Additionally, unexpected reads in the Illumina sequencing data were identified.

In the four other GD\/P datasets1 many mitochondrial reads from pangolin were identified, as well as from three other species, namely, human, mouse and tiger. Importantly, I only identified three polymorphic nucleotide sites between the five GD\/P sequences. Such low levels of polymorphism may reasonably be accounted for by sequencing errors alone, thus raising the possibility that the five pangolins seized in Guangdong in March 2019 were infected by the same virus strain, most probably during their captivity.","publish_time":1588809600000,"author_summary":" Hassanin, Alexandre","abstract_summary":" Viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2, which<br>is the virus responsible of the Covid-19<br>pandemic, were sequenced in several Sunda pangolins<br>(Manis javanica) seized in the Guangdong and Guangxi<br>provinces of China between 2017 and 20191-3.

Our analysis showed that all Saudi SARS-CoV-2 sequences are of the same origin and closer proximity to bat SARS-like CoVs, followed by SARS-CoVs, however quite distant to MERS-CoV.

Saudi SARS-CoV-2 sequences were found to be likely of the same or similar origin. In our analysis, SARS-CoV-2 were more closely related to bat SARS-like CoVs rather than to MERS-CoV (which originated in Saudi Arabia) or SARS-CoV, confirming other phylogenetic efforts on this pathogen. Recombination and positive selection analysis further suggest that bat coronaviruses may be at the origin of SARS-CoV-2 sequences.

This global sequencing effort is inherently decentralized and must rely on data collected by many labs using a wide variety of molecular and bioinformatic techniques. There is thus a strong possibility that systematic errors associated with lab-specific practices affect some sequences in the repositories. We find that some recurrent mutations in reported SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been observed predominantly or exclusively by single labs, co-localize with commonly used primer binding sites and are more likely to affect the protein coding sequences than other similarly recurrent mutations. We show that their inclusion can affect phylogenetic inference on scales relevant to local lineage tracing, and make it appear as though there has been an excess of recurrent mutation and\/or recombination among viral lineages. We suggest how samples can be screened and problematic mutations removed. We also develop tools for comparing and visualizing differences among phylogenies and we show that consistent clade- and tree-based comparisons can be made between phylogenies produced by different groups. These will facilitate evolutionary inferences and comparisons among phylogenies produced for a wide array of purposes.

As of 30 March 2020, 7,680 consensus sequences have been shared on GISAID, the principal repository for SARS-CoV-2 genetic information. These sequences are primarily consensus sequences from clinical and passaged samples, but few reports have looked at diversity of virus populations within individual hosts or cultures. Understanding such diversity is essential to understanding viral evolutionary dynamics. Here, we characterize within-host viral diversity from a primary isolate and passaged samples, all originally deriving from an individual returning from Wuhan, China, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 and subsequently sampled in Wisconsin, United States. We use a metagenomic approach with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) GridION in combination with Illumina MiSeq to capture minor within-host frequency variants \u22651%. In a clinical swab obtained from the day of hospital presentation, we identify 15 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) \u22651% frequency, primarily located in the largest gene \u2013 ORF1a. While viral diversity is low overall, the dominant genetic signatures are likely secondary to population size changes, with some evidence for mild purifying selection throughout the genome.

Then, we study the evolutionary pressures influencing the codon usage and evolutionary rates of the sequences of five conserved genes that encode the corresponding proteins (viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid) characteristic of coronaviruses. We found different patterns of both mutational bias and nature selection that affect the codon usage of these genes at different extents. Moreover, we show that the two integral membrane proteins proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their genes. Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike proteins are important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster as compared to other ones.

We investigated the first four weeks of emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Scotland after the first case reported on the 1st March 2020. We obtained full genome sequences from 452 individuals with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, representing 20% of all cases until 1st April 2020 (n=2310). This permitted a genomic epidemiology approach to study the introductions and spread of the SARS-2 virus in Scotland. From combined phylogenetic and epidemiological analysis, we estimated at least 113 introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Scotland during this period. Clusters containing multiple sequences suggestive of onward transmission occurred in 48\/86 (56%). 42\/86 (51%) clusters had no known international travel history indicating undetected introductions. The majority of viral sequences were most closely related to those circulating in other European countries, including Italy, Austria and Spain. Travel-associated introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Scotland predated travel restrictions in the UK and other European countries. The first local transmission occurred three days after the first case. A shift from travel-associated to sustained community transmission was apparent after only 11 days. Undetected introductions occurred prior to the first known case of COVID-19. Earlier travel restrictions and quarantine measures might have resulted in fewer introductions into Scotland, thereby reducing the number of cases and the subsequent burden on health services. The high number of introductions and transmission rates were likely to have impacted on national contact tracing efforts.

The rate of synonymous C to U transitions is significantly higher than the rate of nonsynonymous ones, indicating negative selection on amino acid substitutions.

A strong bias in nucleotide usage in fourfold degenerated sites towards uracil residues is seen in ORF1 of all the studied coronaviruses. A more substantial mutational U pressure is observed in ORF1a than in ORF1b owing to the translation of ORF1ab via programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

To this end, phylogenomic approaches leverage accumulating genomic mutations as barcodes to track the evolutionary history of the virus and can benefit from the surge of sequences deposited in public databases. Yet, such methods typically rely on consensus sequences representing the dominant virus lineage, whereas a complex sublineage architecture is often observed within single hosts. Furthermore, most approaches do not account for variants accumulation processes and might produce inaccurate results in condition of limited sampling, as witnessed in most countries affected by the epidemics. We introduce VERSO (Viral Evolution ReconStructiOn), a new comprehensive framework for the characterization of viral evolution and transmission from sequencing data of viral genomes. our approach accounts for accumulation of clonal mutations and uncertainty in the data, by taking advantage of the achievements of research in cancer evolution, to deliver robust phylogenomic lineage models, and exploits intra-host variant frequency profiles to characterize the sublineage similarity among samples, which may derive from uncovered infection events. The application of our approach to RNA-sequencing data of 162 SARS-CoV-2 samples generates a high-resolution model of evolution and spread, which improves recent findings on viral types and highlights the existence of patterns of co-occurrence of minor variants, revealing likely infection paths among hosts harboring the same viral lineage. The in-depth analysis of the mutational landscape of SARS-CoV-2 confirms a statistically significant increase of genomic diversity in time and identifies a number of variants that are transiting from minor to clonal state in the population. We also show that standard phylogenetic methods can produce unreliable results when handling datasets with noise and sampling limitations, as proven by the further application of VERSO to 12419 consensus sequences included in GISAID database. Notably, VERSO allows to pinpoint minor variants that might be positively or negatively selected across distinct lineages, thus driving the design of treatments and vaccines. In particular, minor variant g.29039A>U, detected in multiple viral lineages and validated on independent samples, shows that SARS-CoV-2 can lose its main Nucleocapsid immunogenic epitopes, raising concerns about the effectiveness of vaccines targeting the C-terminus of this protein. Finally, we here release the likely SARS-CoV-2 ancestral genome, obtained by resolving ambiguous SNPs that distinguish two widely-used reference genomes from human samples, by employing the Pangolin-CoV and the Bat-CoV-RaTG13 genomes.

While the Nextstrain and GISAID portals offer widely used systems for the classification of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, both present relevant limitations. Here we propose a highly reproducible method for the systematic classification of SARS-CoV-2 viral types. To demonstrate the validity of our approach, we conduct an extensive comparative genomic analysis of more than 20,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Our classification system delineates 12 clusters and 4 super-clusters in SARS-CoV-2, with a highly biased spatio-temporal distribution worldwide, and provides important observations concerning the evolutionary processes associated with the emergence of novel viral types. Based on the estimates of SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate and genetic distances of genomes of the early pandemic phase, we infer that SARS-CoV-2 could have been circulating in humans since August-November 2019. The observed pattern of genomic variability is remarkably similar between all clusters and super-clusters, being UTRs and the s2m element, a highly conserved secondary structure element, the most variable genomic regions. While several polymorphic sites that are specific to one or more clusters were predicted to be under positive or negative selection, overall, our analyses also suggest that the emergence of novel genome types is unlikely to be driven by widespread convergent evolution and independent fixation of advantageous substitutions. While, in the absence of rigorous experimental validation, several questions concerning the evolutionary processes and the phenotypic characteristics (increased\/decreased virulence) remain open, we believe that the approach outlined in this study can be of relevance for the tracking and functional characterization of different types of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.","publish_time":1593475200000,"author_summary":" Chiara, Matteo; Horner, David S.; Gissi,<br>Carmela; Pesole, Graziano","abstract_summary":" Effective systems for the analysis of<br>molecular data are of fundamental importance for<br>real-time monitoring of the spread of infectious<br>diseases and the study of pathogen evolution.

Using the complete sequences of 1,932 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we examined the genomic, geographic and temporal distributions of aged, new, and frequent mutations of SARS-CoV-2, and identified six phylogenetic clusters of the strains, which also exhibit a geographic preference in different continents. Mutations in the form of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) provide a direct interpretation for the six phylogenetic clusters. Linkage disequilibrium, haplotype structure, evolutionary process, global distribution of mutations unveiled a sketch of the mutational history. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between the average mutation count and case fatality, and this correlation had strengthened with time, suggesting an important role of SNVs on disease outcomes. This study suggests that SNVs may become an important consideration in virus detection, clinical treatment, drug design, and vaccine development to avoid target shifting, and that continued isolation and sequencing is a crucial component in the fight against this pandemic.

Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences, to construct phylogenetic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST software package, was used to calculate the molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs. Results An isolate numbered EPI_ISL_403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and genetic distances of the whole length genome, the coding sequences (CDS) of ployprotein (P), spike protein (S), and nucleoprotein (N) from other 2019-nCoVs.

Several issues concerning the origin, time of introduction to humans, evolutionary patterns, and underlying force driving the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak remain unclear. METHOD: Genetic variation in 137 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and related coronaviruses as of 2\/23\/2020 was analyzed. RESULT: After correcting for mutational bias, the excess of low frequency mutations on both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites was revealed which is consistent with the recent outbreak of the virus. In contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for SARS-CoV during its brief epidemic in 2003, our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes shows signs of relaxation. The sequence similarity in the spike receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and a sequence from pangolin is probably due to an ancient intergenomic introgression that occurred approximately 40 years ago. The current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to have originated on 12\/11\/2019 (95% HPD 11\/13\/2019\u201312\/23\/2019). The effective population size of the virus showed an approximately 20-fold increase from the onset of the outbreak to the lockdown of Wuhan (1\/23\/2020) and ceased to increase afterwards, demonstrating the effectiveness of social distancing in preventing its spread. Two mutations, 84S in orf8 protein and 251 V in orf3 protein, occurred coincidentally with human intervention. The former first appeared on 1\/5\/2020 and plateaued around 1\/23\/2020. The latter rapidly increased in frequency after 1\/23\/2020. Thus, the roles of these mutations on infectivity need to be elucidated. Genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 collected from China is two times higher than those derived from the rest of the world. A network analysis found that haplotypes collected from Wuhan were interior and had more mutational connections, both of which are consistent with the observation that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak originated in China.

This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved in a new host (or new host tissue) with high ZAP expression. A survey of CpG deficiency in viral genomes identified a virulent canine coronavirus (Alphacoronavirus) as possessing the most extreme CpG deficiency, comparable to that observed in SARS-CoV-2.

In this study, we first present robust estimator for the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and the mutation rate, and then apply the approach to analyze 12,909 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2. The mutation rate is inferred to be 8.69 \u00d7 10(-4) per site per year with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [8.61 \u00d7 10(-4), 8.77 \u00d7 10(-4)], and the TMRCA of the samples inferred to be Nov 28, 2019 with a 95% CI of [Oct 20, 2019, Dec 9, 2019]. The results indicate that COVID-19 might originate earlier than and outside of Wuhan Seafood Market. We further demonstrate that genetic polymorphism patterns, including the enrichment of specific haplotypes and the temporal allele frequency trajectories generated from infection clusters, are similar to those caused by evolutionary forces such as natural selection. Our results show that population genetic methods need to be developed to efficiently detangle the effects of sampling bias and infection clusters to gain insights into the evolutionary mechanism of SARS-CoV-2.

Coronaviruses have long and complex genomes with high plasticity in terms of gene content. To date, the coding potential of SARS-CoV-2 remains partially unknown. We thus used available sequences of bat and pangolin viruses to determine the selective events that shaped the genome structure of SARS-CoV-2 and to assess its coding potential. By searching for signals of significantly reduced variability at synonymous sites (dS), we identified six genomic regions, one of these corresponding to the programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshift. The most prominent signal of dS reduction was observed within the E gene. A genome-wide analysis of conserved RNA structures indicated that this region harbors a putative functional RNA element that is shared with the SARS-CoV lineage. Additional signals of reduced dS indicated the presence of internal ORFs. Whereas the presence ORF9a (internal to N) was previously proposed by homology with a well characterized protein of SARS-CoV, ORF3h (for hypothetical, within ORF3a) was not previously described. The predicted product of ORF3h has 90% identity with the corresponding predicted product of SARS-CoV and displays features suggestive of a viroporin. Finally, analysis of the putative ORF10 revealed high dN\/dS (3.82) in SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses. In the SARS-CoV lineage, the ORF is predicted to encode a truncated protein and is neutrally evolving. These data suggest that ORF10 encodes a functional protein in SARS-CoV-2 and that positive selection is driving its evolution. Experimental analyses will be necessary to validate and characterize the coding and non-coding functional elements we identified.","publish_time":1588636800000,"author_summary":" Cagliani, Rachele; Forni, Diego; Clerici,<br>Mario; Sironi, Manuela","abstract_summary":" In December 2019, a novel human-infecting<br>coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was recognized in China.

Methods Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Results Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5\u2019-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3\u2019-part spanning 24,341-30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3\u2019-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch. Conclusions The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely.

The objective of this study was to characterize SARS-CoV-2 sequences from three identified positive cases as on February 29, 2020. METHODS: Throat swab\/nasal swab specimens for a total of 881 suspected cases were screened by E gene and confirmed by RdRp (1), RdRp (2) and N gene real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions and next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis, molecular characterization and prediction of B- and T-cell epitopes for Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences were undertaken. RESULTS: Three cases with a travel history from Wuhan, China, were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. Almost complete (29,851 nucleotides) genomes of case 1, case 3 and a fragmented genome for case 2 were obtained. The sequences of Indian SARS-CoV-2 though not identical showed high (~99.98%) identity with Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus (accession number: NC 045512). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Indian sequences belonged to different clusters. Predicted linear B-cell epitopes were found to be concentrated in the S1 domain of spike protein, and a conformational epitope was identified in the receptor-binding domain. The predicted T-cell epitopes showed broad human leucocyte antigen allele coverage of A and B supertypes predominant in the Indian population. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The two SARS-CoV-2 sequences obtained from India represent two different introductions into the country. The genetic heterogeneity is as noted globally. The identified B- and T-cell epitopes may be considered suitable for future experiments towards the design of vaccines and diagnostics.

We confirmed that mutations in different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 have specific influence on virus reproductive adaptability, allowing for genotype adjustment and adaptations in rapidly changing environments. Moreover, for the first time we identified nine putative recombination patterns in SARS-CoV-2, which encompass spike glycoprotein, RdRp, helicase and ORF3a.

We analyzed the selective events that accompanied the divergence of SARS-CoV-2 from BatCoV RaTG13. To this end, we applied a population genetics-phylogenetics approach, which leverages within-population variation and divergence from an outgroup. Results indicated that most sites in the viral open reading frames (ORFs) evolved under conditions of strong to moderate purifying selection. The most highly constrained sequences corresponded to some nonstructural proteins (nsps) and to the M protein. Conversely, nsp1 and accessory ORFs, particularly ORF8, had a nonnegligible proportion of codons evolving under conditions of very weak purifying selection or close to selective neutrality. Overall, limited evidence of positive selection was detected. The 6 bona fide positively selected sites were located in the N protein, in ORF8, and in nsp1. A signal of positive selection was also detected in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein but most likely resulted from a recombination event that involved the BatCoV RaTG13 sequence. In line with previous data, we suggest that the common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13 encoded\/encodes an RBM similar to that observed in SARS-CoV-2 itself and in some pangolin viruses. It is presently unknown whether the common ancestor still exists and, if so, which animals it infects. Our data, however, indicate that divergence of SARS-CoV-2 from BatCoV RaTG13 was accompanied by limited episodes of positive selection, suggesting that the common ancestor of the two viruses was poised for human infection. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are dangerous zoonotic pathogens; in the last 2 decades, three coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier and caused human epidemics. One of these is the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. We investigated how, since its divergence from a closely related bat virus, natural selection shaped the genome of SARS-CoV-2. We found that distinct coding regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome evolved under conditions of different degrees of constraint and are consequently more or less prone to tolerate amino acid substitutions. In practical terms, the level of constraint provides indications about which proteins\/protein regions are better suited as possible targets for the development of antivirals or vaccines. We also detected limited signals of positive selection in three viral ORFs. However, we warn that, in the absence of knowledge about the chain of events that determined the human spillover, these signals should not be necessarily interpreted as evidence of an adaptation to our species.","publish_time":1590969600000,"author_summary":" Cagliani, Rachele; Forni, Diego; Clerici,<br>Mario; Sironi, Manuela","abstract_summary":" The novel coronavirus severe acute<br>respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that<br>recently emerged in China is thought to have a bat origin,<br>as its closest known relative (BatCoV RaTG13) was<br>described previously in horseshoe bats.

Population genetic analyses of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types (designated L and S), that are well defined by two different SNPs that show nearly complete linkage across the viral strains sequenced to date. Although the L type (\u223c70%) is more prevalent than the S type (\u223c30%), the S type was found to be the ancestral version. Whereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020. Human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the L type, which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly. On the other hand, the S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure.

To understand the early evolutionary events following its emergence, a data set of 985 complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences was assembled. Variants showed a mean of 5.5 to 9.5 nucleotide differences from each other, consistent with a midrange coronavirus substitution rate of 3 \u00d7 10(\u22124) substitutions\/site\/year. Almost one-half of sequence changes were C\u2192U transitions, with an 8-fold base frequency normalized directional asymmetry between C\u2192U and U\u2192C substitutions. Elevated ratios were observed in other recently emerged coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]-CoV), and decreasing ratios were observed in other human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, -OC43, -229E, and -HKU1) proportionate to their increasing divergence. C\u2192U transitions underpinned almost one-half of the amino acid differences between SARS-CoV-2 variants and occurred preferentially in both 5\u2032 U\/A and 3\u2032 U\/A flanking sequence contexts comparable to favored motifs of human APOBEC3 proteins. Marked base asymmetries observed in nonpandemic human coronaviruses (U \u226b A > G \u226b C) and low G+C contents may represent long-term effects of prolonged C\u2192U hypermutation in their hosts. The evidence that much of sequence change in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses may be driven by a host APOBEC-like editing process has profound implications for understanding their short- and long-term evolution. Repeated cycles of mutation and reversion in favored mutational hot spots and the widespread occurrence of amino acid changes with no adaptive value for the virus represent a quite different paradigm of virus sequence change from neutral and Darwinian evolutionary frameworks and are not incorporated by standard models used in molecular epidemiology investigations. IMPORTANCE The wealth of accurately curated sequence data for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), its long genome, and its low substitution rate provides a relatively blank canvas with which to investigate effects of mutational and editing processes imposed by the host cell. The finding that a large proportion of sequence change in SARS-CoV-2 in the initial months of the pandemic comprised C\u2192U mutations in a host APOBEC-like context provides evidence for a potent host-driven antiviral editing mechanism against coronaviruses more often associated with antiretroviral defense. In evolutionary terms, the contribution of biased, convergent, and context-dependent mutations to sequence change in SARS-CoV-2 is substantial, and these processes are not incorporated by standard models used in molecular epidemiology investigations.","publish_time":1592956800000,"author_summary":" Simmonds, P.","abstract_summary":" The pandemic of severe acute respiratory<br>syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has motivated an<br>intensive analysis of its molecular epidemiology<br>following its worldwide spread.

RNA viruses are characterized by a high mutation rate, up to a million times higher than that of their hosts. Virus mutagenic capability depends upon several factors, including the fidelity of viral enzymes that replicate nucleic acids, as SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Mutation rate drives viral evolution and genome variability, thereby enabling viruses to escape host immunity and to develop drug resistance. METHODS: We analyzed 220 genomic sequences from the GISAID database derived from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide from December 2019 to mid-March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 reference genome was obtained from the GenBank database. Genomes alignment was performed using Clustal Omega. Mann\u2013Whitney and Fisher-Exact tests were used to assess statistical significance. RESULTS: We characterized 8 novel recurrent mutations of SARS-CoV-2, located at positions 1397, 2891, 14408, 17746, 17857, 18060, 23403 and 28881. Mutations in 2891, 3036, 14408, 23403 and 28881 positions are predominantly observed in Europe, whereas those located at positions 17746, 17857 and 18060 are exclusively present in North America. We noticed for the first time a silent mutation in RdRp gene in England (UK) on February 9th, 2020 while a different mutation in RdRp changing its amino acid composition emerged on February 20th, 2020 in Italy (Lombardy). Viruses with RdRp mutation have a median of 3 point mutations [range: 2\u20135], otherwise they have a median of 1 mutation [range: 0\u20133] (p value < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the virus is evolving and European, North American and Asian strains might coexist, each of them characterized by a different mutation pattern. The contribution of the mutated RdRp to this phenomenon needs to be investigated. To date, several drugs targeting RdRp enzymes are being employed for SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment. Some of them have a predicted binding moiety in a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp hydrophobic cleft, which is adjacent to the 14408 mutation we identified. Consequently, it is important to study and characterize SARS-CoV-2 RdRp mutation in order to assess possible drug-resistance viral phenotypes. It is also important to recognize whether the presence of some mutations might correlate with different SARS-CoV-2 mortality rates.","publish_time":1587513600000,"author_summary":" Pachetti, Maria; Marini, Bruna; Benedetti,<br>Francesca; Giudici, Fabiola; Mauro, Elisabetta;<br>Storici, Paola; Masciovecchio, Claudio; Angeletti,<br>Silvia; Ciccozzi, Massimo; Gallo, Robert C.; Zella,<br>Davide; Ippodrino, Rudy","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA coronavirus<br>responsible for the pandemic of the Severe Acute<br>Respiratory Syndrome (COVID-19).

To address the complexity of the human microbiome, we describe a method to create a database of all proteins of relevant abundance in the saliva microbiome. By utilizing a protein-based approach to the microbiome we can more accurately identify peptides that will be problematic in COVID-19 studies which removes 12 peptides from consideration. To identify diagnostic peptides, another 7 peptides are flagged for removal following comparison to the proteome backgrounds of viral and bacterial pathogens of similar clinical presentation. By aligning the protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 field isolates deposited to date we can identify peptides for removal due to their presence in highly variable regions that may lead to false negatives as the pathogen evolves. We provide maps of these regions and highlight 3 peptides that should be avoided as potential diagnostic or vaccine targets.

Until now, the intermediate host and mechanisms of interspecies jump of this virus are unknown. METHODS: Phylogenetic analysis of all available bat coronavirus (CoV) complete genomes was performed in order to analyze the relationships between bat CoV and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. In order to suggest a possible intermediate host, another phylogenetic reconstruction of CoV genomes obtained from animals which were hypothetically commercialized in the Chinese markets was also carried out. Moreover, mutation analysis was executed to suggest genomic regions which may have permitted the adaptation of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 to the human host. RESULTS: The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 formed a cluster with the bat CoV isolate RaTG13. Possible CoV interspecies jumps among bat isolates were also observed. The phylogenetic tree reconstructed from CoV strains belonging to different animals demonstrated that SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, bat RaTG13 and pangolin CoV genomes formed a monophyletic cluster, demonstrating that pangolins may be suggested as SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 intermediate hosts. Three AA substitutions localized in the S1 portion of the S gene were observed, some of which have been correlated to structural modifications of the S protein which may facilitate SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 tropism to human cells.

For this purpose, we compared the codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 with that of other viruses belonging to the subfamily of Orthocoronavirinae. We found that SARS-CoV-2 has a high AU content that strongly influences its codon usage, which appears to be better adapted to the human host. We also studied the evolutionary pressures that influence the codon usage of five conserved coronavirus genes encoding the viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. We found different patterns of both mutational bias and natural selection that affect the codon usage of these genes. Moreover, we show here that the two integral membrane proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their corresponding genes. Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike proteins (S), although they are regarded as are important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster in comparison to the two genes mentioned above.

Although the causal relationship among mutations and the features of SARS-CoV-2 such as rapid transmission, pathogenicity, and tropism, remains unclear, our results of genomic mutations in SARS-CoV-2 may help to interpret the interaction between genomic characterization in SARS-CoV-2 and infectivity with the host. METHODS: A total of 4,254 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were collected from the Global Initiative on Sharing all Influenza Data (GISAID). Multiple sequence alignment for phylogenetic analysis and comparative genomic approach for mutation analysis were conducted using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA), and an in-house program based on Perl language, respectively. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains indicated that there were 3 major clades including S, V, and G, and 2 subclades (G.1 and G.2). There were 767 types of synonymous and 1,352 types of non-synonymous mutation. ORF1a, ORF1b, S, and N genes were detected at high frequency, whereas ORF7b and E genes exhibited low frequency. In the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S gene, 11 non-synonymous mutations were observed in the region adjacent to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding site. CONCLUSION: It has been reported that the rapid infectivity and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 associated with host receptor affinity are derived from several mutations in its genes. Without these genetic mutations to enhance evolutionary adaptation, species recognition, host receptor affinity, and pathogenicity, it would not survive.

RESULTS: The median number of intra-host variants was 1-4 in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, which ranged between 0 and 51 in different samples. The distribution of variants on genes was similar to those observed in the population data (110 sequences). However, very few intra-host variants were observed in the population as polymorphism, implying either a bottleneck or purifying selection involved in the transmission of the virus, or a consequence of the limited diversity represented in the current polymorphism data. Although current evidence did not support the transmission of intra-host variants in a person-to-person spread, the risk should not be overlooked. The microbiota in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was similar to those in CAP, either dominated by the pathogens or with elevated levels of oral and upper respiratory commensal bacteria. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 evolves in vivo after infection, which may affect its virulence, infectivity, and transmissibility.

Temporal and spatial analysis of these potentially adaptive mutations revealed that the incidence of some of these sites was declining after having reached an (often local) peak, whereas the frequency of other sites is continually increasing and now exhibit a worldwide distribution. Structural analysis revealed that the mutations are located on the surface of the proteins that modulate biochemical properties. We speculate that this improves binding to cellular proteins and hence represents fine-tuning of adaptation to human cells. Our study has implications for the design of biochemical and clinical experiments to assess whether important properties of SARS-CoV-2 have changed during the epidemic.","publish_time":1593907200000,"author_summary":" Zhao, Jin; Sun, Jiumeng; He, Wan-Ting; Ji,<br>Xiang; Gao, Qi; Zhai, Xiaofeng; Suchard, Marc A.;<br>Hong, Samuel L.; Baele, Guy; Su, Shuo; Zhou, Jiyong;<br>Veit, Michael","abstract_summary":" The COVID-19 pandemic is the most important<br>public health threat in recent history.

METHODS: Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. RESULTS: Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5\u2032-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3\u2032-part spanning 24,341\u201330,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3\u2032-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.

This Spike variant is a defining feature of the most prevalent clade (A2a) of SARS-CoV-2 genomes worldwide. Using phylogenomic data, several groups have proposed that the D614G variant may confer increased transmissibility leading to positive selection, while others have claimed that currently available evidence does not support positive selection. Furthermore, in the A2a clade, this mutation is in linkage disequilibrium with a ORF1b protein variant (P314L), making it difficult to discern the functional significance of the Spike D614G mutation from population genetics alone. Here, we perform site-directed mutagenesis on a human codon-optimized spike protein to introduce the D614G variant and produce SARS-CoV-2-pseudotyped lentiviral particles (S-Virus) with this variant and with D614 Spike. We show that in multiple cell lines, including human lung epithelial cells, that S-Virus carrying the D614G mutation is up to 8-fold more effective at transducing cells than wild-type S-Virus. This provides functional evidence that the D614G mutation in the Spike protein increases transduction of human cells. Further we show that the G614 variant is more resistant to cleavage in vitro and in human cells, which may suggest a possible mechanism for the increased transduction.

To investigate introduction and understand the early transmission dynamics of the virus, we formed the South African Network for Genomics Surveillance of COVID (SANGS_COVID), a network of ten government and university laboratories. Here, we present the first results of this effort, which is a molecular epidemiological study of the first twenty-one SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes sampled in the first port of entry, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), during the first month of the epidemic. By combining this with calculations of the effective reproduction number (R), we aim to shed light on the patterns of infections that define the epidemic in South Africa. METHODS: R was calculated using positive cases and deaths from reports provided by the four major provinces. Molecular epidemiology investigation involved sequencing viral genomes from patients in KZN using ARCTIC protocols and assembling whole genomes using meticulous alignment methods. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian trees, lineage classification and molecular clock calculations. FINDINGS: The epidemic in South Africa has been very heterogeneous. Two of the largest provinces, Gauteng, home of the two large metropolis Johannesburg and Pretoria, and KwaZulu-Natal, home of the third largest city in the country Durban, had a slow growth rate on the number of detected cases. Whereas, Western Cape, home of Cape Town, and the Eastern Cape provinces the epidemic is spreading fast. Our estimates of transmission potential for South Africa suggest a decreasing transmission potential towards R=1 since the first cases and deaths have been reported. However, between 06 May and 18 May 2020, we estimate that R was on average 1.39 (1.04 \u2013 2.15, 95% CI). We also demonstrate that early transmission in KZN, and most probably in all main regions of SA, was associated with multiple international introductions and dominated by lineages B1 and B. The study also provides evidence for locally acquired infections in a hospital in Durban within the first month of the epidemic, which inflated early mortality in KZN. INTERPRETATION: This first report of SANGS_COVID consortium focuses on understanding the epidemic heterogeneity and introduction of SARS-CoV-2 strains in the first month of the epidemic in South Africa. The early introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in KZN included caused a localized outbreak in a hospital, provides potential explanations for the initially high death rates in the province. The current high rate of transmission of COVID-19 in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape highlights the crucial need to strength local genomic surveillance in South Africa.

Two of six Clade 2 nonstructural proteins, NS7b and NS8, were exclusively conserved among 2019-nCoV, BetaCoV_RaTG, and BatSARS-like Cov. NS7b and NS8 have previously been shown to affect immune response signaling in the SARS-CoV experimental model.

While the newly defined subgenera provide much-needed standardisation for commonly cited viruses of public health importance, no method has been proposed for the assignment of subgenus based on partial sequence data, or for sequences that are divergent from the designated holotype reference genomes. Here, we describe the genetic variation of a partial region of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is one of the most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular epidemiology. We infer Bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus sequences and examine clade groupings relative to all subgenus holotype sequences. Our phylogenetic analyses are largely coherent with genome-scale analyses based on designated holotype members for each subgenus. Distance measures between sequences form discrete clusters between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can attribute subgenus or indicate sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both accurately and robustly. We thus propose that partial RdRp sequence data of coronaviruses is sufficient for the attribution of subgenus-level taxonomic classifications and we supply the R package, \u201cMyCoV\u201d, which provides a method for attributing subgenus and assessing the reliability of the attribution. The analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplicons derived from biological samples is the most common modern method for detection and classification of infecting viral agents, such as Coronaviruses. Recent updates to the official standard for taxonomic classification of Coronaviruses, however, may leave researchers unsure as to whether the viral sequences they obtain by these methods can be classified into specific viral taxa due to variations in the sequences when compared to type strains. Here, we present a plausible method for defining genetic dissimilarity cut-offs that will allow researchers to state which taxon their virus belongs to and with what level of certainty.

Finally, five variants destabilize structured elements within the 3\u2019UTR hypervariable region, including the S2M stem loop, raising questions as to the functional relevance of these structures in viral replication.

Usually the host genome is analyzed to diagnose possible diseases in the victim. In this research, the focus is concentrated on the attacker's genome for discovery of its malicious properties. RESULTS: The focus of this research is the microsatellites of both SARS and Covid-19. An accurate and highly efficient computer method for identifying all microsatellites in the genome sequences is discovered and implemented, and it is used to find all microsatellites in the Coronavirus-Covid-19 and SARS2003. The Microsatellite discovery is based on an efficient indexing technique called K-Mer Hash Indexing. The method is called Fast Microsatellite Discovery (FMSD) and it is used for both SARS and Covid-19. A table composed of all microsatellites is reported. There are many differences between SARS and Covid-19, but there is an outstanding difference which requires further investigation.

In December 2019, the world was hit again by a devastating SARS episode that has so far infected almost four million individuals worldwide, with over 200,000 fatalities having already occurred by mid-April 2020, and the infection rate continues to grow exponentially. SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a single stranded RNA pathogen which is characterised by a high mutation rate. It is vital to explore the mutagenic capability of the viral genome that enables SARS-CoV-2 to rapidly jump from one host immunity to another and adapt to the genetic pool of local populations. METHODS: For this study, we analysed 2301 complete viral sequences reported from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. SARS-CoV-2 host genomes were collected from The Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database containing 9 genomes from pangolin-CoV origin and 3 genomes from bat-CoV origin, Wuhan SARS-CoV2 reference genome was collected from GeneBank database. The Multiple sequence alignment tool, Clustal Omega was used for genomic sequence alignment. The viral replicating enzyme, 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CL(pro)) that plays a key role in its pathogenicity was used to assess its affinity with pharmacological inhibitors and repurposed drugs such as anti-viral flavones, biflavanoids, anti-malarial drugs and vitamin supplements. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that bat-CoV shares > 96% similar identity, while pangolin-CoV shares 85.98% identity with Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 genome. This in-depth analysis has identified 12 novel recurrent mutations in South American and African viral genomes out of which 3 were unique in South America, 4 unique in Africa and 5 were present in-patient isolates from both populations. Using state of the art in silico approaches, this study further investigates the interaction of repurposed drugs with the SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) enzyme, which regulates viral replication machinery. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study provides insights into the evolving mutations, with implications to understand viral pathogenicity and possible new strategies for repurposing compounds to combat the nCovid-19 pandemic.","publish_time":1594252800000,"author_summary":" Chitranshi, Nitin; Gupta, Vivek K.; Rajput,<br>Rashi; Godinez, Angela; Pushpitha, Kanishka; Shen,<br>Ting; Mirzaei, Mehdi; You, Yuyi; Basavarajappa,<br>Devaraj; Gupta, Veer; Graham, Stuart L.","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory<br>syndrome (SARS) has been initiating pandemics since the<br>beginning of the century.
