2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a major public health problem.It was reported that COVID-19 patients with a past history of cardiovascular diseases would have a higher mortality.The aim of our review is to describe the cardiological features of COVID-19 patients at admission, the acute cardiac presentation, the clinical outcome for patients with underlying CVD and the pharmacological implications for disease management.Therefore, drug-drug interactions should be considered in AD patients while receiving COVID-19 treatment.The presence of myocarditis, cardiac arrest, and acute heart failure in COVID-19 patients suggests the existence of a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiac disease.",
