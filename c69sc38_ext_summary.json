it also suggests immediate measures and recommendations that also apply to other specialties.With the growing COVID-19 pandemic stretching limited healthcare resources, postponing surgery becomes an inevitable and unenviable task for most orthopaedic surgeons, and a shift in outpatient paradigms is required to mitigate poor outcomes in patients.As the paradigm for outpatient surgery shifts due to technological advances and the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical for surgeons to time their surgery appropriately to maintain the high standards of orthopaedic practice.", "title_summ": "The orthopaedic and traumatology scenario during Covid-19 outbreak in Italy: chronicles of a silent warGlobal experience of orthopaedic trauma surgeons facing COVID-19: a survey highlighting the global orthopaedic responseChanges of clinical activities in an orthopaedic institute in North Italy during the spread of COVID-19 pandemic: a seven-week observational analysisThe role of an Orthopaedic Surgeon in the time of Covid-19 Pandemic\u2013a German perspectiveRevisiting conservative orthopaedic management of fractures during COVID-19 pandemicEffect of COVID-19 on Hip and Knee Arthroplasty Surgical Volume in the United StatesLimiting spread of COVID-19 in an orthopaedic department\u2014a perspective from SpainOut Patient Department practices in orthopaedics amidst COVID-19: The evolving modelChange in practice due to COVID-19 \u2013 Early experiences of a United Kingdom district general hospital in trauma & orthopaedicsEvaluating the Effects of COVID-19 on Plastic Surgery Emergencies: Protocols and Analysis from a Level I Trauma CenterTime-sensitive ambulatory orthopaedic soft-tissue surgery paradigms during the COVID-19 pandemicCOVID-19 Impact on Young Arthroplasty SurgeonsLessons learnt from COVID 19: An Italian multicentric epidemiological study of orthopaedic and trauma servicesImpact of COVID 19 lockdown on orthopaedic surgeons in India: A survey()Outcome of trauma and orthopaedic surgery at a UK District General Hospital during the Covid-19 pandemicCritical adjustments in a department of orthopaedics through the COVID-19 pandemicOrthopaedic Walk-In Clinics: A model to lessen the burden on Emergency Departments during the COVID-19 pandemic()Survey of AAHKS International Members on the Impact of COVID-19 on Hip and Knee Arthroplasty PracticesStrategies in reconfiguration of hand injuries management during COVID-19 pandemicReturning to orthopaedic business as usual after COVID-19: strategies and optionsIntervention Protocol of the Orthopedics and Traumatology Department of a High-Complexity University Hospital to Cope with the COVID-19 PandemicManaging hand and reconstructive microsurgery service during COVID-19 pandemic: Singapore experienceWie stark trifft die Corona-Pandemie die Kliniken f\u00fcr Orthop\u00e4die und Unfallchirurgie?: Eine Analyse der ersten 5 WochenCOVID-19 and orthopaedic surgeons: the Indian scenarioArthroscopy and COVID-19: Impact of the Pandemic on Our Surgical PracticesMassive cutback in orthopaedic healthcare services due to the COVID-19 pandemicCOVID-19 Pandemic and its Impact on Plastic Surgery in Europe -History of the Pan African Paediatric Surgery Association (PAPSA)[Orthopedics between reason and passion.An ESPRAS Survey.\ufeffEASAPS/ESPRAS Considerations in getting back to work in Plastic Surgery with the COVID-19 Pandemic - A European point of view.", "title_abstract_phrases": "Although some guidelines for patient care in orthopaedic practice have been published, overall, publications focusing exclusively on guidelines on starting orthopaedic outpatient departments (OPD) after the COVID-19 lockdown amidst the on-going pandemic are lacking.The results of this study show that orthopaedic trauma departments across the world have been greatly impacted by COVID-19 with 91% of participating hospitals currently having a reduced case load compared with pre-COVID-19 and only 17% of respondents currently performing elective orthopaedic surgery.Massive cutback in orthopaedic healthcare services due to the COVID-19 pandemicPURPOSE: Due to the lack of evidence, it was the aim of the study to investigate current possible cutbacks in orthopaedic healthcare due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (COVID-19).Revisiting conservative orthopaedic management of fractures during COVID-19 pandemicCOVID-19 pandemic has brought the need to revisit the conservative management of orthopaedic injuries back into sharp focus.This article highlights the challenges in the triaging of patients, care in dealing with a patient with COVID-19 in orthopaedic surgery, and the effects on academics and research activities;
