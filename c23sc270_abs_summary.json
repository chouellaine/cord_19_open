{"cluster": 23, "subcluster": 270, "abstract_summ": " We extend the classical SIR epidemic spread model by introducing the \"quarantined\" compartment . We solve (numerically) the differential equations that govern the extended model and quantify how quarantining \"flattens the curve\" for the proportion of infected population over time . We explore the potential of using drones to deliver tests, enabling mass-testing for the infection ."}
