{"cluster": 23, "subcluster": 170, "abstract_summ": " In recent weeks, several seroprevalence studies have appeared which attempt to determine the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in certain European and American locations . Many of these studies find an antibody prevalence comparable to the false positive rate of their respective serology tests and the relatively low statistical power associated with each study has invited criticism . We find evidence for non-trivial levels of antibody prevalence across all study locations ."}
