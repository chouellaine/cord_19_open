{"cluster": 13, "subcluster": 7, "abstract_summ": " The fast accumulation of viral metagenomic data has contributed significantly to new RNA virus discovery . However, the short read size, complex composition, and large data size can all make taxonomic analysis difficult . In this work, we present a novel hierarchical classification model named CHEER, which can conduct read-level taxonomic classification from order to genus for new species ."}
