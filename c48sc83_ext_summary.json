of predictors of disease severity and outcomes in COVID-19 patients: a descriptive and retrospective studyAbstract Background The severity and outcome of COVID-19 cases has been associated with percentage of circulating lymphocytes (LYM%), levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT), lactic acid (LA) and viral load (ORF1ab Ct).Clinical research efforts should examine effects of strategies such as arginase inhibition alone and/or inhaled nitric oxide to ameliorate the effects of elevated NLR.Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as an independent risk factor for mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19BACKGROUND: Several studies have described the clinical characteristics of patients with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19), indicating severe patients tended to have higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR)."}
