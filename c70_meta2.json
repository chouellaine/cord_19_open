This study was performed to describe the anesthesia service in one main public hospital during an 8-month medical mission in Cambodia and evaluate its anesthetic safety issues according to the ISSPA. METHODS: We conduct a retrospective study involving 1953 patients at the Preah Ket Mealea hospital. Patient demographics, anesthetic techniques, and complications were reviewed according to the registers of the anesthetic services and questionnaires. The inadequacies in personnel, facilities, equipment, medications, and conduct of anesthesia drugs were recorded using a checklist based on the ISSPA. RESULTS: A total of 1792 patients received general and regional anesthesia in the operating room, while 161 patients receiving sedation for gastroscopy. The patients\u2019 mean age was 45.0 \u00b1 16.6 years (range, 17\u201387 years). The three most common surgical procedures were abdominal (52.0%; confidence interval [CI], 49.3\u201354.7), orthopedic (27.6%; CI, 25.2\u201329.9), and urological surgery (14.7%; CI, 12.8\u201316.6). General anesthesia, spinal anesthesia, and brachial plexus block were performed in 54.3% (CI, 51.7\u201356.8), 28.2% (CI, 25.9\u201330.5), and 9.4% (CI, 7.9\u201310.9) of patients, respectively. One death occurred. Twenty-six items related to professional aspects, monitoring, and conduct of anesthesia did not meet the ISSPA-recommended standards. A lack of commonly used drugs and monitoring equipment was noted, posing major threats to the safety of anesthesia practice, especially in emergency situations. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the scarce literature on anesthesia practice in low- and middle-income countries such as Cambodia. Future medical assistance should help to strengthen these countries\u2019 inadequacies, allowing for the adoption of international standards for the safe practice of anesthesia.","publish_time":1583971200000,"author_summary":" Tao, Kun-ming; Sokha, Sann; Yuan, Hong-bin","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: The International Standards for a<br>Safe Practice of Anesthesia (ISSPA) were developed<br>on behalf of the World Federation of Societies of<br>Anaesthesiologists and the World Health Organization.

BACKGROUND Tracheostomy is often performed for prolonged endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients. However, in the context of COVID-19, tracheostomy placement pathways have been altered due to the poor prognosis of intubated patients as well as the risk of transmission to providers through this highly aerosolizing procedure. METHODS A prospective single-system multi-center observational cohort study was performed on patients who underwent tracheostomy following acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. RESULTS Of the 53 patients who underwent tracheostomy, the average time from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy was 19.7 days \u00b1 6.9 days. The most common indication for tracheostomy was ARDS, followed by failure to wean ventilation and post-ECMO decannulation. 30 patients (56.6%) were liberated from the ventilator, 16 (30.2%) have been discharged alive, 7 (13.2%) have been decannulated, and 6 (11.3%) died. The average time from tracheostomy to ventilator liberation was 11.8 days \u00b1 6.9 days (range 2 - 32 days). Both open surgical and percutaneous dilational tracheostomy techniques were performed utilizing methods to mitigate aerosols. No healthcare worker transmissions resulted from performing the procedure. CONCLUSIONS Alterations to tracheostomy practices and processes were successfully instituted.

DESIGN: This was a retrospective, multicenter clinical study. SETTING: This study used a multicenter dataset from 4 hospitals in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Patients and health care providers with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV from January 23 to 31, 2020, at the Wuhan Union Hospital, the Wuhan Children's Hospital, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, and the Wuhan Fourth Hospital in Wuhan, China. INTERVENTIONS: Anesthetic management and infection control guidelines for emergency procedures for patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were drafted and applied in 4 hospitals in Wuhan. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cross-infection in the operating rooms of the 4 hospitals was effectively reduced by implementing the new measures and procedures. The majority of patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection or suspected infection were female (23 [62%] of 37), and the mean age was 41.0 years old (standard deviation 19.6; range 4-78). 10 (27%) patients had chronic medical illnesses, including 4 (11%) with diabetes, 8 (22%) with hypertension, and 8 (22%) with digestive system disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This paper gathers the opinions of experts of the Laryngotracheal Stenosis Committee of the European Laryngological Society, with the aim of alerting the medical community about the possible rise in number of COVID-19-related laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS), and the aspiration of paving the way to a more rationale concentration of these cases within referral specialist airway centers. RESULTS: A range of prevention strategies, diagnostic work-up, and therapeutic approaches are reported and framed within the COVID-19 pandemic context. CONCLUSIONS: One of the most important roles of otolaryngologists when encountering airway-related signs and symptoms in patients with previous ICU hospitalization for COVID-19 is to maintain a high level of suspicion for LTS development, and share it with colleagues and other health care professionals.

Tracheostomy is not recommended by current guidelines as it is considered a super-spreading event due to aerosolization that unduly risks healthcare workers. Methods Patients with severe COVID-19 that were on mechanical ventilation \u2265 5 days were evaluated for percutaneous dilational tracheostomy. We developed a novel percutaneous tracheostomy technique that placed the bronchoscope alongside the endotracheal tube, not inside it. This improved visualization during the procedure and continued standard mechanical ventilation after positioning the inflated endotracheal tube cuff in the distal trachea. This technique offers a significant mitigation for the risk of virus aerosolization during the procedure. Results From March 10 to April 15, 2020, 270 patients with COVID-19 required invasive mechanical ventilation at New York University Langone Health Manhattan\u2019s campus of which 98 patients underwent percutaneous dilational tracheostomy. The mean time from intubation to the procedure was 10.6 days (SD \u00b15 days). Currently, thirty-two (33%) patients do not require mechanical ventilatory support, 19 (19%) have their tracheostomy tube downsized and 8 (8%) were decannulated. Forty (41%) patients remain on full ventilator support, while 19 (19%) are weaning from mechanical ventilation. Seven (7%) died as result of respiratory and multiorgan failure.

In this Letter to the Editor we would like to present our experience with tracheostomy in a Hub Covid Hospital. METHODS: 8 patients underwent open tracheostomy in case of intubation prolonged over 14 days, bronchopulmonary overlap infections, and patients undergoing weaning. They were followed up and the number and timing of death were recorded. RESULTS: Two patients died after tracheostomy; the median time between tracheostomy and death was 3 days. A negative prognostic trend was observed for a shorter duration of intubation. CONCLUSION: In our experience, tracheostomy does not seem to influence the clinical course and prognosis of the disease, in the face of possible risks of contagion for healthcare workers. The indication for tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients should be carefully evaluated and reserved for selected patients.

In the operating room, as part of hospital outbreak response measures, anesthesiologists are required to have heightened precautions and tailor anesthetic practices to individual patients. In particular, by minimizing the many aerosol-generating procedures performed during general anesthesia, anesthesiologists can reduce exposure to patients\u2019 respiratory secretions and the risk of perioperative viral transmission to healthcare workers and other patients. To avoid any airway manipulation, regional anesthesia should be considered whenever surgery is planned for a suspect or confirmed COVID-19 patient or any patient who poses an infection risk. Regional anesthesia has benefits of preservation of respiratory function, avoidance of aerosolization and hence viral transmission. This article explores the practical considerations and recommended measures for performing regional anesthesia in this group of patients, focusing on control measures geared towards ensuring patient and staff safety, equipment protection, and infection prevention. By doing so, we hope to address an issue that may have downstream implications in the way we practice infection control in anesthesia, with particular relevance to this new era of emerging infectious diseases and novel pathogens. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is not the first, and certainly will not be the last novel virus that will lead to worldwide outbreaks. Having a well thought out regional anesthesia plan to manage these patients in this new normal will ensure the best possible outcome for both the patient and the perioperative management team.","publish_time":1585008000000,"author_summary":" Lie, Sui An; Wong, Sook Wai; Wong, Loong Tat;<br>Wong, Theodore Gar Ling; Chong, Shin Yuet","abstract_summary":" Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a<br>pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March<br>2020 because of its rapid worldwide spread.

Standard practises that have evolved to minimise the risks associated with tracheostomy must be comprehensively reviewed in light of the numerous potential episodes for aerosol generating procedures. We meet the urgent need for safe practise standards by presenting the experience of two major London teaching hospitals, and synthesise our findings into an evidence-based guideline for multidisciplinary care of the tracheostomy patient. METHODS: This is a narrative review presenting the extensive experience of over 120 patients with tracheostomy, with a pragmatic analysis of currently available evidence for safe tracheostomy care in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Tracheostomy care involves many potentially aerosol generating procedures which may pose a risk of viral transmission to staff and patients. We make a series of recommendations to ameliorate this risk through infection control strategies, equipment modification, and individualised decannulation protocols. In addition, we discuss the multidisciplinary collaboration that is absolutely fundamental to safe and effective practise. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 requires a radical rethink of many tenets of tracheostomy care, and controversy continues to exist regarding the optimal techniques to minimise risk to patients and healthcare workers. Safe practise requires a coordinated multidisciplinary team approach to infection control, weaning and decannulation, with integrated processes for continuous prospective data collection and audit.","publish_time":1592352000000,"author_summary":" Rovira, Aleix; Dawson, Deborah; Walker,<br>Abigail; Tornari, Chrysostomos; Dinham, Alison;<br>Foden, Neil; Surda, Pavol; Archer, Sally; Lonsdale,<br>Dagan; Ball, Jonathan; Ofo, Enyi; Karagama, Yakubu;<br>Odutoye, Tunde; Little, Sarah; Simo, Ricard; Arora,<br>Asit","abstract_summary":" PURPOSE: Traditional critical care dogma<br>regarding the benefits of early tracheostomy during<br>invasive ventilation has had to be revisited due to the<br>risk of COVID-19 to patients and healthcare staff.<br>Standard practises that have evolved to minimise the<br>risks associated with tracheostomy must be<br>comprehensively reviewed in light of the numerous potential<br>episodes for aerosol generating procedures.

We conducted a thorough search of the available literature of airway management of COVID-19 across a variety of international settings. In addition, we have analyzed various medical professional body recommendations for common procedural practices such as interventional cardiology, gastroenterology, and pulmonology. A systematic process that aims to protect the operators involved via appropriate personal protective equipment, avoidance of unnecessary patient contact and minimalization of periprocedural aerosol generation are key components to successful airway management. For operating room cases requiring general anesthesia or complex interventional procedures, tracheal intubation should be the preferred option. For interventional procedures, when tracheal intubation is not indicated, cautious conscious sedation appears to be a reasonable approach. Awake intubation should be avoided unless it is absolutely necessary. Extubation is a high-risk procedure for aerosol and droplet spread and needs thorough planning and preparation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current literature was reviewed, quantitative and qualitative analyses of droplet formation during tracheostomy tube change in n = 8 patients were performed, and an overview of and checklist for tracheostomy tube change were compiled. RESULTS: This study demonstrates that tracheostomy tube change, in particular insertion of the new tube, may cause significant droplet formation. The aerosolization of particles smaller than 5 \u00b5m was not analyzed.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease produced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is remarkable for persistent, severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation that places considerable strain on critical care resources. Because recovery from COVID-19\u2013associated respiratory failure can be prolonged, tracheostomy may facilitate patient management and optimize the use of mechanical ventilators. Several important considerations apply to plan tracheostomies for COVID-19\u2013infected patients. After performing a literature review of tracheostomies during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, we synthesized important learning points from these experiences and suggested an approach for perioperative teams involved in these procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multidisciplinary teams should be involved in decisions regarding timing and appropriateness of the procedure. As the theoretical risk of disease transmission is increased during aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), stringent infectious precautions are warranted. Personal protective equipment (PPE) should be available and worn by all personnel present during tracheostomy. The number of people in the room should be limited to those absolutely necessary. Using the most experienced available operators will minimize the total time that staff is exposed to an infectious aerosolized environment. An approach that secures the airway in the safest and quickest manner will minimize the time any part of the airway is open to the environment. Deep neuromuscular blockade (train-of-four ratio = 0) will facilitate surgical exposure and prevent aerosolization due to patient movement or coughing. For percutaneous tracheostomies, the bronchoscopist should be able to reintubate if needed. Closed-loop communication must occur at all times among members of the team. If possible, after tracheostomy is performed, waiting until the patient is virus-free before changing the cannula or downsizing may reduce the chances of health care worker infection. Tracheostomies in COVID-19 patients present themselves as extremely high risk for all members of the procedural team. To mitigate risk, systematic meticulous planning of each procedural step is warranted along with strict adherence to local\/institutional protocols.","publish_time":1591056000000,"author_summary":" Gosling, Andre F.; Bose,, Somnath; Gomez,<br>Ernest; Parikh,, Mihir; Cook, Charles; Sarge, Todd;<br>Shaefi, Shahzad; Leibowitz, Akiva","abstract_summary":" The morbidity, mortality, and blistering pace<br>of transmission of infection with severe acute<br>respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to<br>an unprecedented worldwide health crisis.<br>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease produced<br>by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is remarkable for<br>persistent, severe respiratory failure requiring<br>mechanical ventilation that places considerable strain<br>on critical care resources.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of parturients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection disease (COVID-19). Their epidemiologic history, chest computed tomography scans, laboratory measurements, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity were evaluated. We also recorded the patients\u2019 demographic and clinical characteristics, anesthesia and surgery-related data, maternal and neonatal complications, as well as the health status of the involved medical staff. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of 17 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those previously reported in non-pregnant adult patients. All of the 17 patients underwent Cesarean delivery with anesthesia performed according to standardized anesthesia\/surgery procedures. Fourteen of the patients underwent continuous epidural anesthesia with 12 experiencing significant intraoperative hypotension. Three patients received general anesthesia with tracheal intubation because emergency surgery was needed. Three of the parturients are still recovering from their Cesarean delivery and are receiving in-hospital treatment for COVID-19. Three neonates were born prematurely. There were no deaths or serious neonatal asphyxia events. All neonatal SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were negative. No medical staff were infected throughout the patient care period. CONCLUSIONS: Both epidural and general anesthesia were safely used for Cesarean delivery in the parturients with COVID-19. Nevertheless, the incidence of hypotension during epidural anesthesia appeared excessive. Proper patient transfer, medical staff access procedures, and effective biosafety precautions are important to protect medical staff from COVID-19.","publish_time":1584316800000,"author_summary":" Chen, Rong; Zhang, Yuan; Huang, Lei; Cheng,<br>Bi-heng; Xia, Zhong-yuan; Meng, Qing-tao","abstract_summary":" PURPOSE: To assess the management and safety of<br>epidural or general anesthesia for Cesarean delivery in<br>parturients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and their<br>newborns, and to evaluate the standardized procedures<br>for protecting medical staff.

There is current uncertainty regarding the role of tracheostomy for weaning ventilated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

RESULTS: A synthesis of the current international literature and reported experience is presented with respect to prognosis, viral load and staff safety, thus leading to a pragmatic recommendation that tracheostomy is not performed until at least 14 days after endotracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients. Practical steps to minimise aerosol generation in percutaneous tracheostomy are outlined and we describe the process and framework for setting up a dedicated tracheostomy team. CONCLUSION: In selected COVID-19 patients, there is a role for tracheostomy to aid in weaning and optimise healthcare resource utilisation. Both percutaneous and open techniques can be performed safely with careful modifications to technique and appropriate enhanced personal protective equipment.
