Limited data on corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19 were reported.Effects of Anticoagulants and Corticosteroids therapy in patients affected by severe COVID-19 PneumoniaBackground In the absence of a standard of treatment for COVID-19, the combined use of anti-inflammatory (corticosteroids and Enoxaparin) and antiviral drugs may be more effective than using either modality alone in the treatment of COVID-19.Clinicians should be cautious while using corticosteroid treatment in this patient group.However, for patients with severe viral pneumonia, the corticosteroid treatment is highly controversial."}
