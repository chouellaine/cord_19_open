Results The performances of the LIAISON\u00aeSARS-CoV-2 satisfied all the acceptance criteria and provided \"real world\" analytical and clinical performances very close to the ones reported by the manufacturer in its insert kit.", "title_summ": "Concordance of \"rapid\" serological tests and IgG and IgM chemiluminescence for SARS-COV-2Analytical performance of lateral flow immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 exposure screening on venous and capillary blood samplesDiagnostic accuracy of an automated chemiluminescent immunoassay for anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 IgM and IgG antibodies: an Italian experienceComparison of the Elecsys\u00ae Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay with the EDI(TM) enzyme linked immunosorbent assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in human plasmaEvaluation of two automated and three rapid lateral flow immunoassays for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodiesAnalytical performances of a chemiluminescence immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG and antibody kinetics.Validation of a chemiluminescent assay for specific SARS-CoV-2 antibody.", "title_abstract_phrases": "METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured with the Elecsys\u00ae assay and the EDI(TM) ELISAs (IgM and IgG) in 64 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients with serial blood samples (n=104) collected at different time points from symptom onset.Methods A diagnostic test evaluation assay was performed to establish the performance of five rapid tests (4 immunochromatographic and 1 immunofluorescent tests) for IgG and IgM serology for SARS-CoV-2 using a panel of 30 serum samples from patients received in the laboratory analysis routine.Given the high demand and supply in the market of \"rapid serological tests\", its evaluation against panels of serologically positive or negative samples established by Chemiluminescence or Electro chemiluminescence is essential to authorize its extensive use in populations Funding NoneAnalytical performance of lateral flow immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 exposure screening on venous and capillary blood samplesObjectives: Numerous serologic immunoassays have been launched to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, including rapid tests.Furthermore, we show that capillary blood obtained by finger stick shows similar sensitivity for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies as venous blood samples.CONCLUSION: This study shows accurate and equivalent performance of the five serological antibody assays (ELISA, CLIA and three lateral flow tests) in detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 14 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms."}
