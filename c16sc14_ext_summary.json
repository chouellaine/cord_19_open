suggesting that ACEIs/ARBs are not associated with the severity or mortality of COVID-19 in such patients.Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted using COVID-19 patients previously diagnosed with hypertension before COVID-19 onset.Findings: Of 234427 suspected COVID-19 patients we screened, 1585 hypertension patients were analyzed.Introduction: Angiotensin converting enzyme
