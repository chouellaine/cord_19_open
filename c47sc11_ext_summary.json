The objective of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza A or B in 2017\u20132018 influenza season.The proportion of patients with complicated influenza did not differ between influenza A and B. CONCLUSIONS: Complicated hospitalizations occurred in over 10% of patients hospitalized with influenza virus infection.Here, we describe influenza virus strain circulation in the GIHSN participant countries during 2017\u20132018 season and examine factors associated with complicated hospitalization among patients admitted with laboratory-confirmed influenza illness.Out of these, 8 829 (29.8%) were influenza positive, 6 655 (75.4%) of whom were influenza A and 2 174 (24.6%) were influenza B.
