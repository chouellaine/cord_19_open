{"cluster": 23, "subcluster": 116, "abstract_summ": " We combine COVID-19 case data with demographic and mobility data to estimate a modified susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model for the spread of this disease in the United States . We find that the incidence of infectious COVI-19 individuals has a concave effect on contagion, as would be expected if people have inter-related social networks . counties with the lowest population density could likely avoid high levels of contagion even with no social distancing ."}
