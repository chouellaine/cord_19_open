{"cluster": 23, "subcluster": 283, "abstract_summ": " A key challenge for estimating the epidemiological parameters of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan is the discrepancy between the officially reported number of infections and the true number in the city . Here, we propose a method to dynamically estimate the epidemic parameters by recovering true numbers of infections from day-to-day official numbers . Using the method, we provide a comprehensive retrospection on how the disease had progressed from January 19 to March 5, 2020 ."}
