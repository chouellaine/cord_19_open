Hopkins, as President of British Rhinological Society, published a letter describing \"the loss of sense of smell as a marker of COVID-19 infection\" and proposed that adults presenting with anosmia but no other symptoms should self-isolate for seven days.More, they warrant serious consideration for self-isolation and testing those patients\".BACKGROUND Emerging reports suggest that new onset of smell or taste loss are potential early clinical markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it remains unclear as to what extent.", "title_summ": "More than just smell - COVID-19 is associated with severe impairment of smell, taste, and chemesthesisLoss of smell and taste in combination with other symptoms is a strong predictor of COVID-19 infectionMore than smell \u2013 COVID-19 is associated with severe impairment of smell, taste, and chemesthesisSniffing out the evidence; It's now time for public health bodies recognize the link between COVID-19 and smell and taste disturbance.Self-reported alteration of sense of smell or taste in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis on 3563 patients.", "title_abstract_phrases": "Of those, n=1702 reported having had a RT-PCR COVID-19 test and gave full report on symptoms including loss of smell and taste; 579 were positive and 1123 negative.CONCLUSIONS Based on this meta-analysis, we recommend self-isolation and testing, where possible, for patients complaining smell or taste impairment during COVID-19 pandemic in order to prevent spread of disease and propose the inclusion of loss of smell and taste as recognized symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 in the World Health Organization and other relevant regulatory body's lists.This is particularly relevant to healthcare and other key workers in constant contact with the public who have not yet been tested for COVID-19.More than smell \u2013 COVID-19 is associated with severe impairment of smell, taste, and chemesthesisRecent anecdotal and scientific reports have provided evidence of a link between COVID-19 and chemosensory impairments such as anosmia.In this subset, we find that loss of smell and taste were present in 59% of COVID-19 positive individuals compared to 18% of those negative to the test, yielding an odds ratio (OR) of COVID-19 diagnosis of OR[95%CI]=6.59[5.25; 8.27], P= 1.90x10-59 .More than just smell - COVID-19 is associated with severe impairment of smell, taste, and chemesthesisRecent anecdotal and scientific reports have provided evidence of a link between COVID-19 and chemosensory impairments such as anosmia."}
