{"cluster": 62, "subcluster": 24, "abstract_summ": "Here, we implement an original virtual screening (VS) protocol for repositioning approved drugs in order to predict which of them could inhibit the main protease of the virus (M-pro), a key target for antiviral drugs given its essential role in the virus\u2019 replication.In this study, we combined drugs repurposing and virtual drug screening strategies to target 3CLpro, which has an essential role in viral maturation and replication.Drug repurposing can expedite the process of drug development by identifying known drugs which are effective against SARS-CoV-2.Because of time consuming process of new drug development, drug repositioning may be the only solution to the epidemic of sudden infectious diseases.The strategy in virtual screening of antiviral databases for possible therapeutic effect would be to identify promising drug molecules, as there is currently no vaccine or treatment approved against COVID-19.",
