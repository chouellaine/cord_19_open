several candidates displayed efficacy in vitro studies but few progressed to clinical trials.There has been an unprecedented rapid response by vaccine developers with now over one hundred vaccine candidates in development and at least six having reached clinical trials.Accordingly, numerous vaccines are under development.Animal models allowed scientists to determine the underlying mechanism for the former in the case of Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine and have been utilized to design and screen new RSV vaccine candidates.With the scale and severity of infection, number of

Challenge Studies to Accelerate Coronavirus Vaccine LicensureControlled human challenge trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates could accelerate the testing and potential rollout of efficacious vaccines.Although COVID\u201019 is caused by a new coronavirus, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, previous research on other coronavirus vaccines, such as FIPV, SARS and MERS, has provided valuable information for the rapid development of COVID\u201019 vaccine.While the availability of newer technologies has facilitated development, there are several challenges on the way including limited understanding of the pathophysiology, targeting humoral or mucosal immunity, lack of suitable animal model, poor success of human severe acute respiratory syndrome/Middle East Respiratory Syndrome vaccines, limited efficacy of influenza vaccines, and immune exaggeration with animal coronavirus vaccines.Based on previous experience with SARS-CoV vaccines, it is expected that all COVID-19 vaccines will require careful safety evaluations for immunopotentiation that could lead to increased infectivity or eosinophilic infiltration."}
