{"cluster": 20, "subcluster": 38, "abstract_summ": " Loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) is an isothermal amplification technique favored in diagnostics and point-of-care work . The amplicons resulting from a LAMP reaction varied in length and shape, making them undiscernible on a double-stranded DNA intercalating dye stained gel . We aimed to standardize our characterization of LAMP products during assay development by using fluorescein amidite (FAM) and biotin-tagged loop forward and backward primers . FAM bands are directly correlated with the LAMP visual readout ."}
