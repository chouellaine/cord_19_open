{"cluster": 9, "subcluster": 2, "abstract_summ": " In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved tremendous success in high-dimensional and large-scale space control and sequential decision-making tasks . However, the current model-free DRL methods suffer from low sample efficiency, which limits their performance . In this paper, we introduce a model called Curiosity-driven Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)"}
