{"cluster": 7, "subcluster": 11, "abstract_summ": " In this paper we propose an encoding of a Pseudo-Boolean goal function that can be provided to a SAT-solver only once . Then, during an optimization process, different bounds on the value of the function can be given to the solver by appropriate sets of assumptions . The experimental results show that the proposed technique is sound, that is, it increases the number of solved instances ."}
