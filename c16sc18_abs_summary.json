{"cluster": 16, "subcluster": 18, "abstract_summ": " The novel SARS coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may be particularly deleterious to patients with underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) The mechanism for SARS infection is the requisite binding of the virus to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and internalization of the complex by the host cell . ACE2 degrades Ang II, a peptide with multiple actions that promote CVD, and generates Ang-(1-7 which antagonizes the effects of Ang II ."}
