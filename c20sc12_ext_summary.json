STUDY DESIGN: Primers of our in\u2010house RT\u2010PCR assays were designed to target conserved regions of the RdRP gene and E gene, selected restriction enzymes EcoRI, Tsp45I and AluI to distinguish between SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and SARS\u2010CoV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS: In this report, a 396 bp fragment of the RdRp gene and 345 bp fragment of the E gene were amplified by one\u2010step RT\u2010PCR.In this report, we summarized the six promising methods, including whole\u2010genome sequencing, real\u2010time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, nanopore target sequencing, antibody\u2010based immunoassay techniques, use of paper\u2010based biomolecular sensors, and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats\u2010Cas system\u2010based technology, which can also be deployed for the detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102.In conclusion, the present study, we successfully developed a simple method for molecular detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in differentiating with SARS\u2010CoV.
