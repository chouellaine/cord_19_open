First, nine predicted PRRSV peptides were tested by assembly of the peptide-SLA-1(*)1502 (pSLA-1(*)1502) complexes, and the crystal structure of the SLA-1(*)1502 complex with one peptide (NSP9-TMP9) was determined. The NSP9-TMP9 peptide conformation presented by pSLA-1(*)1502 is different from that of the peptides presented by the known pSLA-1(*)0401 and pSLA-3(*)hs0202 complexes. Two consecutive Pro residues make the turn between P3 and P4 of NSP9-TMP9 much sharper. The D pocket of pSLA-1(*)1502 is unique and is important for peptide binding. Next, the potential SLA-1(*)1502-restricted peptide epitopes matching four typical genetic PRRSV strains were identified based on the peptide-binding motif of SLA-1(*)1502 determined by structural analysis and alanine scanning of the NSP9-TMP9 peptide. The tetrameric complex of SLA-1(*)1502 and NSP9-TMP9 was constructed and examined. Finally, taking NSP9-TMP9 as an example, the CTL immunogenicity of the identified PRRSV peptide epitope was evaluated. The SPF swine expressing the SLA-1(*)1502 alleles were divided into three groups: modified live vaccine (MLV), MLV+NSP9-TMP9, and the blank control group. NSP9-TMP9 was determined as a PRRSV CTL epitope with strong immunogenicity by flow cytometry and IFN-\u03b3 expression. Our study developed an integrated approach to identify SLA-I-restricted CTL epitopes from various important viruses and is helpful in designing and applying effective peptide-based vaccines for swine.","publish_time":1578441600000,"author_summary":" Pan, Xiaocheng; Zhang, Nianzhi; Wei, Xiaohui;<br>Jiang, Yinan; Chen, Rong; Li, Qirun; Liang, Ruiying;<br>Zhang, Lijie; Ma, Lizhen; Xia, Chun","abstract_summary":" To investigate CTL epitope applications in<br>swine, SLA-1(*)1502-restricted peptide epitopes<br>matching porcine reproductive and respiratory<br>syndrome virus (PRRSV) strains were explored by<br>crystallography, biochemistry, and the specific pathogen-free<br>(SPF) swine experiments.

METHODS: We tested the performance of the NetMHCpan4.0 computational neural network in re-identifying 93 T-cell epitopes that had been previously independently mapped using the whole proteome IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assays in 6 HLA class I typed Ugandan individuals infected with HIV-1 subtypes A1 and D. To provide a benchmark we compared the predictions for NetMHCpan4.0 to MHCflurry1.2.0 and NetCTL1.2. RESULTS: NetMHCpan4.0 performed best correctly predicting 88 of the 93 experimentally mapped epitopes for a set length of 9-mer and matched HLA class I alleles. Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis gave an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.928. Setting NetMHCpan4.0 to predict 11-14mer length did not improve the prediction (37\u201379 of 93 peptides) with an inverse correlation between the number of predictions and length set.

METHODS: By using an immunoinformatic approach, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-specific epitopes from experimentally reported L. donovani proteins having secretory potential and increased abundance in amastigotes were screened.

RESULTS: Selected epitopes from physiologically important L. donovani proteins were found mostly conserved in L. infantum, covering theoretically more than 98% of the global population. The multi-epitope chimeric vaccine was predicted as stable, antigenic and non-allergenic. Structural analysis of vaccine-TLR4 receptor docked complex and its molecular dynamics simulation suggest sufficiently stable binding interface along with prospect of non-canonical receptor activation. Simulation dynamics of immune response following hypothetical immunization indicate active and memory B as well as CD4+ T cell generation potential, and likely chance of a more Th1 polarized response.

Rabbit antibodies against the peptides P11 and P14 (both of which are hybrids of NA and HA) recognized HA from both group 1 (H1, H2, and H5) and group 2 (H3 and H7) IAV and also recognized the purified NA protein from the viral stock (influenza A Puerto Rico\/916\/34).

In addition, chosen CTL and HTL epitopes of our vaccine showed 97.37% worldwide population coverage. Besides, disulphide engineering also improved the stability of the chimeric vaccine. Molecular docking of our vaccine protein with toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) showed binding efficiency followed by dynamics simulation for stable interaction. Furthermore, higher levels of cell-mediated immunity and rapid antigen clearance were suggested by immune simulation and repeated-exposure simulation, respectively. Finally, the optimized codons were used in in silico cloning to ensure higher expression within E. coli K12 bacterium.

Here, we present a computational model that can capture the effect of pre-existing immunity on influenza vaccine responses. The model predicts the region of the virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein targeted by antibodies after vaccination as well as the level of cross-reactivity induced by the vaccine. We tested our model by simulating a scenario similar to the 2009 pandemic vaccine and compared the results to antibody binding data obtained from human subjects vaccinated with the monovalent 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine. RESULTS: We found that both specificity and cross-reactivity of the antibodies induced by the 2009 H1N1 influenza HA protein were affected by the viral strain the individual was originally exposed. Specifically, the level of antigenic relatedness between the original exposure HA antigen and the 2009 HA protein affected antigenic-site immunodominance. Moreover, antibody cross-reactivity was increased when the individual\u2019s pre-existing immunity was specific to an HA protein antigenically distinct from the 2009 pandemic strain. Comparison of simulation data with antibody binding data from human serum samples demonstrated qualitative and quantitative similarities between the model and real-life immune responses to the 2009 vaccine. CONCLUSION: We provide a novel method to evaluate expected outcomes in antibody specificity and cross-reactivity after influenza vaccination in individuals with different influenza HA antigen exposure histories. The model produced similar outcomes as what has been previously reported in humans after receiving the 2009 influenza pandemic vaccine. Our results suggest that differences in cross-reactivity after influenza vaccination should be expected in individuals with different exposure histories.","publish_time":1592524800000,"author_summary":" Anderson, Christopher S.; Sangster, Mark Y.;<br>Yang, Hongmei; Mariani, Thomas J.; Chaudhury,<br>Sidhartha; Topham, David J.","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: In 2009, a novel influenza vaccine<br>was distributed worldwide to combat the H1N1<br>influenza \u201cswine flu\u201d pandemic.

A safe and effective vaccine is desperately needed to prevent the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2; yet, rational vaccine design efforts are currently hampered by the lack of knowledge regarding viral epitopes targeted during an immune response, and the need for more in-depth knowledge on betacoronavirus immunology. To that end, we developed a computational workflow using a series of open-source algorithms and webtools to analyze the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 and identify putative T cell and B cell epitopes. Using increasingly stringent selection criteria to select peptides with significant HLA promiscuity and predicted antigenicity, we identified 41 potential T cell epitopes (5 HLA class I, 36 HLA class II) and 6 potential B cell epitopes, respectively. Docking analysis and binding predictions demonstrated enrichment for peptide binding to HLA-B (class I) and HLA-DRB1 (class II) molecules. Overlays of predicted B cell epitopes with the structure of the viral spike (S) glycoprotein revealed that 4 of 6 epitopes were located in the receptor-binding domain of the S protein. To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively analyze all 10 (structural, non-structural and accessory) proteins from SARS-CoV-2 using predictive algorithms to identify potential targets for vaccine development. Significance Statement The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 recently emerged from China, rapidly spreading and ushering in a global pandemic. Despite intensive research efforts, our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 immunology and the proteins targeted by the immune response remains relatively limited, making it difficult to rationally design candidate vaccines. We employed a suite of bioinformatic tools, computational algorithms, and structural modeling to comprehensively analyze the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome for potential T cell and B cell epitopes. Utilizing a set of stringent selection criteria to filter peptide epitopes, we identified 41 T cell epitopes (5 HLA class I, 36 HLA class II) and 6 B cell epitopes that could serve as promising targets for peptide-based vaccine development against this emerging global pathogen.","publish_time":1589414400000,"author_summary":" Crooke, Stephen N.; Ovsyannikova, Inna G.;<br>Kennedy, Richard B.; Poland, Gregory A.","abstract_summary":" A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from<br>China in late 2019 and rapidly spread across the<br>globe, infecting millions of people and generating<br>societal disruption on a level not seen since the 1918<br>influenza pandemic.

Unfortunate no vaccine or specific treatment is available, which make it more deadly. An immunoinformatics approach has shown significant breakthrough in peptide-based epitope mapping and opens the new horizon in vaccine development. In this study, we have identified a total of 15 antigenic peptides (including T and B Cells) in the surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 which found to be 100% conserved with other SARS coronaviruses. Furthermore, the population coverage analysis has found that CD4+ T-cell peptides showed higher cumulative population coverage over to CD8+ peptides in the 16 different geographical regions in the world. Notably, only 09 out of 15 peptides (LTDEMIAQY, IRASANLAA, FGAISSVLN, VKQLSSNFG, FAMQMAYRF, FGAGAALQ, VITPGTNTS, WTAGAAAYY and QTQTNSPRRARS) that have 80% - 90% identity with experimentally identified epitopes of different organisms including SARS-CoV and this will likely be beneficial for a quick progression of the vaccine design.

The goals of this study were to use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict blueprints for designing universal vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, that contain a sufficiently broad repertoire of T-cell epitopes capable of providing coverage and protection across the global population. To help achieve these aims, we profiled the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome across the most frequent 100 HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR alleles in the human population, using host-infected cell surface antigen presentation and immunogenicity predictors from the NEC Immune Profiler suite of tools, and generated comprehensive epitope maps. We then used these epitope maps as input for a Monte Carlo simulation designed to identify statistically significant \u201cepitope hotspot\u201d regions in the virus that are most likely to be immunogenic across a broad spectrum of HLA types. We then removed epitope hotspots that shared significant homology with proteins in the human proteome to reduce the chance of inducing off-target autoimmune responses. We also analyzed the antigen presentation and immunogenic landscape of all the nonsynonymous mutations across 3400 different sequences of the virus, to identify a trend whereby SARS-COV-2 mutations are predicted to have reduced potential to be presented by host-infected cells, and consequently detected by the host immune system. A sequence conservation analysis then removed epitope hotspots that occurred in less-conserved regions of the viral proteome. Finally, we used a database of the HLA genotypes of approximately 22 000 individuals to develop a \u201cdigital twin\u201d type simulation to model how effective different combinations of hotspots would work in a diverse human population, and used the approach to identify an optimal constellation of epitopes hotspots that could provide maximum coverage in the global population. By combining the antigen presentation to the infected-host cell surface and immunogenicity predictions of the NEC Immune Profiler with a robust Monte Carlo and digital twin simulation, we have managed to profile the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome and identify a subset of epitope hotspots that could be harnessed in a vaccine formulation to provide a broad coverage across the global population.","publish_time":1587427200000,"author_summary":" Malone, Brandon; Simovski, Boris; Molin\u00e9,<br>Cl\u00e9ment; Cheng, Jun; Gheorghe, Marius; Fontenelle,<br>Hugues; Vardaxis, Ioannis; Tenn\u00f8e, Simen; Malmberg,<br>Jenny-Ann; Stratford, Richard; Clancy, Trevor","abstract_summary":" The global population is at present suffering<br>from a pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019<br>(COVID-19), caused by the novel coronavirus Severe Acute<br>Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Consistent with observations for SARS-CoV, a closely related coronavirus responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, early reports identify a protective role for both humoral and cell-mediated immunity for SARS CoV-2. Methods In this study, we leveraged HLA-I and HLA-II T cell epitope prediction tools from RECON\u00ae (Real-time Epitope Computation for ONcology), our bioinformatic pipeline that was developed using proteomic profiling of individual HLA-I and HLA-II alleles to predict rules for peptide binding to a diverse set of such alleles. We applied these binding predictors to viral genomes from the Coronaviridae family, and specifically to identify SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes. Results To test the suitability of these tools to identify viral T cell epitopes, we first validated HLA-I and HLA-II predictions on Coronaviridae family epitopes deposited in the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) database. We then use our HLA-I and HLA-II predictors to identify 11,776 HLA-I and 7,991 HLA-II candidate binding peptides across all 12 open reading frames (ORFs) of SARS-CoV-2. This extensive list of identified candidate peptides is driven by the length of the ORFs and the significant number of HLA-I and HLA-II alleles that we are able to predict (74 and 83, respectively), providing over 99% coverage for the US, European and Asian populations, for both HLA-I and HLA-II. From our SARS-CoV-2 predicted peptide-HLA-I allele pairs, 368 pairs identically matched previously reported pairs in the ViPR database, originating from other forms of coronaviruses. 320 of these pairs (89.1%) had a positive MHC-binding assay result.

This requires the integration and analysis of genetic and immunological data for SARS-CoV-2 and its homology with other human coronavirus species to understand cross-reactivity. Methods We have developed an online tool for SARS-CoV-2 research, which combines an extensive epitope mapping and prediction meta-analysis, with an updated variant database (55,944 non-synonymous mutations) based on 16,087 whole genome sequences, and an analysis of human coronavirus homology.

In this study, the structure of the key trimolecular complex pMHC-1 (aka pAime-128), which binds a peptide from canine distemper virus, was solved for the first time using giant panda as a representative species of Ursidae. The structural characteristics of the giant panda pMHC-I complex, including the unique pockets in the peptide-binding groove (PBG), were analyzed in detail. Comparing the panda pMHC-I to others in the bear family and extending the comparison to other mammals revealed distinct features. The interaction between MHC-I and \u03b22m, the features of pAime-128 involved in TCR docking and CD8 binding, the anchor sites in the PBG, and the CTL epitopes of potential viruses that infect pandas were concretely clarified. Unique features of pMHC-I viral antigen presentation in the panda were revealed by solving the three-dimensional structure of pAime-128. The distinct characteristics of pAime-128 indicate an unusual event that emerged during the evolution of the MHC system in the bear family.

It is already clear that if we follow the most likely scenario, which is similar to that used to create seasonal influenza vaccines, then we will need to develop improved vaccine formulas every year to control the spread of the new, highly mutable coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In this article, using well-known RNA viruses (HIV, influenza viruses, HCV) as examples, we consider the main successes and failures in creating primarily highly effective vaccines. The experience accumulated dealing with the biology of zoonotic RNA viruses suggests that the fight against COVID-19 will be difficult and lengthy. The most effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 will be those able to form highly effective memory cells for both humoral (memory B cells) and cellular (cross-reactive antiviral memory T cells) immunity. Unfortunately, RNA viruses constantly sweep their tracks and perhaps one of the most promising solutions in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic is the creation of 'universal' vaccines based on conservative SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (antigen-presenting) and unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (adjuvant) in the composition of the phosphorothioate backbone of single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (ODN), which can be effective for long periods of use. Here, we propose a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine based on a lasso-like phosphorothioate oligonucleotide construction containing CpG motifs and the antigen-presenting unique ACG-containing genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2. We found that CpG dinucleotides are the least rare dinucleotides in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other known human coronaviruses, and hypothesized that their higher frequency could be responsible for the unwanted increased lethality to the host, causing a \u2018cytokine storm\u2019 in people who overexpress cytokines through the activation of specific Toll-like receptors in a manner similar to TLR9-CpG ODN interactions. Interestingly, the virus strains sequenced in China (Wuhan) in February 2020 contained on average one CpG dinucleotide more in their genome than the later strains from the USA (New York) sequenced in May 2020. Obviously, during the first steps of the microevolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population, natural selection tends to select viral genomes containing fewer CpG motifs that do not trigger a strong innate immune response, so the infected person has moderate symptoms and spreads SARS-CoV-2 more readily. However, in our opinion, unmethylated CpG dinucleotides are also capable of preparing the host immune system for the coronavirus infection and should be present in SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as strong adjuvants.","publish_time":1594512000000,"author_summary":" Oberemok, V.

SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the novel coronavirus, previously dubbed 2019-nCoV, and now officially named SARS-CoV-2, are the causative agents of the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 disease outbreaks, respectively. Safe vaccines that rapidly induce potent and long-lasting virus-specific immune responses against these infectious agents are urgently needed. The coronavirus spike (S) protein, a characteristic structural component of the viral envelope, is considered a key target for vaccines for the prevention of coronavirus infection. Methods We first generated codon optimized MERS-S1 subunit vaccines fused with a foldon trimerization domain to mimic the native viral structure. In variant constructs, we engineered immune stimulants (RS09 or flagellin, as TLR4 or TLR5 agonists, respectively) into this trimeric design. We comprehensively tested the pre-clinical immunogenicity of MERS-CoV vaccines in mice when delivered subcutaneously by traditional needle injection, or intracutaneously by dissolving microneedle arrays (MNAs) by evaluating virus specific IgG antibodies in the serum of vaccinated mice by ELISA and using virus neutralization assays. Driven by the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, we utilized this strategy to rapidly develop MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines and tested their pre-clinical immunogenicity in vivo by exploiting our substantial experience with MNA MERS-CoV vaccines. Findings Here we describe the development of MNA delivered MERS-CoV vaccines and their pre-clinical immunogenicity. Specifically, MNA delivered MERS-S1 subunit vaccines elicited strong and long-lasting antigen-specific antibody responses. Building on our ongoing efforts to develop MERS-CoV vaccines, promising immunogenicity of MNA-delivered MERS-CoV vaccines, and our experience with MNA fabrication and delivery, including clinical trials, we rapidly designed and produced clinically-translatable MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines within 4 weeks of the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 sequence. Most importantly, these MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines elicited potent antigen-specific antibody responses that were evident beginning 2 weeks after immunization. Interpretation MNA delivery of coronaviruses-S1 subunit vaccines is a promising immunization strategy against coronavirus infection. Progressive scientific and technological efforts enable quicker responses to emerging pandemics. Our ongoing efforts to develop MNA-MERS-S1 subunit vaccines enabled us to rapidly design and produce MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines capable of inducing potent virus-specific antibody responses.

Through a comprehensive bioinformatic screening of potential epitopes derived from the SARS-CoV-2 sequences for HLAs commonly present in the Japanese population, we identified 2013 and 1399 possible peptide epitopes that are likely to have the high affinity (<0.5%- and 2%-rank, respectively) to HLA class I and II molecules, respectively, that may induce CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cell responses. These epitopes distributed across the structural (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins) and the nonstructural proteins (proteins corresponding to six open reading frames); however, we found several regions where high-affinity epitopes were significantly enriched. By comparing the sequences of these predicted T cell epitopes to the other coronaviruses, we identified 781 HLA-class I and 418 HLA-class II epitopes that have high homologies to SARS-CoV. To further select commonly-available epitopes that would be applicable to larger populations, we calculated population coverages based on the allele frequencies of HLA molecules, and found 2 HLA-class I epitopes covering 83.8% of the Japanese population. The findings in the current study provide us valuable information to design widely-available vaccine epitopes against SARS-CoV-2 and also provide the useful information for monitoring T-cell responses.","publish_time":1588723200000,"author_summary":" Kiyotani, Kazuma; Toyoshima, Yujiro; Nemoto,<br>Kensaku; Nakamura, Yusuke","abstract_summary":" To control and prevent the current COVID-19<br>pandemic, the development of novel vaccines is an<br>emergent issue.

Due to the rapid dissemination and the unavailability of specific therapy, there is a desperate need for vaccines to combat the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2. An in silico approach based on the available virus genome was applied to identify 19 high immunogenic B-cell epitopes and 499 human-leukocyte-antigen (HLA) restricted T-cell epitopes. Thirty multi-epitope peptide vaccines were designed by iNeo Suite, and manufactured by solid-phase synthesis. Docking analysis showed stable hydrogen bonds of epitopes with their corresponding HLA alleles. When four vaccine peptide candidates from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were selected to immunize mice, a significantly larger amount of IgG in serum as well as an increase of CD19+ cells in ILNs was observed in peptide-immunized mice compared to the control mice. The ratio of IFN-\u03b3-secreting lymphocytes in CD4+ or CD8+ cells in the peptides-immunized mice were higher than that in the control mice. There were also a larger number of IFN-\u03b3-secreting T cells in spleen in the peptides-immunized mice. This study screened antigenic B-cell and T-cell epitopes in all encoded proteins of SARS-CoV-2, and further designed multi-epitope based peptide vaccine against viral structural proteins.

In the present investigation, we characterized the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by immunoinformatics techniques to put forward potential B and T cell epitopes, followed by the use of epitopes in construction of a multi-epitope peptide vaccine construct (MEPVC). The MEPVC revealed robust host immune system simulation with high production of immunoglobulins, cytokines and interleukins. Stable conformation of the MEPVC with a representative innate immune TLR3 receptor was observed involving strong hydrophobic and hydrophilic chemical interactions, along with enhanced contribution from salt-bridges towards inter-molecular stability. Molecular dynamics simulation in aqueous milieu aided further in interpreting strong affinity of the MEPVC for TLR3. This stability is the attribute of several vital residues from both TLR3 and MEPVC as shown by radial distribution function (RDF) and a novel axial frequency distribution (AFD) analytical tool. Comprehensive binding free energies estimation was provided at the end that concluded major domination by electrostatic and minor from van der Waals. Summing all, the designed MEPVC has tremendous potential of providing protective immunity against COVID-19 and thus could be considered in experimental studies.","publish_time":1592352000000,"author_summary":" Ismail, Saba; Ahmad, Sajjad; Azam, Syed<br>Sikander","abstract_summary":" The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a<br>public health emergency of international concern and<br>thus calling for the development of effective and<br>safe therapeutics and prophylactics particularly<br>a vaccine to protect against the infection.<br>SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is an attractive candidate<br>for a vaccine, antibodies, and inhibitors<br>development because of the many roles it plays in<br>attachment, fusion and entry into the host cell.
