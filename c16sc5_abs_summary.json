ACE2 is a crucial component of renin\u2010angiotenin system (RAS) The absence of protective role of ACE2 leads to dysregulated RAS and thus acute changes under multiple pathological scenarios including SARS . This potentially shared mechanism may also be the molecular explanation for pathogenesis driven by SARS.'CoV'2 ."}
