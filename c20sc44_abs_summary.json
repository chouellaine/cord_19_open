{"cluster": 20, "subcluster": 44, "abstract_summ": " Measuring respiratory resistance and elastance as a function of time, tidal volume, respiratory rate, and respiratory rate can guide mechanical ventilation . Current measurement techniques are limited since they are assessed intermittently at non-physiological frequencies or involve specialized equipment . ZVV segments airway pressure and flow recordings into individual breaths, calculates resistance . In humans, in humans, ZVVs detected a decrease in resistance with time by 12.8% and 6.2% ."}
