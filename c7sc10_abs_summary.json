{"cluster": 7, "subcluster": 10, "abstract_summ": " Two-player win/lose games of infinite duration are involved in several disciplines including computer science and logic . We develop an algorithm for deciding the winner of the game and suggest a notion of alternating simulation . The theory is applied to Petri net games, where the strictly alternating games are in general undecidable ."}
