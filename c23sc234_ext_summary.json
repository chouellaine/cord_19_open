{"cluster": 23, "subcluster": 234, "abstract_summ": "Although based on a simple model, we hope that these insights inspire further investigations within the context of more complex and data-driven epidemiological models, and can ultimately help decision makers to improve temporal social distancing policies to mitigate the spread of epidemics.Once an epidemic outbreak has been effectively contained through non-pharmaceutical interventions, a safe protocol is required for the subsequent release of social distancing restrictions to prevent a disastrous resurgence of the infection.The model shows that epidemic growth rate is largely determined by the upper interactivity quantiles of society, implying that the most efficient methods of epidemic control are interaction capping approaches rather than overall reductions in interaction.Following a mean field approach that models individuals like molecules in a well-mixed solution, I derive a modified SIR model in which the average daily contacts between susceptible and infected population are reduced based on the known infection levels, capturing the effects of social distancing policies.This paper presents a simple theoretical model focussed on the implications of the wide range in interaction rates between individuals, both within the workplace and in the social setting.", "title_summ": "An agent based modelling approach to study lockdown efficacy for infectious disease spreadsSocial heterogeneity and the COVID-19 lockdown in a multi-group SEIR modelModeling COVID-19 on a network: super-spreaders, testing and containmentHuman agency and infection rates: implications for social distancing during epidemicsA Noncooperative Game Analysis for Controlling COVID-19 OutbreakOptimal timing for social distancing during an epidemicUniversal Features of Epidemic Models Under Social Distancing GuidelinesNash SIR: An Economic-Epidemiological Model of Strategic Behavior During a Viral EpidemicA feedback SIR (fSIR) model highlights advantages and limitations of infection-based social distancingEscaping an epidemic: Movement optimization via Minority GameGames of Social Distancing during an Epidemic: Local vs Statistical InformationIncorporating social opinion in the evolution of an epidemic spreadSocial distancing and epidemic resurgence in agent-based Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered modelsMean-Field Game Analysis of SIR Model with Social DistancingReactive Social distancing in a SIR model of epidemics such as COVID-19Heterogeneous social interactions and the COVID-19 lockdown outcome in a multi-group SEIR modelEffects of social distancing and isolation on epidemic spreading: a dynamical density functional theory modelUsing the contact network model and Metropolis-Hastings sampling to reconstruct the COVID-19 spread on the \u201cDiamond Princess\u201dSocial Distancing in Infection Control: A Lattice Model Demonstration", "title_abstract_phrases": "Heterogeneous social interactions and the COVID-19 lockdown outcome in a multi-group SEIR modelWe study variants of the SEIR model for interpreting some qualitative features of the statistics of the Covid-19 epidemic in France.Universal Features of Epidemic Models Under Social Distancing GuidelinesDifferent epidemiological models, from the classical SIR system to more sophisticated ones involving population compartments for socially distanced, quarantined, infection aware, asymptomatic infected, and other individuals, share some remarkable dynamic characteristics when contact rates are subject to periodic or one-shot changes.Reactive Social distancing in a SIR model of epidemics such as COVID-19A model of reactive social distancing in epidemics is proposed, in which the infection rate changes with the number infected.Thus, we propose that ABM approach can be used to assess various lockdown strategies that aim to prevent breakdown of medical infrastructure while accounting for realistic social network configurations specific to a local population.A feedback SIR (fSIR) model highlights advantages and limitations of infection-based social distancingTransmission rates in epidemic outbreaks vary over time depending on the societal and government response to infections and mortality data, as evidenced in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic."}
