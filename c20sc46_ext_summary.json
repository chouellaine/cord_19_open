The results show that only the use of proteinase K, without the need to perform the whole standard protocol for sample extraction and purification, can be an efficient technique for the diagnosis of COVID-19, since 91% of the samples matched the results with the standard procedure, with an average increase of 5.64 CT in the RT-qPCR.Background: Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2.URT specimens that tested negative by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR displayed higher GUSB RT-PCR cycle thresholds (CT) (P=0.070) than those testing positive (median, 30.7; range, 27.0-40.0, and median 29.7; range 25.5-36.8, respectively), this reflecting poorer cellularity.Overall, ddPCR shows superiority for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negative reports, which could be a powerful complement to the current standard RT-PCR.Real-time reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the mainstay of Covid-19 diagnosis.OBJECTIVES: This study compared the results of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR using different simple nucleic acid extraction methods on nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens.The clinical performance of RT-RAA assay was evaluated using 947 clinical samples from five institutions in four regions of China, and the approved commercial real-time fluorescent RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) kits were used for parallel detection.", "title_summ": "Comparison of Different Kits for SARS-CoV-2 RNA Extraction Marketed in BrazilCommercial stocks of SARS-CoV-2 RNA may report low concentration values, leading to artificially increased apparent sensitivity of diagnostic assaysApplication and optimization of RT-PCR in diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infectionA multiple center clinical evaluation of an ultra-fast single-tube assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNAEvaluation of simple nucleic acid extraction methods for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens during global shortage of extraction kitsQuantitative Detection and Viral Load Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in Infected PatientsHeat inactivation decreases the Qualitative Real-time RT-PCR detection rates of clinical samples with high Cycle Threshold Values in COVID-19Amplification of human \u00ce\u00b2-glucoronidase gene for appraising the accuracy of negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results in upper respiratory tract specimensAssessment of the use and quick preparation of saliva for rapid microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19Pre-treatment of the clinical sample with Proteinase K allows detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of RNA extractionddPCR: a more sensitive and accurate tool for SARS-CoV-2 detection in low viral load specimensIn-house modification and improvement of the CDC real-time PCR diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection.ddPCR: a more accurate tool for SARS-CoV-2 detection in low viral load specimens.", "title_abstract_phrases": "In this study, detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of RNA extraction has been successfully achieved through pre-treatment of the clinical sample with Proteinase K.
