{"cluster": 23, "subcluster": 276, "abstract_summ": " Modeling accurately the evolution and intervention strategies for the Covid-19 pandemic is a challenging problem . We present here an analysis of an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model that accounts for asymptomatic carriers . We find that for the same target R0target < 1, TQ is more efficient in controlling the pandemic than lockdowns that only implement SD . For TQ to be effective, it has to be based on contact tracing and the ratio of tests/day to the number of contacts of an infectious person, which would be high in densely populated regions ."}
