{"cluster": 60, "subcluster": 9, "abstract_summ": " The survival of pathogens depends on their ability to overcome host immunity, especially arthropod-borne viruses . Successful arboviruses often modify host immunity to accelerate pathogen transmission . Here we report attracted herbivore infestation on the virus-infected plants promote transmission by the associated vector . We present a scenario in which viruses dynamically respond to the presence of their vectors, suppressing host immunity ."}
