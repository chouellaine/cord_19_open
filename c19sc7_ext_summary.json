Finally, the prepared substrate has been applied for the determination of trace levels of paraquat in solution , and results show that its LOD for paraquat is 275 \u03bcg L-1 (optimum Raman band: 1646 cm-1 Raman shift), which is better than the government standard in China.", "title_summ": "Graphene vs. silica coated refractory nitrides based core-shell nanoparticles for nanoplasmonic sensingCustomised structural, optical and antibacterial characteristics of cinnamon nanoclusters produced inside organic solvent using 532 nm Q-switched Nd:YAG-pulse laser ablationGreen synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles from the leaf, stem and in vitro grown callus of Mussaenda frondosa L.: characterization and their applicationsA balsam pear-shaped CuO SERS substrate with highly chemical enhancement for pesticide residue detection.", "title_abstract_phrases": "Graphene vs. silica coated refractory nitrides based core-shell nanoparticles for nanoplasmonic sensingPlasmonic nanoparticles based on conventional metals like gold (Au) and silver (Ag) has attracted significant attention of biosensor researchers.XRD (X-ray diffraction), SEM (scanning electronic microscopy), TEM (transmission electron microscope), HRTEM (high-resolution transmission electron microscope), UV-Vis, and Raman are adopted to ensure that this balsam pear-shaped CuO with dense nanoparticle protuberance is successfully prepared.In view of the remarkable plasmonic properties of refractory nitrides (e.g., ZrN and TiN) like higher degree of spectral tuneability, growth compatibility, high melting point, inherent CMOS and biocompatibility etc., and reported high surface area, excellent bio-molecular compatibility, improvement in the speed, higher sensitivity in graphene, the present work assess the feasibility of graphene coated refractory nitrides based CSNP as an efficient refractive index sensor.The bioreduced ZnO-NPs were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet\u2013visible spectroscopy (UV\u2013Vis spectroscopy), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques.Based on this factor, a new type of spherical cinnamon nanoclusters (Cin-NCs) were synthesised using eco-friendly nanosecond pulse laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) approach."}
