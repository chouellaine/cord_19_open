Methods: We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the 2019-nCoV outbreak.Interpretation: We found that in most scenarios contact tracing and case isolation alone is unlikely to control a new outbreak of 2019-nCov within three months.Findings: While simulated outbreaks starting with only 5 initial cases, R0 of 1.5 and little transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability, the prospects of controlling an outbreak dramatically dropped with the number of initial cases, with higher R0, and with more transmission before symptom onset.FINDINGS: Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an R(0) of 1\u00b75, and 0% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when R(0) was 2\u00b75 or 3\u00b75 and with more transmission before symptom onset.The probability of control decreases with longer delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms.", "title_summ": "The role of asymptomatic class, quarantine and isolation in the transmission of COVID-19.Feasibility of controlling 2019-nCoV outbreaks by isolation of cases and contactsA model for COVID-19 with isolation, quarantine and testing as control measuresA model for COVID-19 with isolation, quarantine and testing as control measuresFeasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contactsSymptom-Based Isolation Policies: Evidence from a Mathematical Model of Outbreaks of Influenza and COVID-19Estimating the effects of asymptomatic and imported patients on COVID\u201019 epidemic using mathematical modeling", "title_abstract_phrases": "Feasibility of controlling 2019-nCoV outbreaks by isolation of cases and contactsBackground: To assess the viability of isolation and contact tracing to control onwards transmission from imported cases of 2019-nCoV.
