Systematic studies about cell behavior as a response to specific nanoparticle properties are scarce in the literature even when they are necessary for the rational design of medical nanodevices. Information in the literature shows that the physicochemical properties determine the bioactivity, biocompatibility, and safety of nanomaterials. The information available regarding the interaction and responses of cells to nanomaterials has not been analyzed and discussed in a single document. Hence, in this review, we present the latest advances about cellular responses to nanomaterials and integrate the available information into concrete considerations for the development of innovative, efficient, specific and, more importantly, safe biomedical nanodevices. We focus on how physicochemical nanoparticle properties (size, chemical surface, shape, charge, and topography) influence cell behavior in a first attempt to provide a practical guide for designing medical nanodevices, avoiding common experimental omissions that may lead to data misinterpretation. Finally, we emphasize the importance of the systematic study of nano\u2013bio interactions to acquire sufficient reproducible information that allows accurate control of cell behavior based on tuning of nanomaterial properties. This information is useful to guide the design of specific nanodevices and nanomaterials to elicit desired cell responses, like targeting, drug delivery, cell attachment, differentiation, etc, or to avoid undesired side effects.","publish_time":1585267200000,"author_summary":" Villanueva-Flores, Francisca; Castro-Lugo,<br>Andr\u00e9s; Ram\u00edrez, Octavio T; Palomares, Laura A","abstract_summary":" Biomedical applications increasingly<br>require fully characterized new nanomaterials.

In this study, 3D-printed PLA tensile samples were created with six different printer settings. Each of these six batches consisted of five sets with five or six samples. The first set remained untreated, the others were soaked in Cidex OPA or in a chlorine solution. These were applied for seven consecutive days or in 25 short cycles.

Results showed that a third of the treatments led to an increase of the median weight with a maximum of 8.3%, however, the samples with the best surface quality did not change. The median strength increase was 12.5% and the largest decrease was 8.8%. The median stiffness decreased 3.6% in one set and increased in three others up to 13.6%. When 3D printing PLA medical tools, surface porosity must be minimized to prevent transfer of disinfectants to people. The wide variability of mechanical properties due to 3D printing itself and as a consequence of disinfection must be considered when designing medical tools by selecting appropriate printer settings.

The current challenge is to translate plastic antibodies to in vivo applications for diagnosis, drug delivery, theranostic, therefore it is crucial to evaluate the effect of the biological sample complexity on the selectivity and the formation of protein corona (PCs), which ultimately dictate the fate of circulating nanoparticles. A set (n = 4) of plastic antibodies (nanoMIPs) against different proteins was prepared. Quantitative (iBAC) shotgun proteomics permitted to define the PC composition of nanoMIPs in human plasma, the relative protein abundances, the correlation between PC and the plasma dilution. NanoMIPs showed >200 proteins PC, while ~150 proteins were found on controls, suggesting the imprinting process influences the nanoparticle's structure hence the protein uptake. NanoMIPs and controls shared the 44% of the PC, but PC iBAQ values on nanoMIPs were 10-100 times higher than controls, suggesting PC\/nanoMIPs interactions were far stronger than PC\/non imprinted particles. PCs were richer in small proteins and in immunoglobulins, indicating a defensive response, while the selectivity was negatively challenged in the crowded plasma sample. SIGNIFICANCE: The formation and the composition of the protein corona (PC) is key to decide the fate of nanoparticles when in vivo, therefore there is the strong need to study the composition of the PC. To enable and to support the translation of the use of plastic antibodies (nanoMIPs), prepared by means of the molecular imprinting technique, to the clinical practice and to in vivo uses, the present work evaluates the effects of the complexity of the biological sample (plasma) on nanoMIPs composed of highly crosslinked polyacrylamide and acrylamide derivatives. Proteomic study offers an in depth insight of the protein corona formed in plasma on nanoMIPs. A set of nanoMIPs synthesized and raised to recognize either small or large proteins was tested. The selection abilities of the nanoMIPs when placed in plasma at different dilutions was studied. Quantitative shotgun proteomics allowed to define the composition of the formed protein corona (PC) enabling to detail the protein compositions, the relative abundances, its correlation to the biological sample composition and the correlation between PC and nanoMIP's imprinted template. In plasma, all the nanoMIPs gained a PC composed of more than 200 proteins. Type of protein recruited for the corona, molecular weight and abundance in the PC were studied. The PC on the nanoMIPs appeared to be driven by the protein composition of the plasma, while the template protein, towards which a nanoMIP was imprinted and that was proven to have high affinity for, did not influence the PC.","publish_time":1584403200000,"author_summary":" Capriotti, Annalaura; Piovesana, Susy;<br>Chiozzi, Riccardo Zenezini; Montone, Carmela Maria;<br>Bossi, Alessandra Maria; Lagan\u00e0, Aldo","abstract_summary":" \"Plastic antibodies\" are nano-sized<br>biomimetics prepared by the molecular imprinting<br>technology, which have the robustness of polymers, but<br>specificity and selectivity alike natural receptors<br>making them ideal for analytical uses.

Neural function was monitored using electrically-evoked auditory brainstem responses. After explant, the electrode surfaces were assessed, and cochleae examined histologically. MAIN RESULTS When measured on bench-top before and after stimulation, Pt-Ir coated electrodes had significantly lower VT impedance (p < 0.001) and significantly higher CSC (p < 0.001) and CIL (p < 0.001) compared to uncoated Pt electrodes. In vivo, the CSC and CIL of Pt-Ir were significantly higher than Pt throughout the implantation period (p = 0.047 and p < 0.001, respectively); however, the VT impedance (p = 0.3) was not. There was no difference in foreign body response between material cohorts, although cochleae implanted with coated electrodes contained small deposits of Pt-Ir. There was no evidence of increased neural loss or loss of neural function in either group. Surface examination revealed no Pt corrosion on any electrodes. SIGNIFICANCE Electrodeposited Pt-Ir electrodes demonstrated significant improvements in electrochemical performance on the bench-top and in vivo compared to uncoated Pt. Neural function and tissue response to Pt-Ir electrodes were not different from uncoated Pt, despite small deposits of Pt-Ir in the tissue capsule.

Welding processes can be used to produce pieces by AM techniques and their application has been intensified lately. Commonly, AM processes use MIG\/MG and TIG and primarily with wire as stock material. Welding offers the advantage of producing large parts in lower time and material consistency is always good, since those processes have been greatly improved. In contrast, welding workpieces, generally, result with rough surfaces and poor geometric quality, which makes them not readily acceptable for most of the common machinery applications. The present work investigates the use TIG process with metal powder as stock material to produce workpieces, which are to be post processed by machining. The AM process is based on the Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) system. A simple one-axis moving system was produced to test the whole concept. Powder was preferred since it is readily available in variety of metallic alloys. Two powder grain sizes (Gs), three travel speed values (f) and three current levels (C) were tested producing weld beads of AISI H13 on a substrate of AISI 1020 plate. Beads were assessed by measuring external dimensions and looking at their microstructures. Additional tests were performed building straight wall stacking 10 layers with the best welding parameters found with the first trials. Results indicate that materials with good internal quality could be produced when making single beads and also building straight walls. These first trials show that the proposed process can be used as a promising hybrid process, using AM (PBF-TIG) and conventional machining at the same equipment. Future work will concentrate on adapting the welding and powder bed system in a machining center to further study the process.","publish_time":1609372800000,"author_summary":" Moreira, Alcindo F.; Ribeiro, Kandice S.B.;<br>Mariani, F\u00e1bio E.; Coelho, Reginaldo T.","abstract_summary":" Abstract Additive Manufacturing (AM)<br>processes are gaining more steam in the last years, due to a<br>series of advantages, such as capability of producing<br>complex parts never possible before, low stock to be<br>removed, complex parts in exotic materials, etc.<br>However, energy efficiency, high costs and longer<br>fabrication time, could be some of the drawbacks in the<br>future.

This technology is primarily used in fabrication of micro\/nano-scale functional surfaces, geometrical features, optical and holographic components that are cut in ferrous and difficult-to-cut tooling materials with high form accuracy and surface quality. The main objective of this study was to demonstrate the positive effect of EVC motions on cutting force reduction and stabilization. For this purpose, a series of cutting trials involving the fabrication of micro V-grooves by means of the ultraprecise single point cutting (USPC) were performed. To maintain a constant level of the cutting force, an axial multi-pass cutting strategy with constant cutting area was employed. The influence and advantages brought by EVC over the conventional \u2018no-EVC\u2019 USPC scenario were initially assessed by means of the theoretical considerations of the cutting force. Following that, experimental generation of V-grooves has demonstrated that the integration of EVC kinematics with USPC motions has the ability to reduce the \u2018no-EVC\u2019 cutting forces by more than 90%, to values around 0.1 N for the main axial component. The addition of EVC motions caused a minimal decrease in surface quality whose areal roughness increased from 14 nm in the \u2018no-EVC\u2019 case to 16 nm in the \u2018with-EVC\u2019 scenario.

The segmented cutting coefficients for different ranges of cutting speed varying from 10000 rpm to 110000 rpm has been obtained as a non-liner function of chip load. Bayesian inference modelling for cutting coefficients has been carried out using the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The convergence of prior and posterior distribution has been verified using correlation and trace of samples used for sampling. The posterior distribution shows that there is a good fitting, which accurately predicts the mean of the cutting coefficients. Finally, predicted cutting coefficients have been compared with cutting coefficients obtained from the deterministic approach using least square method. The experimentally estimated cutting coefficients are found to be lying within the upper and lower limit of predicted cutting coefficients with Bayesian inference approach. The predicted cutting coefficients using Bayesian inference shows the deviation of 0.89% and 8.4% at 40000 rpm from experimentally obtained cutting coefficients for tangential and radial cutting coefficients, respectively.

In this work, torque measurements obtained from the numerical control of a milling-machine in the serial production of hydraulic valves are used to predict the concentricity as well as the diameter of drilled and reamed bores of the valves. Statistical features are determined out of the torque measurements, which are presented as time series. The prediction of the quality is achieved with the machine learning method of random forest (RF) on the basis of the extracted features. The Pearson correlation between the features and the quality characteristics as well as the learning curves of the RF method are studied. It turns out, that a strong correlation comes along with a fast decreasing learning curve of the RF but gives no information over the achievable prediction accuracy with the RF. The obtained predictions are very precise and evaluated with four statistical criteria. A mean absolute error of 17.1 \u00b5m for the concentricity and only 0.27 \u00b5m for the diameter is achieved. In addition, the coefficients of determination of the concentricity and the diameter are 96.3% and 94.1% respectively, very high.

In order to do so, four deposition paths (linear, zigzag, chessboard and contour) and beads stepover of 0.44 mm and 0.55 mm were performed on the production of Stainless Steel 316L cubes by a 5-axis laser based DED BeAM Machine Magic800 with laser spot size of 0.80 mm. The paths shown considerable influence on the variation of both final part geometry and density. Contour (spiral-like) was the path, which produced workpieces with finer form and finishing, with density and microhardness closer to the conventional AISI 316L material. The bead stepover was also found to influence the surface finishing, as larger critical valleys between adjacent beads were noticed when using the higher stepover value.","publish_time":1609372800000,"author_summary":" Ribeiro, Kandice S.B.; Mariani, F\u00e1bio E.;<br>Coelho, Reginaldo T.","abstract_summary":" Abstract The stepover of adjacent deposition<br>lines (or beads), when stacking layers to build a<br>3D-solid shape, is found to be of great importance to<br>minimize voidage and so, improving density of parts<br>produced by the Directed Energy Deposition (DED)<br>process.

Compared to the conventional process design, which is influenced by an empirical \"trial-and-error\" principle, the simulative process design offers the possibility of reducing development time and costs while at the same time improving the process understanding. A possible simulation technique to achieve these goals is the Finite Element Method (FEM). The FEM enables the calculation of the thermo-mechanical load spectrum underlying the machining process. Therefore, different input models are required. One of the most critical input models is the material model, which describes the constitutive material behavior. To determine the material model parameters, either (conventional) material tests, which require an extrapolation into the regime of metal cutting, or inverse techniques are used, where the process itself is used as a material test. Using the inverse technique, the model parameters are modified iteratively until a predefined agreement between simulations and experiments is achieved. The evaluation of the agreement bases on integral process variables, such as the cutting force, and their simulative counterparts. However, the procedure of the inverse determination requires high computational efforts and is not robust. This paper presents a novel approach to enhance the robustness of the inverse material model parameter determination from the cutting process. Orthogonal cutting tests on AISI 1045 steel have been conducted on a broaching machine tool over a range of different cutting speeds and undeformed chip thicknesses to set an experimental database. Thereby, the workpiece material was investigated in the two different heat treatments: normalized and coarse-grain annealed. The machining experiments showed differences in terms of the integral process results when comparing the two heat treatments. These results motivated for the development of a methodology capable to determine material model parameters robust and inversely from the machining process, which can be used with lower computational effort. To simulate the machining process, a Coupled-Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) model of the orthogonal cutting process has been set up. The material model parameters have been inversely determined using the Downhill-Simplex-Algorithm, which has been modified for this case. By using the Downhill-Simplex-Algorithm, it was possible to determine material model parameters within 17 iterations and achieving an average deviation between the experiment and the simulations below 10 %. Thereby, different process observables such as temperature, forces, and chip form have been used for the evaluation. Through this method, it is possible to determine material model parameters, which enable a good match between experiments and simulations with a low computational effort.","publish_time":1609372800000,"author_summary":" Bergs, Thomas; Hardt, Marvin; Schraknepper,<br>Daniel","abstract_summary":" Abstract Despite the increasing<br>digitalization of manufacturing processes in the context of<br>Industry 4.0, the process design and development of<br>machining processes poses major challenges for today\u2019s<br>manufacturing technology.

In the subsequent resistive joining process, heat is concentrated at the high-electrical-resistivity Ni-P coatings as an electric current is passed through the joint. Aluminum is melted adjacent to the Ni-P coating due to its low melting temperature, and a portion of the Ni-P coating is dissolved into the liquid aluminum and a metallurgical bond is formed as the aluminum re-solidifies. In the meantime, solid-state bonds are formed between the Ni-P coating and copper due to material interdiffusion. Consequently, no Al-Cu intermetallic compound (IMC) is generated at the joint, and the strengths of RJ joints are higher than the base metal when tested in a lap-shear configuration.","publish_time":1609372800000,"author_summary":" Wang, Hongliang; Wagner, Sean; Sekol, Ryan;<br>Chen, Nannan; Perry, Thomas; Schroth, James","abstract_summary":" Abstract Next-Generation batteries requires<br>more energy and output power due to the high demands<br>of applications to large-size vehicles, e.g.<br>SUVs and trucks.

While additive manufacturing has entered many metalcasting processes, including both expendable and permanent mold processes, this paper specifically examines the sand casting process. ExOne\u2019s development of binder jetting technology over the last 20 years has allowed designers in the sand casting field to directly 3D print sand molds for metalcasting. Use of binder jet additively manufactured sand molds allows for quicker turnaround time for testing prototypes, new gating designs, and for producing one-off parts. Additive manufacturing of sand molds for metalcasting may implement any of the same foundry sands as green sand processes, but uses a furan binder instead of the traditional mixture of bentonite clay and water. The use of a chemical binder had led to questions about the resulting dimensional capabilities and mechanical properties of the castings produced by the mold. This study investigated the dimensional tolerancing capabilities, surface finish, mechanical properties, microstructure, and defects present in identical castings made from both a traditional olivine green sand molding process and a binder jet additively manufactured silica sand molding process. It was concluded that binder jet additively manufactured sand molds are capable of either equal or better dimensional accuracy and tolerance capabilities than traditional olivine green sand molds. The olivine green sand parts had an average of approximately 1 \u03bcm better surface finish than the binder jet sand molds; however, it is likely that both the addition of sea coal to the green sand and the difference in final part color significantly affected this result. The mean hardness of the binder jet parts was 58.9 HBW with a standard deviation of 5.6 HBW, compared to the mean of the green sand parts of 47.7 HBW with a standard deviation of 7.2 HBW. The hardness findings were confirmed by the presence of a finer microstructure in the binder jet parts than the green sand parts. While both types of molds produced parts with defects, a greater variety of defects was evident in the olivine green sand molds. Porosity tended to move toward the surface of the olivine green sand parts, but was relatively evenly spread through the additively manufactured sand mold parts.","publish_time":1609372800000,"author_summary":" Hasbrouck, C.

This paper proposes a statistical digital twin of the LP process and demonstrates the applicability of amplitude distribution statistical characteristics in the experimental analysis of surface topography formation during LP process. Initially, the thermodynamic transformation of the initial surface topography is considered by means of technical cybernetics and machine learning approaches to describe two of the most critical LP process components, namely: thermodynamic melting and solidification of both solid material and surface topography. To exemplify the effective application of statistical amplitude distribution characteristics, LP experiments were conducted with two different laser powers (25 W and 100 W) on flat and ground initial surfaces and resulting surface topographies were measured. Several amplitude distribution characteristics, such as roughness average value, averaged transverse profile as a W-shape, averaged transverse roughness profile, and probability distribution function were calculated. After that, actual molten material area, volume redistribution and final surface quality were comparatively analyzed. It was shown that the proportion between two components of the LP thermodynamic transformation and surface topography is critically dependent on laser power. As such, during low-power conditions (< 25 W), surface quality is predominantly determined by the thermodynamic transformation of initial surface topography and therefore only this component can be used for statistically reliable LP process modelling and digital identification.

Electro-Fenton-BDD oxidation was more effective than electro-Fenton-Pt and anodic oxidation using Pt and BDD anodes. The efficiency of CLQ depletion by electro-Fenton-BDD oxidation raises by increasing the current density and Fe(2+) dose; however it drops with the increase of pH and CLQ concentration. CLQ depletion follows a pseudo-first order kinetics in all the experiments. The identification of CLQ degradation intermediates by chromatography methods confirms the formation of 7-chloro-4-quinolinamine, oxamic, and oxalic acids. Quantitative amounts of chlorides, nitrates, and ammonium ions are released during electro-Fenton oxidation of CLQ. The high efficiency of electro-Fenton oxidation derives from the generation of hydroxyl radicals from the catalytic decomposition of H(2)O(2) by Fe(2+) in solution, and the electrogeneration of hydroxyl and sulfates radicals and other strong oxidants (persulfates) from the oxidation of the electrolyte at the surface BDD anode.

In this study, antibacterial nanofilms with reactive oxygen species were generated by photocatalysis. To prepare these nanofilms, Ag and amorphous TiO(2) nanoparticles decorated on polydopamine (PDA) were coated on three-dimensional (3D) nanopore arrays, which was fabricated on a substrate of anodized stainless steel. All the antibacterial tests were conducted with a household flashlight, which may be considered as a practical approach for antibacterial materials. The photoelectrochemical property of the 3D Ag\/TiO(2)\/PDA nanofilm on 316L stainless steel (Ag\/TiO(2)\/PDA SS) was about 15 times higher than that of the annealed Ag\/TiO(2)\/PDA SS, and consequently, it exhibited higher antibacterial activity. The enhanced photoelectrochemical property is attributed to the successful separation of electrons (amorphous TiO(2)) and holes (Ag nanoparticles). Further, when a plate containing 3D Ag\/TiO(2)\/PDA SS was irradiated with visible light just for 10 min, it immediately destroyed the bacteria in 10(6) CFU\/mL without any bacterial colony. After five weeks, there were still no bacterial colonies in the plate corresponding to Ag\/TiO(2)\/PDA SS under visible light, while Ag\/TiO(2)\/PDA SS in dark had a negligible effect on the bacteria, i.e., the antibacterial mechanism through direct contact and ion dissolution was not efficient.

The loading behavior include variations of filtration efficiency and pressure drop and distribution of deposited aerosols in the filters all having the same fiber basis weight (3.060 gsm). Through the filtration efficiency variations of uncharged\/charged, single-\/multi-layer filters with aerosol loading, it was observed that mechanical PVDF filters had continuously increasing filtration efficiency, while PVDF electret filters had initially decreasing and subsequently increasing filtration efficiency until reaching 100% due to diminishing electrostatic effect and enhancing mechanical effect. By combining the pressure drop evolution of different filters during aerosol loading and detailed SEM images of the loaded filters, we have demonstrated that multilayer PVDF filters, especially the electret ones, could significantly slow down the pace of filter clogging (skin effect) and increase significantly the aerosol holding capacity during depth filtration. Generally, the multilayer nanofiber filters received the most aerosol deposit during depth filtration, whereas the single-layer nanofiber filters with the same basis weight of fibers received the most deposit during cake filtration. The multilayer nanofiber filters had approximately 70% aerosol deposit in the filter during depth filtration fully utilizing the full filter thickness, especially for the electret filters that had charged fibers, and only 30% deposit in the cake. On the contrary, the single-layer uncharged\/charged nanofiber filters were exactly the reverse due to persistency of the skin effect with only 30% deposit in the filter mostly located in the upstream layer, yet 70% deposit in the cake. During depth filtration, the pressure drop per added mass deposit for the multilayer electret filter was very low at 11 Pa gsm\u22121, which was at least twice below any other nanofiber filters. This was all attributed to the uniform capture of aerosols by electrostatic effect across the entire filter depth from the upstream to downstream layers of the multilayer electret filter. The above conclusion was confirmed by the detailed SEM images taken across the different filter layers for the multilayer filter configuration. The 4-layer electret nanofiber filter with a 3.060-gsm basis weight has 4 times more aerosol holding capacity than the single uncharged\/charged nanofiber filter with the same fiber basis weight in depth filtration. Based on the standpoint of highest efficiency and capacity with maximum pressure drop 800 Pa imposed on the filtration operation, the 4-layer nanofiber electret was the best among all 4 filters. It had 52% more aerosol holding capacity than the single layer uncharged nanofiber filter and 38% more capacity than the charged single-layer and the uncharged multilayer nanofiber filters.

The performance of the extracted saponin was compared with that of a commercial saponin and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The foaming properties of the saponin with carbon dioxide (CO(2)) was characterized using Teclis Foamscan instrument at room condition and 60 \u00b0C. The IFT and contact angles at room conditions and reservoir conditions were measured using KR\u0170SS Drop Shape Analyzer (DSA 25 and DSA 100) via pendant drop and sessile drop techniques respectively. The foamability of the saponin-stabilized foam was good at ambient condition and 60 \u00b0C. Moreover, the time taken for almost 100% liquid drainage was higher in saponin-stabilized foam than the SDS-stabilized foam. The optimum concentration for attaining maximum foam stability decreased from 0.4 wt% at room temperature to 0.1 wt% at 60 \u00b0C. Signifying that the quantity of the surfactant to be used in foam generation could reduce at high temperature. The isolated saponin exhibited relatively good interfacial activities individually and in synergistic interaction with silicon dioxide (SiO(2)) nanoparticles at reservoir conditions.

AcAc coatings provide the surface with greater hydrophilicity and, consequently, the formation of a hydration layer, whose thickness is related to the surface roughness. This hydration layer could explain the reduction of bacterial attachment and, consequently, the biofilm formation. Antibiofilm coatings are more successful against P. aeruginosa strains than against S. aureus ones; due to some coatings presents a smaller topography scale than the P. aeruginosa length, reducting the contact area between the bacteria and the coating, and causing a potential rupture of the cellular membrane.

The photothermal conversion and solar steam generation performances of the optimal sample (PCM(Fe\/600)) were evaluated. The adsorption properties of PCM(Fe\/600) for methylene blue (MB) were investigated. Results showed that Fe(3+) promoted the breaking of cellulose chains in WCCB, leading to the occurrence of pyrolysis of WCCB at lower temperatures and the reduction of activation energy by 76.63 kJ mol(\u22121). Char yield raised because volatile radicals were captured by FeCl(3)-derived amorphous Fe(III) species, then involved in char formation. Amorphous Fe(III) continuously converted into Fe(3)O(4) crystallites with carbonization temperature increasing from 400 to 700 \u00b0C, then \u03b1-Fe was formed at 800 \u00b0C via the carbothermal reduction of Fe(3)O(4). FeCl(3) was favorable to the formation of a developed microporous structure. Surface area significantly increased with carbonization temperature increasing from 400 to 600 \u00b0C due to the removal of volatiles. The etching of carbon by Fe(3)O(4) above 700 \u00b0C also led to the increase of surface area. PCM(Fe\/600) exhibited higher optical absorption than other samples due to its high graphite degree and porosity. It also had excellent photothermal performance; thus, solar steam yield was 1.46 times that of the pure water with the assistance of PCM(Fe\/600).
