Crossreactive analysis performed in 20 nasopharyngeal swabs confirmed a 100% of clinical specificity of the assay.A novel \u201c2019 Novel Coronavirus Detection Kit (nCoV-DK)\u201d halves detection time by eliminating the steps of RNA extraction and purification.", "title_summ": "Investigation of Compatibility of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kits Containing Different Gene Targets During COVID-19 PandemicEfficacy of a novel SARS-CoV-2 detection kit without RNA extraction and purificationA new system in qualitative RT-PCR detecting SARS-CoV-2 in biological samples: an Italian experience.COVID-19 direct assayEfficacy of a novel SARS-CoV-2 detection kit without RNA extraction and purificationEvaluation of the Aptima\u2122 Transcription-Mediated Amplification assay (Hologic\u00ae) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical specimensComparison of commercial RT-PCR diagnostic kits for COVID-19Development of RNA-based assay for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samplesComparison of commercial RT-PCR diagnostic kits for COVID-19Rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the Simplexa\u2122Development and Evaluation of a duo SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR Assay Combining Two Assays Approved by the World Health Organization Targeting the Envelope and the RNA-Dependant RNA Polymerase (RdRp) Coding Regions.", "title_abstract_phrases": "CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that the Aptima\u2122 SARS-CoV-2 TMA assay data agree well with those obtained with our routine methods and that this assay can be used to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Comparison of commercial RT-PCR diagnostic kits for COVID-19The final months of 2019 witnessed the emergence of a novel coronavirus in the human population.Finally, we used clinical samples positive for non-coronavirus respiratory viral infections (n=6) and a panel of RNA from related human coronaviruses to evaluate assay specificity.Finally, we used clinical samples positive for non-coronavirus respiratory viral infections (n = 6) and a panel of RNA from related human coronaviruses to evaluate assay specificity.Presently, the kit is currently distributed worldwideDevelopment of RNA-based assay for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samplesThe ongoing spread of pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Overall, the developed assay rapidly detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples in a cost-effective manner and would be useful in pandemic management by facilitating mass screening."}
