{"cluster": 23, "subcluster": 111, "abstract_summ": " The burden of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been geographically disproportionate . Certain weather factors and population characteristics are thought to drive transmission, but studies examining these factors are limited . Lower temperature, lower humidity, higher altitude, higher percentage of urban population, increased air travelers, and higher prevalence of obesity were strong independent predictors of national COID-19 incidence, mortality, and epidemic growth rate . Temperature at 5-7 weeks before the first reported case best predicted epidemic growth ."}
