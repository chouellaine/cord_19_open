The software, called \u2018Lesion Image Recognition and Analysis\u2019 (LIRA), employs convolutional neural networks to classify seven different pathology features, including three different lesion types from pulmonary tissues of the C3HeB\/FeJ tuberculosis mouse model.

TB detection involves extraction of complex TB manifestation features such as lung cavity, air space consolidation, endobronchial spread, and pleural effusions from chest x-rays (CXRs).

The main problem is that CNN does not consider uncertainty to classify CXRs using softmax layer.

This paper presents the solution for TB identification by using Bayesian-based convolutional neural network (B-CNN). It deals with the uncertain cases that have low discernibility among the TB and non-TB manifested CXRs. The proposed TB identification methodology based on B-CNN is evaluated on two TB benchmark datasets, i.e., Montgomery and Shenzhen. For training and testing of proposed scheme we have utilized Google Colab platform which provides NVidia Tesla K80 with 12 GB of VRAM, single core of 2.3 GHz Xeon Processor, 12 GB RAM and 320 GB of disk. B-CNN achieves 96.42% and 86.46% accuracy on both dataset, respectively as compared to the state-of-the-art machine learning and CNN approaches. Moreover, B-CNN validates its results by filtering the CXRs as confusion cases where the variance of B-CNN predicted outputs is more than a certain threshold.

However, the existing skin lesion methods are mainly relying on conventional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the performance of skin lesion recognition is far from satisfactory. Therefore, to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks of traditional methods, we propose a novel Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system, named DermoNet, based on Multi-Scale Feature Level (MSFL) blocks and Multi-Level Feature Fusion (MLFF).

Conventional (high-field) MRI scanners are very expensive to purchase, operate and maintain, which limit their use in many developing countries. This study is part of a project that aims at addressing these challenges and is carried out by teams from Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) in Uganda, Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) in the Netherlands, Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) in the Netherlands and Pennsylvania State University (PSU) in the USA. These are working on developing affordable, portable and low-field MRI scanners to diagnose children in developing countries with hydrocephalus. The challenges faced by the teams are that the low-field MRI scanners currently under development are characterized by low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and long scan times. METHODS We propose an algorithm called adaptive-size dictionary learning algorithm (AS-DLMRI) that integrates information-theoretic criteria (ITC) and Dictionary learning approaches. The result of the integration is an adaptive-size dictionary that is optimal for any input signal. AS-DLMRI may help to reduce the scan time and improve the SNR of the generated images, thereby improving the image quality. RESULTS We compared our proposed algorithm AS-DLMRI with adaptive patch-based algorithm known as DLMRI and non-adaptive CSMRI technique known as LDP. DLMRI and LDP have been used as the baseline algorithms in other related studies. The results of AS-DLMRI are consistently slightly better in terms of PSNR, SNR and HFEN than for DLMRI, and are significantly better than for LDP. Moreover, AS-DLMRI is faster than DLMRI. CONCLUSION Using a dictionary size that is appropriate to the input data could reduce the computational complexity, and also the construction quality since only dictionary atoms that are relevant to the task are included in the dictionary and are used during the reconstruction. However, AS-DLMRI did not completely remove noise during the experiments with the noisy phantom. Our next step in our research is to integrate our proposed algorithm with an image denoising function.","publish_time":1593388800000,"author_summary":" Ahishakiye, Emmanuel; Van Gijzen, Martin<br>Bastiaan; Tumwiine, Julius; Obungoloch, Johnes","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)<br>is a safe non-invasive and nonionizing medical<br>imaging modality that is used to visualize the<br>structure of human anatomy.

The motion estimate is used to adapt the radiation beam to the current anatomy, yielding a more conformal dose distribution. As the MR acquisition is the largest component of latency, deep learning (DL) may reduce the total latency by enabling much higher undersampling factors compared to conventional reconstruction and motion estimation methods. The benefit of DL on image reconstruction and motion estimation was investigated for obtaining accurate deformation vector fields (DVFs) with high temporal resolution and minimal latency.Methods: 2D cine MRI acquired at 1.5T from 135 abdominal cancer patients were retrospectively included in this study. Undersampled radial golden angle acquisitions were retrospectively simulated. DVFs were computed using different combinations of conventional- and DL-based methods for image reconstruction and motion estimation, allowing a comparison of four approaches to achieve real-time motion estimation. The four approaches were evaluated based on the end-point-error and root-mean-square error compared to a ground-truth optical flow estimate on fully-sampled images, the structural similarity (SSIM) after registration and time necessary to acquire k-space, reconstruct an image and estimate motion.Results: The lowest DVF error and highest SSIM were obtained using conventional methods up to R\u226410. For undersampling factors R>10, the lowest DVF error and highest SSIM were obtained using conventional image reconstruction and DL-based motion estimation. We have found that, with this combination, accurate DVFs can be obtained up to R=25 with an average root-mean-square error up to 1 millimeter and an SSIM greater than 0.8 after registration, taking 60 milliseconds.Conclusion: High-quality 2D DVFs from highly undersampled k-space can be obtained with a high temporal resolution with conventional image reconstruction and a deep learning-based motion estimation approach for real-time adaptive MRI-guided radiotherapy.","publish_time":1589414400000,"author_summary":" Terpstra, Maarten Lennart; Maspero, Matteo;<br>D'Agata, Federico; Stemkens, Bjorn; Intven, Martijn P<br>W; Lagendijk, Jan J W; Van den Berg, Cornelis A T;<br>Tijssen, Rob H N","abstract_summary":" Purpose: To enable magnetic resonance imaging<br>(MRI)-guided radiotherapy with real-time adaptation,<br>motion must be quickly estimated with low latency.

The current global standard used in diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected cases is the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Although the RT-PCR remains the standard reference for diagnosis purposes, it is a time-consuming and expensive test, and moreover, it usually suffers from high rates of false-negatives. Several early works have reported that the sensitivity of the chest Computed Tomography (CT) and the chest X-ray imaging are noticeably greater than that of the RT-PCR test at the initial representations of the disease, making them great candidates for developing new and sophisticated methodologies for analysis and classification of COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we establish the use of a rapid, non-invasive and cost-effective X-ray-based method as a key diagnosis and screening tool for COVID-19 at early and intermediate stages of the disease. To this end, we develop a novel and sophisticated deep learning-based signal and image processing technique as well as classification methodology for analyzing X-ray images specific to COVID-19 disease. Specifically, we consider a semi-supervised learning methodology based on AutoEncoders to first extract the infected legions in chest X-ray manifestation of COVID-19 and other Pneumonia-like diseases (as well as healthy cases). Then, we utilize this highly-tailored deep architecture to extract the relevant features specific to each class (i.e., healthy, non-COVID pneumonia, and COVID-19) and train a powerful yet efficient classifier to perform the task of automatic diagnosis. Furthermore, the semi-supervised nature of the proposed framework enables us to efficiently exploit the limited available dataset on COVID-19 while exploiting the vast amount of available X-ray dataset for healthy and non-COVID classes. Moreover, such a semi-supervised approach does not require an expert-annotated lesion area for each class. Our numerical investigations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for COVID-19 identification while employing approximately ten times fewer training parameters as compared to other existing methodologies for classification of the COVID-19 from X-ray images (facilitating efficient training in a limited data regime). We further develop explainable artificial intelligence tools that can explain the diagnosis by using attribution maps while providing an indispensable tool for the radiologist in triage state.

The Diagnosis Module (DM) is proposed for early and accurately detecting the patients with COVID 19 and distinguish it from other viral pneumonias using COVID19 signs obtained from CT scans. The DM model, uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a Deep learning technique for segmentation, can process hundreds of CT images in seconds to speed up diagnosis of COVID19 and contribute in its containment. In addition, some countries have no ability to provide all patients with the treatment and intensive care services, so it will be mandatory to give treatment to only responding patients. In this context, the Prediction Module (PM) is proposed for predicting the ability of the patient to respond to treatment based on different factors e.g. age, infection stage, respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and the treatment regimens.

In this paper, we first build a clean and segmented CT dataset called Clean-CC-CCII by fixing the errors and removing some noises in a large CT scan dataset CC-CCII with three classes: novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), common pneumonia (CP), and normal controls (Normal). After cleaning, our dataset consists of a total of 340,190 slices of 3,993 scans from 2,698 patients. Then we benchmark and compare the performance of a series of state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D and 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results show that 3D CNNs outperform 2D CNNs in general. With extensive effort of hyperparameter tuning, we find that the 3D CNN model DenseNet3D121 achieves the highest accuracy of 88.63% (F1-score is 88.14% and AUC is 0.940), and another 3D CNN model ResNet3D34 achieves the best AUC of 0.959 (accuracy is 87.83% and F1-score is 86.04%).

Chest X- ray is an important diagnostic test to assess the lung for the damaging effects of COVID-19. Many other microbial pathogens can also cause damage to lungs leading to pneumonia but there are certain radiological features which can favor the diagnosis of pneumonia caused by COVID-19. With the rising number of cases of COVID-19, it would be imperative to develop computer programs which may assist the health professionals in the prevailing scenario. Materials & Methods : A total of two hundred and seventy eight (278) images of chest X-rays have been assessed by applying ResNet-50 convolutional neural network architectures in the present study. The digital images were acquired from the public repositories provided by University of Montreal and National Institutes of Health. These digital images of Chest X-rays were divided into three groups labeled as normal, pneumonia and COVID- 19. The third group contains digital images of chest X-rays of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection while the second group contains images of lung with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. Results : The radiological images included in the data set are 89 images of lungs with COVID-19 infection, 93 images of lungs without any radiological abnormality and 96 images of patient with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. In this data set, 80% of the images were employed for training, and 20% for testing. A pre-trained (on ImageNet data set) ResNet-50 architecture was used to diagnose the cases of COVID-19 infections on lung Xray images.

At the first stage, this network runs an image processing algorithm to discard those CT images that inside the lung is not properly visible in them. This helps to reduce the number of images that shall be identified as normal or COVID-19, so it reduces the processing time. Also, running this algorithm makes the deep network at the next stage to analyze only the proper images and thus reduces false detections. At the next stage, we propose a modified version of ResNet50V2 that is enhanced by a feature pyramid network for classifying the selected CT images into COVID-19 or normal.

We introduce ai-corona, a radiologist-assistant deep learning framework for COVID-19 infection diagnosis using the chest CT scans. Method: Our dataset comprises 2121 cases of axial spiral chest CT scans in three classes; COVID-19 abnormal, non COVID-19 abnormal, and normal, from which 1764 cases were used for training and 357 cases for validation. The training set was annotated using the reports of two experienced radiologists. The COVID-19 abnormal class validation set was annotated using the general consensus of a collective of criteria that indicate COVID-19 infection. Moreover, the validation sets for the non COVID-19 abnormal and the normal classes were annotated by a different experienced radiologist. ai-corona constitutes a CNN-based feature extractor conjoined with an average pooling and a fully-connected layer to classify a given chest CT scan into the three aforementioned classes. Results: We compare the diagnosis performance of ai-corona, radiologists, and model-assisted radiologists for six combinations of distinguishing between the three mentioned classes, including COVID-19 abnormal vs. others, COVID-19 abnormal vs. normal, COVID-19 abnormal vs. non COVID-19 abnormal, non COVID-19 abnormal vs. others, normal vs. others, and normal vs. abnormal. ai-corona achieves an AUC score of 0.989 (95% CI: 0.984, 0.994), 0.997 (95% CI: 0.995, 0.999), 0.986 (95% CI: 0.981, 0.991), 0.959 (95% CI: 0.944, 0.974), 0.978 (95% CI: 0.968, 0.988), and 0.961 (95% CI: 0.951, 0.971) in each combination, respectively.

This is achieved from chest X-ray (CXR) images shedding light on the preprocessing task considered to be very useful for enhancing the COVID-19 fingerprints.

Data collected form 60 pairs of sequential CXRs from 40 COVID patients (mean age +\/- standard deviation: 56 +\/- 13 years; 23 men, 10 women, seven not reported) and were categorized in three categories: Worse, Stable, or Improved on the basis of radiological evolution ascertained from images and reports. Receiver operating characteristic analyses, Mann-Whitney tests were performed. Results - On patients from the CheXnet dataset, the area under ROC curves ranged from 0.71 to 0.93 for seven imaging features and one diagnosis. Deep learning features between Worse and Improved outcome categories were significantly different for three radiological signs and one diagnostic (Consolidation, Lung Lesion, Pleural Effusion and Pneumonia; all P < 0.05). Features from the first CXR of each pair could correctly predict the outcome category between Worse and Improved cases with 82.7% accuracy.

In addition to outperforming other deep models on the same task in the recent literature, with an attained accuracy of 99.4%, we also present comparative analysis for multi-modal learning against learning from X-ray scans alone. The second and the third stages of the proposed pipeline complement one another in dealing with different types of infection manifestations. The former features a convolutional neural network architecture for recognizing three types of manifestations, while the latter transfers learning from another knowledge domain, namely, pulmonary nodule segmentation in CT scans, to produce binary masks for segmenting the regions corresponding to these manifestations. Our proposed pipeline also features specialized streams in which multiple deep models are trained separately to segment specific types of infection manifestations, and we show the significant impact that this framework has on various performance metrics. We evaluate the proposed models on widely adopted datasets, and we demonstrate an increase of approximately 4% and 7% for dice coefficient and mean intersection-over-union (mIoU), respectively, while achieving 60% reduction in computational time, compared to the recent literature.","publish_time":1593129600000,"author_summary":" El-bana, S.; Al-Kabbany, A.; Sharkas, M.","abstract_summary":" We are concerned with the challenge of<br>coronavirus disease (COVID-19) detection in chest X-ray<br>and Computed Tomography (CT) scans, and the<br>classification and segmentation of related infection<br>manifestations.

The performance of lung abnormality segmentation was examined using Dice coefficient, while the assessment of disease severity and the disease progression were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the Cohen's kappa statistic, respectively.

Methods and Findings: We collected 1,065 CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases (325 images) along with those previously diagnosed with typical viral pneumonia (740 images). We modified the Inception transfer-learning model to establish the algorithm, followed by internal and external validation. The internal validation achieved a total accuracy of 89.5% with specificity of 0.88 and sensitivity of 0.87.

MATERIALS AND METHODS In this retrospective study, the proposed method takes as input a non-contrasted chest CT and segments the lesions, lungs, and lobes in three dimensions, based on a dataset of 9749 chest CT volumes. The method outputs two combined measures of the severity of lung and lobe involvement, quantifying both the extent of COVID-19 abnormalities and presence of high opacities, based on deep learning and deep reinforcement learning. The first measure of (PO, PHO) is global, while the second of (LSS, LHOS) is lobewise. Evaluation of the algorithm is reported on CTs of 200 participants (100 COVID-19 confirmed patients and 100 healthy controls) from institutions from Canada, Europe and the United States collected between 2002-Present (April, 2020). Ground truth is established by manual annotations of lesions, lungs, and lobes. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to compare the prediction to the ground truth.

It includes several image pre-processing algorithms to remove diaphragms, normalize image contrast-to-noise ratio, and generate three input images, then links to a transfer learning based convolutional neural network (a VGG16 based CNN model) to classify chest X-ray images into three classes of COVID-19 infected pneumonia, other community-acquired pneumonia and normal (non-pneumonia) cases. To this purpose, a publicly available dataset of 8,474 chest X-ray images is used, which includes 415 confirmed COVID-19 infected pneumonia, 5,179 community-acquired pneumonia, and 2,880 non-pneumonia cases. The dataset is divided into two subsets with 90% and 10% of images in each subset to train and test the CNN-based CAD scheme. The testing results achieve 94.0% of overall accuracy in classifying three classes and 98.6% accuracy in detecting Covid-19 infected cases. Thus, the study demonstrates the feasibility of developing a CAD scheme of chest X-ray images and providing radiologists useful decision-making supporting tools in detecting and diagnosis of COVID-19 infected pneumonia.","publish_time":1591833600000,"author_summary":" Heidari, Morteza; Mirniaharikandehei,<br>Seyedehnafiseh; Khuzani, Abolfazl Zargari; Danala,<br>Gopichandh; Qiu, Yuchen; Electrical, Bin Zheng School of;<br>Engineering, Computer; Oklahoma, University of; USA,<br>Norman; Electrical, Department of; Cruz, University<br>of California Santa; Cruz, Santa; USA,","abstract_summary":" As the rapid spread of coronavirus disease<br>(COVID-19) worldwide, chest X-ray radiography has also<br>been used to detect COVID-19 infected pneumonia and<br>assess its severity or monitor its prognosis in the<br>hospitals due to its low cost, low radiation dose, and wide<br>accessibility.

If the anomaly score produced by the anomaly detection module is large enough or the confidence score estimated by the confidence prediction module is small enough, we accept the input as an anomaly case (i.e., viral pneumonia). The major advantage of our approach over binary classification is that we avoid modeling individual viral pneumonia classes explicitly and treat all known viral pneumonia cases as anomalies to reinforce the one-class model.

The learned knowledge is transferred and fine-tuned to improve performance and generalization in the related task of classifying CXRs as normal, showing bacterial pneumonia, or COVID-19-viral abnormalities. The best performing models are iteratively pruned to reduce complexity and improve memory efficiency. The predictions of the best-performing pruned models are combined through different ensemble strategies to improve classification performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the weighted average of the best-performing pruned models significantly improves performance resulting in an accuracy of 99.01% and area under the curve of 0.9972 in detecting COVID-19 findings on CXRs. The combined use of modality-specific knowledge transfer, iterative model pruning, and ensemble learning resulted in improved predictions. We expect that this model can be quickly adopted for COVID-19 screening using chest radiographs.","publish_time":1586995200000,"author_summary":" Rajaraman, Sivaramakrishnan; Siegelman,<br>Jen; Alderson, Philip O.; Folio, Lucas S.; Folio,<br>Les R.; Antani, Sameer K.","abstract_summary":" We demonstrate use of iteratively pruned deep<br>learning model ensembles for detecting pulmonary<br>manifestation of COVID-19 with chest X-rays.

Then, the relationship among different cases is formulated by a hypergraph structure, with each case represented as a vertex in the hypergraph. The uncertainty of each vertex is further computed with an uncertainty score measurement and used as a weight in the hypergraph.

As the number of affected patients increase rapidly, manual severity assessment becomes a labor-intensive task, and may lead to delayed treatment. Purpose: Using machine learning method to realize automatic severity assessment (non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 based on chest CT images, and to explore the severity-related features from the resulting assessment model. Materials and Method: Chest CT images of 176 patients (age 45.3$\\pm$16.5 years, 96 male and 80 female) with confirmed COVID-19 are used, from which 63 quantitative features, e.g., the infection volume\/ratio of the whole lung and the volume of ground-glass opacity (GGO) regions, are calculated. A random forest (RF) model is trained to assess the severity (non-severe or severe) based on quantitative features. Importance of each quantitative feature, which reflects the correlation to the severity of COVID-19, is calculated from the RF model. Results: Using three-fold cross validation, the RF model shows promising results, i.e., 0.933 of true positive rate, 0.745 of true negative rate, 0.875 of accuracy, and 0.91 of area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The resulting importance of quantitative features shows that the volume and its ratio (with respect to the whole lung volume) of ground glass opacity (GGO) regions are highly related to the severity of COVID-19, and the quantitative features calculated from the right lung are more related to the severity assessment than those of the left lung. Conclusion: The RF based model can achieve automatic severity assessment (non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 infection, and the performance is promising.

A key challenge for preventing and controlling COVID-19 is how to quickly, widely, and effectively implement the test for the disease, because testing is the first step to break the chains of transmission. To assist the diagnosis of the disease, radiology imaging is used to complement the screening process and triage patients into different risk levels. Deep learning methods have taken a more active role in automatically detecting COVID-19 disease in chest x-ray images, as witnessed in many recent works. Most of these works first train a CNN on an existing large-scale chest x-ray image dataset and then fine-tune it with a COVID-19 dataset at a much smaller scale. However, direct transfer across datasets from different domains may lead to poor performance due to visual domain shift. Also, the small scale of the COVID-19 dataset on the target domain can make the training fall into the overfitting trap. To solve all these crucial problems and fully exploit the available large-scale chest x-ray image dataset, we formulate the problem of COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification in a semi-supervised open set domain adaptation setting, through which we are motivated to reduce the domain shift and avoid overfitting when training on a very small dataset of COVID-19. In addressing this formulated problem, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Open set Domain Adversarial network (SODA), which is able to align the data distributions across different domains in a general domain space and also in a common subspace of source and target data. In our experiments, SODA achieves a leading classification performance compared with recent state-of-the-art models, as well as effectively separating COVID-19 with common pneumonia.","publish_time":1590105600000,"author_summary":" Zhou, Jieli; Jing, Baoyu; Wang, Zeya","abstract_summary":" The global pandemic of COVID-19 has infected<br>millions of people since its first outbreak in last<br>December.

In this paper, we report our solution, discriminative cost-sensitive learning (DCSL), which should be the choice if the clinical needs the assisted screening of COVID-19 from chest X-rays. DCSL combines both advantages from fine-grained classification and cost-sensitive learning. Firstly, DCSL develops a conditional center loss that learns deep discriminative representation. Secondly, DCSL establishes score-level cost-sensitive learning that can adaptively enlarge the cost of misclassifying COVID-19 examples into other classes. DCSL is so flexible that it can apply in any deep neural network. We collected a large-scale multi-class dataset comprised of 2,239 chest X-ray examples: 239 examples from confirmed COVID-19 cases, 1,000 examples with confirmed bacterial or viral pneumonia cases, and 1,000 examples of healthy people.

A metric-based approach for classification of COVID-19 used interpretable features, relying on logistic regression and random forests. A deep learning-based classifier differentiated COVID-19 based on 3D features extracted directly from CT intensities and from the probability distribution of airspace opacities. Results: Most discriminative features of COVID-19 are percentage of airspace opacity, ground glass opacities, consolidations, and peripheral and basal opacities, which coincide with the typical characterization of COVID-19 in the literature. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering compares the distribution of these features across COVID-19 and control cohorts. The metrics-based classifier achieved AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of respectively 0.85, 0.81, and 0.77. The DL-based classifier achieved AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of respectively 0.90, 0.86, and 0.81. Most of ambiguity comes from non-COVID-19 pneumonia with manifestations that overlap with COVID-19, as well as COVID-19 cases in early stages.

However, it is often challenging to accurately assess the severity of this disease in CT images, due to variable infection regions in the lungs, similar imaging biomarkers, and large inter-case variations. To this end, we propose a synergistic learning framework for automated severity assessment of COVID-19 in 3D CT images, by jointly performing lung lobe segmentation and multi-instance classification. Considering that only a few infection regions in a CT image are related to the severity assessment, we first represent each input image by a bag that contains a set of 2D image patches (with each cropped from a specific slice). A multi-task multi-instance deep network (called M$^2$UNet) is then developed to assess the severity of COVID-19 patients and also segment the lung lobe simultaneously. Our M$^2$UNet consists of a patch-level encoder, a segmentation sub-network for lung lobe segmentation, and a classification sub-network for severity assessment (with a unique hierarchical multi-instance learning strategy). Here, the context information provided by segmentation can be implicitly employed to improve the performance of severity assessment.

This labeling scheme allows annotators to label a pixel in a likely infected region, only taking 1-3 seconds, as opposed to 10-15 seconds to segment a region. Conventionally, segmentation models train on point-level annotations using the cross-entropy loss function on these labels. However, these models often suffer from low precision. Thus, we propose a consistency-based (CB) loss function that encourages the output predictions to be consistent with spatial transformations of the input images. The experiments on 3 open-source COVID-19 datasets show that this loss function yields significant improvement over conventional point-level loss functions and almost matches the performance of models trained with full supervision with much less human effort.

The development of computer-aided systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs) has been advanced, to rapidly and accurately detect COVID-19 cases, because the need for expert radiologists, who are limited in number, forms a bottleneck for the screening. However, so far, the vulnerability of DNN-based systems has been poorly evaluated, although DNNs are vulnerable to a single perturbation, called universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), which can induce DNN failure in most classification tasks. Thus, we focus on representative DNN models for detecting COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images and evaluate their vulnerability to UAPs generated using simple iterative algorithms. We consider nontargeted UAPs, which cause a task failure resulting in an input being assigned an incorrect label, and targeted UAPs, which cause the DNN to classify an input into a specific class. The results demonstrate that the models are vulnerable to nontargeted and targeted UAPs, even in case of small UAPs. In particular, 2% norm of the UPAs to the average norm of an image in the image dataset achieves>85% and>90% success rates for the nontargeted and targeted attacks, respectively. Due to the nontargeted UAPs, the DNN models judge most chest X-ray images as COVID-19 cases. The targeted UAPs make the DNN models classify most chest X-ray images into a given target class. The results indicate that careful consideration is required in practical applications of DNNs to COVID-19 diagnosis; in particular, they emphasize the need for strategies to address security concerns.

To address this, motivated by that typical pneumonia has similar characteristics with COVID-19 and many pneumonia datasets are publicly available, we propose to conduct domain knowledge adaptation from typical pneumonia to COVID-19. There are two main challenges: 1) the discrepancy of data distributions between domains; 2) the task difference between the diagnosis of typical pneumonia and COVID-19. To address them, we propose a new deep domain adaptation method for COVID-19 diagnosis, namely COVID-DA. Specifically, we alleviate the domain discrepancy via feature adversarial adaptation and handle the task difference issue via a novel classifier separation scheme. In this way, COVID-DA is able to diagnose COVID-19 effectively with only a small number of COVID-19 annotations.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the semantic segmentation of medical chest X-ray images with only image-level class labels as supervision. We improve the disease localization accuracy by combining three approaches as consecutive steps. First, we generate pseudo segmentation labels of abnormal regions in the training images through a supervised classification model enhanced with a regularization procedure. The obtained activation maps are then post-processed and propagated into a second classification model-Inter-pixel Relation Network, which improves the boundaries between different object classes. Finally, the resulting pseudo-labels are used to train a proposed fully supervised segmentation model. We analyze the robustness of the presented method and test its performance on two distinct datasets: PASCAL VOC 2012 and SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax. We achieve significant results in the segmentation on both datasets using only image-level annotations. We show that this approach is applicable to chest X-rays for detecting an anomalous volume of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall.

The goal of this work is to build open source and open access datasets and present an accurate Convolutional Neural Network framework for differentiating COVID19 cases from other pneumonia cases. Our work utilizes state of the art training techniques including progressive resizing, cyclical learning rate finding and discriminative learning rates to training fast and accurate residual neural networks. Using these techniques, we showed the state of the art results on the open-access COVID-19 dataset. This work presents a 3-step technique to fine-tune a pre-trained ResNet-50 architecture to improve model performance and reduce training time. We call it COVIDResNet. This is achieved through progressively re-sizing of input images to 128x128x3, 224x224x3, and 229x229x3 pixels and fine-tuning the network at each stage. This approach along with the automatic learning rate selection enabled us to achieve the state of the art accuracy of 96.23% (on all the classes) on the COVIDx dataset with only 41 epochs. This work presented a computationally efficient and highly accurate model for multi-class classification of three different infection types from along with Normal individuals. This model can help in the early screening of COVID19 cases and help reduce the burden on healthcare systems.","publish_time":1585612800000,"author_summary":" Farooq, Muhammad; Hafeez, Abdul","abstract_summary":" In the last few months, the novel COVID19<br>pandemic has spread all over the world.

Now, it becomes a Coronavirus outbreak around the world, the number of infected people and deaths are increasing rapidly every day according to the updated reports of the World Health Organization (WHO). Therefore, the aim of this article is to introduce a new deep learning framework; namely COVIDX-Net to assist radiologists to automatically diagnose COVID-19 in X-ray images.

The COVIDX-Net includes seven different architectures of deep convolutional neural network models, such as modified Visual Geometry Group Network (VGG19) and the second version of Google MobileNet. Each deep neural network model is able to analyze the normalized intensities of the X-ray image to classify the patient status either negative or positive COVID-19 case.

The classification performance of the computer algorithms and the radiologists was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the nonparametric approaches with multiplicity adjustments when necessary. RESULTS: One of the considered models showed non-trivial, but moderate diagnostic ability overall (AUC of 0.70 with 99% CI 0.56\u20130.85). This model allowed for the identification of 8\u201350% of CAP patients with only 2% of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Professional or automated interpretation of CT exams has a moderately low ability to distinguish between COVID-19 and CAP cases. However, the automated image analysis is promising for targeted decision-making due to being able to accurately identify a sizable subsect of non-COVID-19 cases. KEY POINTS: \u2022 Both human experts and artificial intelligent models were used to classify the CT scans. \u2022 ROC analysis and the nonparametric approaches were used to analyze the performance of the radiologists and computer algorithms. \u2022 Unique image features or patterns may not exist for reliably distinguishing all COVID-19 from CAP; however, there may be imaging markers that can identify a sizable subset of non-COVID-19 cases.","publish_time":1590624000000,"author_summary":" Pu, Jiantao; Leader, Joseph; Bandos, Andriy;<br>Shi, Junli; Du, Pang; Yu, Juezhao; Yang, Bohan; Ke,<br>Shi; Guo, Youmin; Field, Jessica B.; Fuhrman, Carl;<br>Wilson, David; Sciurba, Frank; Jin, Chenwang","abstract_summary":" OBJECTIVE: To define the uniqueness of chest CT<br>infiltrative features associated with COVID-19 image<br>characteristics as potential diagnostic biomarkers.

According to a multinational consensus statement from the Fleischner Society, computed tomography (CT) is a relevant screening tool due to its higher sensitivity for detecting early pneumonic changes. However, physicians are extremely occupied fighting COVID-19 in this era of worldwide crisis. Thus, it is crucial to accelerate the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic tool to support physicians. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to rapidly develop an AI technique to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia in CT images and differentiate it from non\u2013COVID-19 pneumonia and nonpneumonia diseases. METHODS: A simple 2D deep learning framework, named the fast-track COVID-19 classification network (FCONet), was developed to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia based on a single chest CT image. FCONet was developed by transfer learning using one of four state-of-the-art pretrained deep learning models (VGG16, ResNet-50, Inception-v3, or Xception) as a backbone. For training and testing of FCONet, we collected 3993 chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, other pneumonia, and nonpneumonia diseases from Wonkwang University Hospital, Chonnam National University Hospital, and the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology public database. These CT images were split into a training set and a testing set at a ratio of 8:2. For the testing data set, the diagnostic performance of the four pretrained FCONet models to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia was compared. In addition, we tested the FCONet models on an external testing data set extracted from embedded low-quality chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia in recently published papers. RESULTS: Among the four pretrained models of FCONet, ResNet-50 showed excellent diagnostic performance (sensitivity 99.58%, specificity 100.00%, and accuracy 99.87%) and outperformed the other three pretrained models in the testing data set. In the additional external testing data set using low-quality CT images, the detection accuracy of the ResNet-50 model was the highest (96.97%), followed by Xception, Inception-v3, and VGG16 (90.71%, 89.38%, and 87.12%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: FCONet, a simple 2D deep learning framework based on a single chest CT image, provides excellent diagnostic performance in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia.

The implementation of auxiliary diagnosis support algorithm for medical text data faces challenges with interpretability and creditability. The improvement of clinical diagnostic techniques means not only the improvement of diagnostic accuracy but also the further study of diagnostic basis. Traditional research methods for diagnostic markers often require a large amount of time and economic costs. Research objects are often dozens of samples, and it is, therefore, difficult to synthesize large amounts of data. Therefore, the comprehensiveness and reliability of traditional methods have yet to be improved. Therefore, the establishment of a model that can automatically diagnose diseases and automatically provide a diagnostic basis at the same time has a positive effect on the improvement of medical diagnostic techniques. METHODS: Here, we established an auxiliary diagnostic tool based on attention deep learning algorithm to diagnostic hyperlipemia and automatically predict the corresponding diagnostic markers using hematological parameters. In this paper, we not only demonstrated the ability of the proposed model to automatically diagnose diseases using text-based medical data, such as physiological parameters, but also demonstrated its ability to forecast disease diagnostic markers. Human physiological parameters are used as input to the model, and the doctor\u2019s diagnosis results as an output. Through the attention layer, the degree of attention of the model to different physiological parameters can be obtained, that is, the model provides a diagnostic basis. RESULTS: It achieved 94% ACC, 97.48% AUC, 96% sensitivity and 92% specificity with the test dataset. All the above samples are drawn from clinical practice. Moreover, the model predicted the diagnostic markers of hyperlipidemia by the attention mechanism, and the results were fully agreeable to the golden criteria. DISCUSSION: The auxiliary diagnosis system proposed in this paper not only achieves the accurate and robust performance, and can be used for the preliminary diagnosis of patients, but also showing its great potential to discover new diagnostic markers. Therefore, it not only can improve the efficiency of clinical diagnosis but also shorten the research period of researching a diagnosis basis to an extent.

METHODS: We developed a deep learning model to improve accuracy of reported cases and to precisely predict the disease from chest X-ray scans. Our model relied on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect structural abnormalities and disease categorization that were keys to uncovering hidden patterns. To do so, a transfer learning approach was deployed to perform detections from the chest anterior-posterior radiographs of patients. We used publicly available datasets to achieve this. RESULTS: Our results offer very high accuracy (96.3%) and loss (0.151 binary cross-entropy) using the public dataset consisting of patients from different countries worldwide.

METHODS: A deep learning algorithm consisted of lesion detection, segmentation, and location was trained and validated in 14,435 participants with chest CT images and definite pathogen diagnosis. The algorithm was tested in a non-overlapping dataset of 96 confirmed COVID-19 patients in three hospitals across China during the outbreak. Quantitative detection performance of the model was compared with three radiological residents with two experienced radiologists\u2019 reading reports as reference standard by assessing the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. RESULTS: Of 96 patients, 88 had pneumonia lesions on CT images and 8 had no abnormities on CT images. For per-patient basis, the algorithm showed superior sensitivity of 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95, 1.00) and F1 score of 0.97 in detecting lesions from CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia patients. While for per-lung lobe basis, the algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 0.96 (95% CI 0.94, 0.98) and a slightly inferior F1 score of 0.86. The median volume of lesions calculated by algorithm was 40.10 cm(3). An average running speed of 20.3 s \u00b1 5.8 per case demonstrated the algorithm was much faster than the residents in assessing CT images (all p < 0.017).

Assertions in the literature suggest that respiratory disorders due to COVID-19 commonly present with pneumonia-like symptoms which are radiologically confirmed as opacities. Radiology serves as an adjunct to the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test for confirmation and evaluating disease progression. While computed tomography (CT) imaging is more specific than chest X-rays (CXR), its use is limited due to cross-contamination concerns. CXR imaging is commonly used in high-demand situations, placing a significant burden on radiology services. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) has been suggested to alleviate this burden. However, there is a dearth of sufficient training data for developing image-based AI tools. We propose increasing training data for recognizing COVID-19 pneumonia opacities using weakly labeled data augmentation. This follows from a hypothesis that the COVID-19 manifestation would be similar to that caused by other viral pathogens affecting the lungs. We expand the training data distribution for supervised learning through the use of weakly labeled CXR images, automatically pooled from publicly available pneumonia datasets, to classify them into those with bacterial or viral pneumonia opacities. Next, we use these selected images in a stage-wise, strategic approach to train convolutional neural network-based algorithms and compare against those trained with non-augmented data. Weakly labeled data augmentation expands the learned feature space in an attempt to encompass variability in unseen test distributions, enhance inter-class discrimination, and reduce the generalization error. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that simple weakly labeled data augmentation (Acc: 0.5555 and Acc: 0.6536) is better than baseline non-augmented training (Acc: 0.2885 and Acc: 0.5028) in identifying COVID-19 manifestations as viral pneumonia. Interestingly, adding COVID-19 CXRs to simple weakly labeled augmented training data significantly improves the performance (Acc: 0.7095 and Acc: 0.8889), suggesting that COVID-19, though viral in origin, creates a uniquely different presentation in CXRs compared with other viral pneumonia manifestations.","publish_time":1590796800000,"author_summary":" Rajaraman, Sivaramakrishnan; Antani, Sameer","abstract_summary":" The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome<br>coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic resulting<br>in over 2.7 million infected individuals and over<br>190,000 deaths and growing.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective and multi-center study, a deep learning model, COVID-19 detection neural network (COVNet), was developed to extract visual features from volumetric chest CT exams for the detection of COVID-19. Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other non-pneumonia CT exams were included to test the robustness of the model. The datasets were collected from 6 hospitals between August 2016 and February 2020.

RESULTS: The collected dataset consisted of 4356 chest CT exams from 3,322 patients. The average age is 49\u00b115 years and there were slightly more male patients than female (1838 vs 1484; p-value=0.29). The per-exam sensitivity and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the independent test set was 114 of 127 (90% [95% CI: 83%, 94%]) and 294 of 307 (96% [95% CI: 93%, 98%]), respectively, with an AUC of 0.96 (p-value<0.001).

A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based architecture, named as CovXNet, is proposed that utilizes depthwise convolution with varying dilation rates for efficiently extracting diversified features from chest X-rays. Since the chest X-ray images corresponding to COVID-19 caused pneumonia and other traditional pneumonias have significant similarities, at first, a large number of chest X-rays corresponding to normal and (viral\/bacterial) pneumonia patients are used to train the proposed CovXNet. Learning of this initial training phase is transferred with some additional fine-tuning layers that are further trained with a smaller number of chest X-rays corresponding to COVID-19 and other pneumonia patients. In the proposed method, different forms of CovXNets are designed and trained with X-ray images of various resolutions and for further optimization of their predictions, a stacking algorithm is employed. Finally, a gradient-based discriminative localization is integrated to distinguish the abnormal regions of X-ray images referring to different types of pneumonia.

Early diagnosis is crucial for correct treatment in order to possibly reduce the stress in the healthcare system. The standard image diagnosis tests for pneumonia are chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scan. Although CT scan is the gold standard, CXR are still useful because it is cheaper, faster and more widespread. This study aims to identify pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from other types and also healthy lungs using only CXR images. Methods:In order to achieve the objectives, we have proposed a classification schema considering the following perspectives: i) a multi-class classification; ii) hierarchical classification, since pneumonia can be structured as a hierarchy. Given the natural data imbalance in this domain, we also proposed the use of resampling algorithms in the schema in order to re-balance the classes distribution. We observed that, texture is one of the main visual attributes of CXR images, our classification schema extract features using some well-known texture descriptors and also using a pre-trained CNN model. We also explored early and late fusion techniques in the schema in order to leverage the strength of multiple texture descriptors and base classifiers at once. To evaluate the approach, we composed a database, named RYDLS-20, containing CXR images of pneumonia caused by different pathogens as well as CXR images of healthy lungs. The classes distribution follows a real-world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than others. Results:The proposed approach tested in RYDLS-20 achieved a macro-avg F1-Score of 0.65 using a multi-class approach and a F1-Score of 0.89 for the COVID-19 identification in the hierarchical classification scenario. Conclusions:As far as we know, the top identification rate obtained in this paper is the best nominal rate obtained for COVID-19 identification in an unbalanced environment with more than three classes. We must also highlight the novel proposed hierarchical classification approach for this task, which considers the types of pneumonia caused by the different pathogens and lead us to the best COVID-19 recognition rate obtained here.","publish_time":1588896000000,"author_summary":" Pereira, Rodolfo M.; Bertolini, Diego;<br>Teixeira, Lucas O.; Silla, Carlos N.; Costa, Yandre M.G.","abstract_summary":" Background and Objective:The COVID-19 can<br>cause severe pneumonia and is estimated to have a high<br>impact on the healthcare system.

PURPOSE: To establish and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI) system in differentiating COVID-19 and other pneumonia on chest CT and assess radiologist performance without and with AI assistance. METHODS: 521 patients with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 and abnormal chest CT findings were retrospectively identified from ten hospitals from January 2020 to April 2020. 665 patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia and definite evidence of pneumonia on chest CT were retrospectively selected from three hospitals between 2017 and 2019. To classify COVID-19 versus other pneumonia for each patient, abnormal CT slices were input into the EfficientNet B4 deep neural network architecture after lung segmentation, followed by two-layer fully-connected neural network to pool slices together. Our final cohort of 1,186 patients (132,583 CT slices) was divided into training, validation and test sets in a 7:2:1 and equal ratio. Independent testing was performed by evaluating model performance on separate hospitals. Studies were blindly reviewed by six radiologists without and then with AI assistance. RESULTS: Our final model achieved a test accuracy of 96% (95% CI: 90-98%), sensitivity 95% (95% CI: 83-100%) and specificity of 96% (95% CI: 88-99%) with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) AUC of 0.95 and Precision-Recall (PR) AUC of 0.90. On independent testing, our model achieved an accuracy of 87% (95% CI: 82-90%), sensitivity of 89% (95% CI: 81-94%) and specificity of 86% (95% CI: 80-90%) with ROC AUC of 0.90 and PR AUC of 0.87. Assisted by the models\u2019 probabilities, the radiologists achieved a higher average test accuracy (90% vs. 85%, \u0394=5, p<0.001), sensitivity (88% vs. 79%, \u0394=9, p<0.001) and specificity (91% vs. 88%, \u0394=3, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: AI assistance improved radiologists' performance in distinguishing COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT.","publish_time":1587945600000,"author_summary":" Bai, Harrison X.; Wang, Robin; Xiong, Zeng;<br>Hsieh, Ben; Chang, Ken; Halsey, Kasey; Tran, Thi My<br>Linh; Choi, Ji Whae; Wang, Dong-Cui; Shi, Lin-Bo;<br>Mei, Ji; Jiang, Xiao-Long; Pan, Ian; Zeng, Qiu-Hua;<br>Hu, Ping-Feng; Li, Yi-Hui; Fu, Fei-Xian; Huang,<br>Raymond Y.; Sebro, Ronnie; Yu, Qi-Zhi; Atalay, Michael<br>K.; Liao, Wei-Hua","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: COVID-19 and pneumonia of other<br>etiology share similar CT characteristics,<br>contributing to the challenges in differentiating them with<br>high accuracy.
