{"cluster": 35, "subcluster": 12, "abstract_summ": " Genetic variability in ACE2 may be one factor that mediates the broad-spectrum severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcomes . Three ACE2 variants predicted to strongly inhibit or abolish the S-protein ACE2 interaction altogether (p.Glu37Lys, p.Gly352Val and p.Asp355Asn) and one that is predicted to promote the interaction . The prevalence of the strongly protective variants is estimated between 12-70 per 100,000 population but there is the possibility of higher prevalence in local populations ."}
