Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and designates it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).", "title_summ": "When Darkness Becomes a Ray of Light in the Dark Times: Understanding the COVID-19 via the Comparative Analysis of the Dark Proteomes of SARS-CoV-2, Human SARS and Bat SARS-Like CoronavirusesEvolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: A global health emergencyNovel coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a pandemic (epidemiology, pathogenesis and potential therapeutics)Systematic Comparison of Two Animal-to-Human Transmitted Human Coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoVAsymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease, and pneumonia due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): Facts and mythsFrom SARS to COVID-19: A previously unknown SARS- related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) of pandemic potential infecting humans \u2013 Call for a One Health approachSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2): A global pandemic and treatments strategiesCOVID-19: what has been learned and to be learned about the novel coronavirus diseaseThe global emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in humanSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): Emergence, History, Basic and Clinical AspectsSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2): An overview of viral structure and host responseSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19): The epidemic and the challengesInsights into the Recent 2019 Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Light of Past Human Coronavirus OutbreaksComparative review of respiratory diseases caused by coronaviruses and influenza A viruses during epidemic seasonSevere acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: The species and its viruses \u2013 a statement of the Coronavirus Study GroupA Comprehensive Review of Manifestations of Novel Coronaviruses in the Context of Deadly COVID-19 Global PandemicThe species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2Coronavirus (COVID-19): A Review of Clinical Features, Diagnosis, and TreatmentClinical, molecular and epidemiological characterization of the SARS-CoV2 virus and the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a comprehensive literature reviewSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2): An UpdateHuman Coronavirus Infections\u2014Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and SARS-CoV-2COVID-19 infection: Origin, transmission, and characteristics of human coronavirusesEpidemiology, virology, and clinical features of severe acute respiratory syndrome -coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2;
