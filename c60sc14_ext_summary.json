These findings provide important insights into RNA synthesis by coronavirus polymerase and indicate a well adaptation of COVID-19 virus towards humans with relatively lower body temperatures than the natural bat hosts.COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus that has several enzymes that could be targeted by antivirals including a 2\u2019-O RNA methyltransferase (MTase) that is involved in the viral RNA cap formation; an essential process for RNA stability.Here, we describe the near-atomic resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex, consisting of nsp12 catalytic subunit and nsp7-nsp8 cofactors.Here, we describe the near-atomic resolution structure of its core polymerase complex, consisting of nsp12 catalytic subunit and nsp7-nsp8 cofactors.Biochemical studies reveal reduced activity of the core polymerase complex and lower thermostability of individual subunits of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to that of SARS-CoV.
