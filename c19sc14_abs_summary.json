{"cluster": 19, "subcluster": 14, "abstract_summ": " We present a proof of concept for a spectrally selective thermal mid-IR source based on nanopatterned graphene (NPG) with a typical mobility of CVD-grown graphene . The localized surface plasmons (LSPs) on the NPG sheet allow for the control and tuning of the thermal emission spectrum ."}
