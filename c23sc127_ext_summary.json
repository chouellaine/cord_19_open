This virus-load function can be used as input to higher level models for the physiological effects of a virus infection, for models for tissue damage, and to develop treatment strategies.This article presents a mathematical infection model that is designed to estimate the course of coronavirus infection in Germany for several days in advance: How many people become ill or die, what is the temporal development?A mathematical model is proposed to assess the effects of a vaccine on the time evolution of a coronavirus outbreak.A mathematical model is proposed for quantitative description of the outbreak of novel coronavirus COVID-19 in China.", "title_summ": "On the corona infection model with contact restrictionApplying chemical reaction transition theory to predict the latent transmission dynamics of coronavirus outbreak in ChinaUsing Feedback on Symptomatic Infections to Contain the Coronavirus Epidemic: Insight from a SPIR ModelA simple mathematical model for the evolution of the corona virusA mathematical model for the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreakFirst attempts to model the dynamics of the Coronavirus outbreak 2020Understanding the fate of corona virus transmission using a simple modelA Mathematical Description of the Dynamics of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): A Case Study of BrazilEffects of information-dependent vaccination behavior on coronavirus outbreak: insights from a SIRI modelPrediction of the coronavirus epidemic prevalence inquarantine conditions based on an approximate calculation modelNonlinear Markov Chain Modelling of the Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) PandemicA Standard Virus Load FunctionA simple mathematical model for Coronavirus (COVID-19)A dynamic model for Covid-19 in Brazil.", "title_abstract_phrases": "A mathematical model for the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreakA mathematical model is proposed for quantitative description of the outbreak of novel coronavirus COVID-19 in China.On the corona infection model with contact restrictionThis article presents a mathematical infection model that is designed to estimate the course of coronavirus infection in Germany for several days in advance: How many people become ill or die, what is the temporal development?Further, we compare the virus load function to an established {it target model} of virus dynamics as presented by A.
