Treatment of bone metastases currently focusses on symptom relief and prevention and treatment of skeletal complications. However, there remains a need for further treatment options for patients with bone metastases. Combining systemic therapy with a bone-targeted agent, such as radium-223, may provide an effective treatment with minimal additional side effects. METHODS\/DESIGN: CARBON is a UK-based, open-label, multi-centre study which comprises an initial safety phase to establish the feasibility and safety of combining radium-223 given on a 6-weekly schedule in combination with orally administered capecitabine followed by a randomised extension phase to further characterise the safety profile and provide preliminary estimation of efficacy. DISCUSSION: The CARBON study is important as the results will be the first to assess radium-223 with chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether (1) a relationship among the inflammatory status of labrum and synovium collected from patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) would exist; and (2) to investigate the associations among the histopathological features of joint tissues, the pre-operative symptoms and the post-operative outcomes after arthroscopic surgery. METHODS: Joint tissues from 21 patients undergoing hip arthroscopy for FAI were collected and their histological and immunohistochemical features were correlated with clinical parameters. RESULTS: Synovial mononuclear cell infiltration was observed in 25% of FAI patients, inversely correlated with the hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome score (HOOS) pain and function subscales and with the absolute and relative change in total HOOS. All the labral samples showed some pattern of degeneration and 67% of the samples showed calcium deposits. The total labral score was associated with increased CD68 positive cells in the synovium. The presence of labral calcifications, along with the chondral damage worsened the HOOS post-op symptoms (adjusted R-square = 0.76 p = 0.0001).

Previously, an international multicenter study reported that this procedure was not inferior to conventional open surgery. However, thoracoscopic surgery is a highly difficult operation for surgeons and anesthesiologists; as a result, the safety and efficacy of the surgery is still under debate. Considering these circumstances, the purpose of this study was to analyze the results of single-center thoracoscopic surgery and to compare the outcomes relative to the patient\u2019s weight at the time of surgery. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients with EA\/TEF who underwent thoracoscopic surgery in a single center between October 2008 and February 2017. RESULTS: In total, 41 cases of thoracoscopic repair of EA\/TEF were performed. Upon subgrouping by over and under 2000 g of body weight at the time of operation, 34 were found to be over 2000 g and seven were under 2000 g. Intraoperative factors and events were not significantly different between the two groups. Additionally, most of the postoperative outcomes, including the rate of postoperative leakage and strictures, showed no difference. On the other hand, the under 2000 g group had more gastroesophageal reflux requiring fundoplication than did the heavier group (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this center\u2019s thoracoscopic repair of EA\/TEF were not inferior to other centers\u2019 outcomes. Additionally, the intraoperative and postoperative outcomes were similar despite differences in weight at operation. Therefore, thoracoscopic repair might be a feasible surgical option for infants weighing less than 2000 g when performed by a surgeon and anesthesiologist team who are experienced in pediatric thoracoscopic surgery.","publish_time":1587513600000,"author_summary":" Son, Joonhyuk; Jang, Yerang; Kim, Wontae; Lee,<br>Sanghoon; Jeong, Ji Seon; Lee, Suk-Koo; Seo, Jeong-Meen","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: Since Rothenberg first performed<br>thoracoscopic repair for esophageal atresia with distal<br>tracheoesophageal fistula (EA\/TEF) successfully in 2000,<br>thoracoscopic repair has achieved status as a routine<br>procedure worldwide.

Variables included demographics, fracture morphology, neurologic exam, indication for surgery, length of hospitalization, and mortality. Regression analyses were used to report outcomes and predictors of nonoperative treatment. RESULTS: 270 patients met inclusion criteria, of which 145 were managed nonoperatively. Demographics between groups were similar. The nonoperative group was young (mean = 35.5 years) and primarily male (n = 125, 86%). Nonoperative patients had 7.39 times the odds of death (p = 0.003).

The 2016 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) guidelines states that enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) forms an integral part of Perioperative Surgical Home (PSH) and is now recommended to use a multimodal opioid-sparing approach for management of postoperative pain. As such, dexmedetomidine is now being used as part of ERAS protocols along with regional nerve blocks and other medications, to create a satisfactory postoperative outcome with reduced opioid consumption in the Post anesthesia care unit (PACU). RECENT FINDINGS: Dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha(2) agonist, possesses analgesic effects and has a different mechanism of action when compared with opioids. When dexmedetomidine is initiated at the end of a procedure, it has a better hemodynamic stability and pain response than ropivacaine. Dexmedetomidine can be used as an adjuvant in epidurals with local anesthetic sparing effects. Its use during nerve blocks results in reduced postoperative pain. Also, local infiltration of IV dexmedetomidine is associated with earlier discharge from PACU.

Despite advancing technology of surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF), treatment and indications remain controversial. Lack of displacement is often cited as a reason for non-operative management. The purpose was to examine RF patterns hypothesizing RF become more displaced over time. METHODS: Retrospective review of all RF patients from 2016\u20132017 at our institution. Patients with initial chest CT (CT1) followed by repeat CT (CT2) within 84 days were included. Basic demographics were obtained. Primary outcomes included RF displacement in millimeters (mm) between CT1 and CT2 in three planes (AP = anterior\/posterior, O = overlap\/gap, and SI = superior\/inferior). Displacement was calculated by subtracting CT1 fracture displacement from CT2 displacement for each rib. Given anatomic and clinical characteristics, ribs were grouped (1\u20132, 3\u20136, 7\u201310, 11\u201312), averaged, and analyzed for displacement. Secondary outcome included number of missed RF on CT1. Non-parametric sign test and paired t test were used for analysis. Significance was set at p < 0.002. RESULTS: 78 of 477 patients with RF on CT1 had CT2 during the study period: primarily male (76%) and age 55.8 \u00b1 20.1 with blunt mechanism of injury (99%). Median Injury Severity Score was 21 (IQR, 13\u201327) with Chest Abbreviated Injury Score of 3 (IQR, 3\u20134). Median time between CT1 and CT2 was 6 days (IQR, 3\u201312). Missed RF rate for CT1 was 10.1% (p = 0.11). Average fracture displacement was significantly increased for all rib groupings except 11\u201312 in all planes (p < 0.002). CONCLUSION: RF become more displaced over time.

However, many biocompatibility issues remain to be a concern for hernioplasty, with chronic pain being the most notable post-operative complication. Oxidative stress appears to be a major factor in the development of those complications. Lack of material inertness in vivo and oxidative environment formed by inflammatory cells result in both mesh deterioration and slowed healing process. In a pilot in vivo study, we prepared and characterized polypropylene hernia meshes with vitamin E (\u03b1-tocopherol)-a potent antioxidant. The results of that study supported the use of vitamin E as potential coating to alleviate post-surgical inflammation, but the pilot nature of the study yielded limited statistical data. The purpose of this study was to verify the observed trend of the pilot study statistically. METHODS: In this work, we conducted a 5-animal experiment where we have implanted vitamin E-coated and uncoated control meshes into the abdominal walls of rabbits. Histology of the mesh-adjacent tissues and electron microscopy of the explanted mesh surface were conducted to characterize host tissue response to the implanted meshes. RESULTS: As expected, modified meshes exhibited reduced foreign body reaction, as evidenced by histological scores for fatty infiltrates, macrophages, neovascularization, and collagen organization, as well as by the surface deterioration of the meshes.

Opioids are thought to contribute to the mechanism of bowel dysfunction. We tested if methylnaltrexone, a pure peripheral mu-opioid receptor antagonist, could reverse opioid-induced constipation. METHODS: The MOTION trial is a multi-centre, double blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial to investigate whether methylnaltrexone alleviates opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in critical care patients. Eligibility criteria included adult ICU patients who were mechanically ventilated, receiving opioids and were constipated (had not opened bowels for a minimum 48 h) despite prior administration of regular laxatives as per local bowel management protocol. The primary outcome was time to significant rescue-free laxation. Secondary outcomes included gastric residual volume, tolerance of enteral feeds, requirement for rescue laxatives, requirement for prokinetics, average number of bowel movements per day, escalation of opioid dose due to antagonism\/reversal of analgesia, incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, incidence of diarrhoea and Clostridium difficile infection and finally 28 day, ICU and hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients were enrolled and randomized (41 to methylnaltrexone and 43 to placebo). The baseline demographic characteristics of the two groups were generally well balanced. There was no significant difference in time to rescue-free laxation between the groups (Hazard ratio 1.42, 95% CI 0.82\u20132.46, p = 0.22). There were no significant differences in the majority of secondary outcomes, particularly days 1\u20133. However, during days 4\u201328, there were fewer median number of bowel movements per day in the methylnaltrexone group, (p = 0.01) and a greater incidence of diarrhoea in the placebo group (p = 0.02). There was a marked difference in mortality between the groups, with ten deaths in the methylnaltrexone group and two in the placebo group during days 4\u201328 (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: We found no evidence to support the addition of methylnaltrexone to regular laxatives for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in critically ill patients; however, the confidence interval was wide and a clinically important difference cannot be excluded.

We performed a prospective randomized study to determine if the ORR of SBRT + IL-2 was greater than IL-2 monotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma. METHODS: Patients with MM who had adequate physiological reserve for IL-2 and at least one site suitable for SBRT were eligible. There was a 1:1 randomization to SBRT + IL-2 or IL-2 monotherapy. Patients received one or two doses of SBRT (20 Gy per fraction) with the last dose administered 3 days before starting the first cycle of IL-2. IL-2 (600,000 IU per kg via intravenous bolus infusion) was given every 8 hours for a maximum of 14 doses with a second cycle after a 2-week rest. Responding patients received up to six IL-2 cycles. Patients assigned to IL-2 monotherapy who exhibited progression of melanoma after cycle 2 were allowed to crossover and receive SBRT and additional IL-2. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 criteria were applied to non-irradiated lesions for response assessment. RESULTS: 44 patients were included in the analysis. The ORR in the SBRT + IL-2 group was 54%: 21% complete response (CR), 33% partial response (PR), 21% stable disease (SD) and 25% progressive disease (PD). The ORR in patients receiving IL-2 monotherapy was 35%: 15% CR, 20% PR, 25% SD and 40% PD. Seven patients assigned to IL-2 subsequently received SBRT + IL-2. One CR and two PRs were observed in the crossover group. There was no difference in progression-free or overall survival (OS). At 5 years the OS was 26% in the SBRT + IL-2 group and 25% in the IL-2 monotherapy group. The disease control rate (DCR) was higher in the SBRT + IL-2 group (75% vs 60%, p=0.34). CONCLUSIONS: SBRT + IL-2 induced more objective responses with a higher DCR compared to IL-2 monotherapy in MM. IL-2 monotherapy resulted in a significantly higher ORR than anticipated.

Diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) has become increasingly utilized for the diagnosis and management of both blunt and penetrating injuries. OBJECTIVE: While the safety and feasibility of laparoscopy has been established for penetrating thoracoabdominal trauma, it remains a controversial tool for other injury patterns due to the concern for complications and missed injuries. We sought to examine the role of laparoscopy for the initial management of traumatic injuries at our urban Level 1 trauma center. METHODS: All trauma patients who underwent DL for blunt or penetrating trauma between 2009 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, indications for DL, injuries identified, rate of conversion to open surgery, and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 316 patients were included in the cohort. The mean age was 34.9 years old (\u00b1 13.7), mean GCS 14 (\u00b1 3), and median ISS 10 (4\u201318). A total of 110\/316 patients (35%) sustained blunt injury and 206\/316 patients (65%) sustained penetrating injury. Indications for DL included evaluation for peritoneal violation (152\/316, 48%), free fluid without evidence of solid organ injury (52\/316, 16%), evaluation of bowel injury (42\/316, 13%), and evaluation for diaphragmatic injury (35\/316, 11%). Of all DLs, 178\/316 (56%) were negative for injury requiring intervention, which was 58% of blunt cases and 55% of penetrating cases. There were no missed injuries noted. Average hospital length of stay was significantly shorter for patients that underwent DL vs conversion to open exploration (2.2 days vs. 4.5 days, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In this single institution, retrospective study, the high volume of cases appears to show that DL is a reliable tool for detecting injury and avoiding potential negative or non-therapeutic laparotomies. However, when injuries were present, the high rate of conversion to open exploration suggests that its utility for therapeutic intervention warrants further study.","publish_time":1591228800000,"author_summary":" Koganti, Deepika; Hazen, Benjamin J.; Dente,<br>Christopher J.; Nguyen, Jonathan; Gelbard, Rondi B.","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: The role of minimally invasive<br>surgery in trauma has continued to evolve over the past<br>20 years.

DESIGN: A cost\u2013utility analysis from a societal and healthcare perspective alongside a double-blinded, parallel group, placebo, multicentre trial. SETTING: Hospital outpatient clinics at six hospitals in Norway. The main results from the AIM study showed a small effect in back-related disability in favour of the antibiotics group, and slightly larger in those with type I Modic changes, but this effect was below the pre-defined threshold for clinically relevant effect. PARTICIPANTS: 180 patients with chronic LBP, previous disc herniation and Modic changes type I (n=118) or type II (n=62) were randomised to antibiotic treatment (n=89) or placebo-control (n=91). INTERVENTIONS: Oral treatment with either 750 mg amoxicillin or placebo three times daily for 100 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by EuroQoL-5D over 12 months and costs for healthcare and productivity loss measured in Euro (\u20ac1=NOK 10), in the intention-to-treat population. Cost\u2013utility was expressed in incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Mean (SD) total cost was \u20ac21 046 (20 105) in the amoxicillin group and \u20ac19 076 (19 356) in the placebo group, mean difference \u20ac1970 (95% CI; \u22123835 to 7774). Cost per QALY gained was \u20ac24 625. In those with type I Modic changes, the amoxicillin group had higher healthcare consumption than the placebo group, resulting in \u20ac39 425 per QALY gained. Given these ICERs and a willingness-to-pay threshold of \u20ac27 500 (NOK 275 000), the probability of amoxicillin being cost-effective was 51%. Even when the willingness-to-pay threshold increased to \u20ac55 000, the probability of amoxicillin being cost-effective was never higher than 53%. CONCLUSIONS: Amoxicillin treatment showed no evidence of being cost-effective for people with chronic LBP and Modic changes during 1-year follow-up.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of a database collected over a 7-year period. Patients with primary ventral hernias were included and a cumulative sum analysis(CUSUM) was used to create learning curves for three subsets of operative times. A risk-adjusted CUSUM (RA-CUSUM) accounted for repair quality based on peritoneal flap completeness. The flap was considered as incomplete when peritoneal gaps were unable to be closed. RESULTS: 105 patients undergoing rTAPP-VHR were included. Learning curves were created for skin-to-skin, console, and off-console times. Patients were divided into three phases. In terms of skin-to-skin times, both phase 2&3 had a mean 11 min shorter than that of phase 1 (p = 0.0498, p = 0.0245, respectively), with a steady decrease after forty-six cases. An incomplete peritoneal flap was noted in 25\/36 patients in phase 1, as compared to 5\/24 and 5\/45 patients in phase 2&3, respectively. When risk-adjusted for peritoneal flap completeness, gradually decreasing skin-to-skin times were observed after sixty-one cases. In terms of off-console times, the mean across three phases was 14 min, with marked improvement after forty-three cases. CONCLUSIONS: Forty-six cases were needed to achieve steadily decreasing operative times. We can assume that ensuring good-quality repairs, through maintenance of peritoneal flap integrity, was gradually improved after sixty-one cases. Moreover, familiarization with port placements and robotic docking was accomplished after forty-three cases.","publish_time":1591142400000,"author_summary":" Kudsi, O.

METHODS: From January 2009 to February 2018, 100 patients with gastric varices caused by portal hypertension who underwent Sp + Dev (n = 45) or BRTO (n = 55) were included. Overall survival (OS) and the rebleeding rate were calculated using the inverse probability of a treatment weighting-adjusted log-rank test. Independent risk factors were identified by Cox regression analysis. Changes in liver function and adverse events after the procedures were analyzed. RESULTS: Patients in the Sp + Dev group tended to have lower platelet counts than those in the BRTO group, but liver function did not differ between these groups. The 5-year OS rates for the Sp + Dev and BRTO groups were 73.4 and 50.0% (p = 0.005), respectively. There were no significant differences in rebleeding rates between the two groups.

Operative, angioembolic, and nonoperative strategies are management options, although the association between management strategy and outcomes is unknown. This study endeavored to define the epidemiology, management strategy, and outcomes after penetrating injuries to the vertebral artery presenting to trauma centers nationwide. METHODS: Patients with veterbral artery injuries were identified from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) (2016\u20132017) using ICD-10-CM codes. Only those with penetrating mechanisms of injury were included in the study. Transferred patients were excluded. Study groups were defined by management strategy (Operative management, OM; angioembolization, AE; and nonoperative management, NOM). Patient demographics, injury characteristics, and outcomes were compared between groups using univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression was used to examine independent risk factors for mortality and stroke. RESULTS: Penetrating injuries to the vertebral artery were rare (n = 476, < 1% of NTDB patient population). Median age was 28 [IQR 21\u201337] years and 81% (n = 385) of patients were male. Interpersonal violence was the most common injury intent (n = 374, 79%). Most patients were managed with NOM (n = 409, 86%), with AE and OM utilized less frequently (8% and 6%, respectively). Stab wounds were the most frequent mechanism of injury among patients managed with OM (62%), while gunshot wounds were most common among patients managed with NOM (84%) or AE (79%). Multivariate analysis of risk factors for stroke revealed only associated carotid artery injury (OR 4.236, 95% CI 1.284\u201313.970, p = 0.018) and AE (OR 6.342, 95% CI 1.417\u201328.399, p = 0.016) were independent predictors. Independent risk factors for mortality were advanced age (OR 1.026, 95% CI 1.001\u20131.052, p = 0.044); elevated ISS (OR 1.030, 95% CI 1.008\u20131.052, p = 0.006); and associated traumatic brain injury (OR 3.020, 95% CI 1.333\u20136.843, p = 0.008).

CONCLUSIONS: Vertebral artery injuries after penetrating mechanisms are infrequent in the United States. Patients with these injuries tend to be young adult men who were injured by gunshot wounds as a result of interpersonal violence. The majority of these injuries were managed nonoperatively, with operative intervention required most commonly for patients injured by stab wounds. Risk factors for both stroke and mortality were principally due to patient factors and associated injuries. Increased risk of stroke among patients managed with angioembolization will need to be further investigated with future study to determine if this risk is imparted from the management strategy itself or from underlying injury characteristics.","publish_time":1592697600000,"author_summary":" Schellenberg, Morgan; Owattanapanich,<br>Natthida; Cowan, Shaun; Strickland, Matt; Lewis,<br>Meghan; Clark, Damon H.; Inaba, Kenji","abstract_summary":" PURPOSE: Penetrating injuries to the<br>vertebral artery are rare and incompletely studied.<br>Operative, angioembolic, and nonoperative strategies<br>are management options, although the association<br>between management strategy and outcomes is unknown.<br>This study endeavored to define the epidemiology,<br>management strategy, and outcomes after penetrating<br>injuries to the vertebral artery presenting to trauma<br>centers nationwide.

PURPOSE: To examine pharmacological management strategies designed to prevent and\/or treat IWS from opioids and\/or benzodiazepines in critically ill neonates, children and adults. METHODS: We included non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSI) and randomised controlled trials (RCTs), reporting on interventions to prevent or manage IWS in critically ill neonatal, paediatric and adult patients. Database searching included: PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane databases, TRIP, CMA Infobase and NICE evidence. Additional grey literature was examined. Study selection and data extraction were performed in duplicate. Data collected included: population, definition of opioid, benzodiazepine or mixed IWS, its assessment and management (drug or strategy, route of administration, dosage and titration), previous drug exposures and outcomes measures. Methodological quality assessment was performed by two independent reviewers using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs and the ROBINS-I tool for NRSI. A qualitative synthesis of the results is provided. For the subset of studies evaluating multifaceted protocolised care, we meta-analysed results for 4 outcomes and examined the quality of evidence using GRADE post hoc. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were eligible, including 10 NRSI and 3 RCTs; 11 of these included neonatal and paediatric patients exclusively. Eight studies evaluated multifaceted protocolised interventions, while 5 evaluated individual components of IWS management (e.g. clonidine or methadone at varying dosages, routes of administration and duration of tapering). IWS was measured using an appropriate tool in 6 studies. Ten studies reported upon occurrence of IWS, showing significant reductions (n = 4) or no differences (n = 6). Interventions failed to impact duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, and adverse effects. Impact on opioid and\/or benzodiazepine total doses and duration showed no differences in 4 studies, while 3 showed opioid and benzodiazepine cumulative doses were significantly reduced by 20\u201335% and 32\u201366%, and treatment durations by 1.5\u201311 and 19 days, respectively. Variable effects on intervention drug exposures were found. Weaning durations were reduced by 6\u201312 days (n = 4) for opioids and\/or methadone and by 13 days (n = 1) for benzodiazepines. In contrast, two studies using interventions centred on transition to enteral routes or longer tapering durations found significant increases in intervention drug exposures. Interventions had overall non-significant effects on additional drug requirements (except for one study). Included studies were at high risk of bias, relating to selection, detection and reporting bias. CONCLUSION: Interventions for IWS management fail to impact duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU length of stay, while effect on occurrence of IWS and drug exposures is inconsistent. Heterogeneity in the interventions used and methodological issues, including inappropriate and\/or subjective identification of IWS and bias due to study design, limited the conclusions.

Relevant patient characteristics and clinical information including the surgical procedure, specimens, pathological characteristics, and patients' post-operative state were analysed and the feasibility of p-taTME in patients with rectal cancer was assessed. Results Fifty-five patients who had undergone p-taTME were included in this study. They comprised 32 (58.2%) men and 23 (41.8%) women with a mean age of 65.6 \u00b1 10.6 years and mean body mass index of 23.4 \u00b1 3.3 kg\/m2. The median surgical time was 180.0 (range, 130-360) min and estimated blood loss was 25.0 (range, 15-80) mL. The commonest post-operative complication was varying degrees of faecal incontinence (56.4%). However, such incontinence greatly improved after pelvic-floor-function-rehabilitation exercises and did not seriously affect the patients' quality of life. Conclusions p-taTME is a relatively safe and incisionless procedure for patients with middle and low rectal cancer, especially in those with obesity or a narrow pelvis. However, further studies of the indications and long-term efficacy are needed to verify the suitability of this procedure.","publish_time":1580515200000,"author_summary":" Wang, Xiao-Ming; Xu, Yan-Yan; Yu, Gang; Rong,<br>Zhen; Geng, Rui-Chao; Wang, Rui; Chen, Long-Yi; Liu,<br>Gang","abstract_summary":" Background Although the anatomic<br>difficulties of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer have<br>been resolved by hybrid transanal total mesorectal<br>excision (h-taTME), a completely incisionless<br>surgical procedure has not yet been developed.

The occurrence of perineal hernia after abdominoperineal resection (APR) is rare, but it has been reported in recent years that the incidence of perineal hernia after rectal cancer surgery has increased. This has been attributed to a shift towards extralevator abdominoperineal resection, together with more frequent and long-term use of neoadjuvant therapy.

We decided to perform robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery on this patient using the da Vinci Surgical System. The perineal hernia was repaired by primary closure with the placement of a non-absorbable synthetic mesh as reinforcement for the pelvic floor. No complications occurred during the operation, and the patient was discharged on the third day after the operation. Clinical follow-up proceeded at the designated time intervals without difficulties. DISCUSSION The recurrence rates of perineal hernia are still very high, and due to poor view, suturing, and mesh placement in the deep pelvis, surgeons face many challenges.

The secondary endpoints were determining the reasons for conversion to open surgery, with detailed analyses of these cases and a comparison of the surgical outcome with and without conversion. RESULTS Seven patients (10%) required conversion to open surgery during LDP. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) was identified as a risk factor for conversion (p = 0.010). The reasons for conversion included technical difficulty (two bleeding, one severe adhesion) and pancreatic stump-related issues (two margin-positive, two stapling failures). Although the overall morbidity rate (29 vs. 11%, p = 0.48) and the rate of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (14 vs. 5%, p = 0.82) were no different for the patients with or without open conversion, the postoperative hospital stay was significantly longer in the former (median 15 vs. 10 days, p = 0.03).

Materials and methods: Forty-eight patients with abnormal papillary frenum were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly assigned into three groups; conventional frenectomy operation (C group), diode laser-assisted frenectomy (L group), and diode laser-assisted frenectomy with conventional horizontal incision on the periosteum (L + P group). Post-operative pain, discomfort in speaking, and chewing scores were assessed with visual analogue scale (VAS) at post-operative 3rd hour and on days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 45. Epithelialization process of the wound surface was evaluated by hydrogen peroxide solution applied to the wound on days 7, 14, 21, and 45 following operations. The distance between the frenum attachment point and mucogingival junction (FMGJ) was recorded at baseline, post-operative 45th day, and 6th month to assess the reattachment of the frenum. Plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, and probing depth were recorded at baseline and post-operative 7th, 14th, 21st, and 45th days. Results: On the 1st and 7th day after operation, VAS pain score in the C group was significantly higher than in the L and L + P groups (p < 0.017). Difficulty in speaking and chewing scores were significantly lower in the L and L + P groups compared to the C group at post-operative 3rd hour and 7th day (p < 0.017).

The neurocutaneous flap depends on the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve (LACN) and its retrograde-flow has been studied via cadaveric dissection. The aim of this study is to prove the vascularity of the lateral antebrachial neurocutaneous (LABN) flap. METHODS The distally based LABN flap was created in 18 upper limbs (12 cadavers). The skin flap was dissected at the proximal half of the forearm and then diluted methylene blue was injected through the brachial artery. The pedicle of the flap on the distal half of the forearm was dissected along the LACN for the anatomical study of the perforating branches, paraneural vessels, and flap territory. RESULTS The mean age of cadavers was 74.1 years (nine males). The mean distance of most distal and proximal perforating branches from the radial styloid process were 2.32 \u00b1 0.59 and 11.17 \u00b1 1.72 cm, respectively. The mean total number of perforating branches was 7.4, which abundantly appeared approximately 4 to 5 cm from the radial styloid process. The mean flap territory was 8.64 \u00b1 0.82 cm in width and 10.50 \u00b1 1.90 cm in length. The mean forearm circumference was 24.84 \u00b1 1.52 cm, and mean forearm length was 24.74 \u00b1 1.8 cm. CONCLUSION This study ensured that retrograde-flow via the neurocutaneous artery could be provided through the vascularity of the LABN flap, which suggests that the pivot point of the flap should not extend beyond 5 cm proximal to the radial styloid process.

Patients were divided into one of two groups according to different treatment modalities: study group (TAE combined with RFA assisted by 3DVAPS [n = 32]); and control (RFA only [n = 30]). Oncological outcomes included ablation-related complications, local tumor progression (LTP), and overall survival (OS). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to assess risk factors associated with LTP and OS. RESULTS HCC lesions (mean size, 1.9 \u00b1 1.0 mm in diameter) abutting the gastrointestinal tract (n = 25), heart and diaphragm (n = 21), major vessels (n = 13), and gallbladder (n = 3) were treated. A significant difference was detected in LTP between the two groups (P = 0.034), with no significant difference in OS between the two groups (P = 0.193). There were no severe complications related to ablation. Univariate analysis revealed that sex (P = 0.046) and child-turcotte-pugh (CTP) grade (P<0.001) were risk factors for OS, whereas CTP grade and treatment method (P<0.001) were risk factors for LTP. Multivariate analysis revealed that CTP grade B (P = 0.005) was independently associated with poor OS, and RFA alone (P<0.001) was independently associated with poor LTP.

PATIENT CONCERNS The patient presented with pain and mild swelling in his left knee after he slipped on the floor and fell on his left knee. He has no significant past medical or surgical history. The patient took the tension band wiring as the first choice because of the wide acceptance. But he worried about the complications. DIAGNOSES X-ray showed a transverse fracture of the left patella with an inferior pole occult fracture. INTERVENTIONS The patient was operated with a modified technique of the classic tension band wiring for patellar fractures. In our 4-step procedure, double tension cerclage wires were wrapped under the exposed ends of the Kirschner wires (K-wires) and the tendons in figure-of-8 fashion. The aim was to increase the biomechanical strength so that when one of the tension wires fail, the other one can hold the fragments together. OUTCOMES The patient recovered very well and without any complications. The patient was followed-up for 1 year and the fracture has united very well, with satisfying knee range of motion. LESSONS From this case study, we can detect the biomechanical advantages of our technique which can increase the stability of the fracture and that allows early functional exercise and additionally the micromotion at the fracture site has a beneficial effect of fracture union.

The volume of parastomal hernia (VPH), volume of the abdominal cavity (VAC), and the VPH\/VAC ratio were measured before and after PPP using abdominal computed tomography scan data. All the hernias were repaired by a laparoscopic or laparoscopic-open-laparoscopic approach using the intraperitoneal Sugarbaker technique. RESULTS Before and after PPP, the mean VPH was 1442 and 1581 mL (P<0.01), and the mean VAC was 5667 and 9194 mL (P<0.01). The VAC increased by 3527 mL (P<0.01) and was greater than the mean VPH before PPP. The VPH\/VAC ratio after PPP was reduced at an average of 8.1% (P<0.01).

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed all patients who underwent CB ablation in our institution from June 2018. From June 2019, we have been consistently using FoE suture for hemostasis (FoE+ group), and before that conventional manual compression was utilized (FoE- group). Ablations were performed under uninterrupted oral anticoagulant strategy. Both femoral veins were punctured, and a single introducer was placed in each vein. In the FoE- group, after ablation, protamine was administered, and manual compression was applied. In the FoE+ group, the suture was placed in both groins without protamine administration and manual compression. All patients were in decubitus position until the next morning. RESULTS A total of 190 consecutive patients (73.2% male, 59.7 \u00b1 11.0 years old) were evaluated, 90 being in the FoE+ group. There was no difference in the mean procedure duration between two groups (72.7 \u00b1 23.1 min vs 73.7 \u00b1 27.1 min, p = 0.784).

TA was associated with other procedures in 57% of cases (liver resection 81%). All TA were done without liver clamping. Median tumor size was 1.8 cm [ranges from 0.3 to 4.5], 18% of the lesions were larger than 3 cm in size and 11% close to major liver vessels. Tumors locations were 77.5% in right liver, 36% in S7&S8, and 46% in S7&S8&S4a. RESULTS Mortality was nil and morbidity rate 15.4% including Dindo-Clavien > II grade 3%. The median follow-up was 24 months [0.77-75]. Per lesion LR rate after TA was 18% (n = 19 patients) with a mean time of 7.6 months. Among patients with LR, 18 (95%) could have been re-treated successfully (new resection = 11, re-TA = 7). Multivariate analyses revealed that tumor location in S7 alone, S7&S8 and\/or S7, S8, or S4a were independent risk factors of LR after TA.

We report a case series of three patients who underwent fluoroscopic balloon dilation (FBD) for early jejunojejunostomy obstruction (JJO) after gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction (R-Y reconstruction). CASE PRESENTATION Three patients were referred to our hospital for surgery for gastric cancer. Robot-assisted distal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection and antecolic R-Y reconstruction were performed in two patients, and robot-assisted total gastrectomy with D1+ lymph node dissection and antecolic R-Y reconstruction was performed in one patient. The jejunojejunostomy was created as a side-to-side anastomosis using a linear 45-mm stapler. The entry hole was closed with a knotless barbed suture, and serosal-muscle layer suture reinforcement with an absorbable suture was performed at the jejunojejunostomy. Subsequently, all the patients were diagnosed with JJO by computed tomography and upper gastrointestinal series. The average time to JJO from gastrectomy was 5 days (range 2-7); initial clinical symptoms were vomiting in all three cases, with simultaneous upper abdominal pain in one case. We successfully performed FBD in all three cases after unsuccessful conservative treatment using an ileus tube. The clinical symptoms improved soon after FBD, and all the patients were able to avoid re-operation. The average period to FBD from JJO was 10 days (range 4-14). The average procedure time was 46 min (range 29-68), and the average duration to oral intake from FBD was 4 days (range 2-5). The average duration of hospital stay after FBD was 12 days (range 9-15).

Patient demographics, indications for surgery, graft size, degree of postoperative lid advancement, and complications were reviewed. RESULTS A total of 12 patients (16 eyelids) received Permacol implants for correction of lower eyelid retraction during the study period of 18 months (January 2015 to July 2017). Ten procedures were related to thyroid eye disease, 3 for reconstruction, 2 postcosmetic lower lid blepharoplasty, and one acquired anophthalmic socket.

Median PSA was 8.22 ng\/ml (IQR 5.74-13.31). 84.8% of patients were intermediate risk or high risk pre-operatively, as per AUA\/ASTRO\/SUO guidelines. 96.0% had Gleason Score 7 or worse disease on final pathologic analysis. Positive margin incidence was 18.1% and 44.4% in patients with pT2 and pT3 disease, respectively, of which 75.4% were unifocal. Immediate continence (i.e., continence achieved within 1 month post-operatively) was achieved in 45.2% of patients. Three-month and 1-year continence rates were 70.0% and 92.0%, respectively. Caucasian patients experienced earlier return of continence (77% versus 65% at 3 months) compared to African American patients. IPSS scores gradually improved from 8.0 pre-operatively to 4.0 1-year later. Median PSA level was 0.01 ng\/ml (IQR 0.01-9.01) post-operatively. Retzius-sparing robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is an oncologically safe surgical technique with excellent short- and long-term continence outcomes. Caucasian patients may have earlier return of continence compared to African Americans.","publish_time":1590710400000,"author_summary":" Sayyid, Rashid K; Sherwood, Dalton; Simpson,<br>William G; Terris, Martha K; Klaassen, Zachary; Madi,<br>Rabii","abstract_summary":" Our objective is to report the functional and<br>oncologic outcomes of a cohort of 250 consecutive<br>prostate cancer patients undergoing a Retzius-sparing<br>approach and to assess for racial differences in<br>continence outcomes.

METHODS The Prospective Hernia Study is an ongoing, multicenter, comparative, open-label analysis of clinical and patient-reported outcomes from robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) versus open and RAS versus laparoscopic IHR procedures. Patient responses to the Carolinas Comfort Scale (CCS) questionnaire provided QOL outcomes. RESULTS 504 enrolled patients underwent unilateral or bilateral IHR (RAS, n = 159; open, n = 190; laparoscopic, n = 155) at 17 medical institutions from May 2016 through December 2018. Propensity score matching provided a balanced comparison: RAS versus open (n = 112 each) and RAS versus laparoscopic (n = 80 each). Overall, operative times were significantly different between the RAS and laparoscopic cases (83 vs. 65 min; p < 0.001). Fewer RAS patients required prescription pain medication than either open (49.5% vs. 80.0%; p < 0.001) or laparoscopic patients (45.3% vs. 65.4%; p = 0.013). Median number of prescription pain pills taken differed for RAS vs. open (0.5 vs. 15.5; p = 0.001) and were comparable for RAS vs laparoscopic (7.0 vs. 6.0; p = 0.482) among patients taking prescribed pain medication. Time to return to normal activities differed for RAS vs. open (3 vs. 4 days; p = 0.005) and were comparable for RAS vs. laparoscopic (4 vs. 4 days; p = 0.657). Median CCS scores through 3 months were comparable for the three approaches. Postoperative complication rates for the three groups also were comparable. One laparoscopic case was converted to open. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that IHR can be performed effectively with the robotic-assisted, laparoscopic, or open approaches. There was no difference in the median number of prescription pain medication pills taken between the RAS and laparoscopic groups. A difference was observed in the overall number of patients reporting the need to take prescription pain medication. Comparable operative times were observed for RAS unilateral IHR patients compared to open unilateral IHR patients; however, operative times for RAS overall and bilateral subjects were longer than for open patients. Operative times were longer overall for RAS patients compared to laparoscopic patients; however, there was no difference in conversion and complication rate in the RAS vs. laparoscopic groups or the complication rate in the RAS vs. open group. Time to return to normal activities for RAS IHR patients was comparable to that of laparoscopically repaired patients and significantly sooner compared to open IHR patients.","publish_time":1591142400000,"author_summary":" LeBlanc, K; Dickens, E; Gonzalez, A; Gamagami,<br>R; Pierce, R; Balentine, C; Voeller, G","abstract_summary":" PURPOSE To evaluate and compare<br>peri-operative outcomes through 30 days, including pain and<br>quality of life (QOL) through 3 months across three<br>cohorts of inguinal hernia repair (IHR) patients<br>(robotic-assisted, laparoscopic, and open IHR).

Results A total of 134 hernias were repaired in 124 patients who had 53 (42.7%) right, 61 (49.2%) left, and 10 (8.1%) bilateral groin hernias. The most common hernia type was an indirect inguinal hernia in 83\/134 (62%) groin hernias. A total of 119 (88.8%) and 15 (11.2%) hernias were primary and recurrent, respectively.

INCLUSION CRITERIA studies that arthroscopically evaluated the fibular displacement at various stages of syndesmotic ligament injury. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the Anatomical Quality Assessment (AQUA) Tool and methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS). RESULTS Eight cadaveric studies and three clinical studies were included for review. All studies reported displacement in the coronal plane, four studies reported in the sagittal plane, and one reported findings in the rotational plane. Four cadaveric studies had a similar experimental set up and the weighted mean associated with instability in the coronal plane could be calculated and was 2.9 mm at the anterior portion of the distal tibiofibular joint and 3.4 mm at the posterior portion. Syndesmotic instability in the sagittal plane is less extensively studied, however available data from a cadaveric study suggests thresholds of 2.2 mm of posterior fibular translation when performing an anterior to posterior hook test and 2.6 mm of anterior fibular translation when performing a posterior to anterior hook test. CONCLUSIONS The results have concluded that the commonly used 2.0 mm threshold value of distal tibiofibular diastasis may lead to overtreatment of syndesmotic instability, and that using threshold values of 2.9 mm measured at the anterior portion of the incisura and 3.4 mm at the posterior portion may represent better cut off values.

METHODS Patients undergoing free flap breast reconstruction from 2015 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who returned to the operating room for a revision of the anastomosis were excluded from analysis. Patients were divided in two groups based on the development of late complications. Those were defined as fat necrosis, wound dehiscence, or distal flap ischemia\/necrosis that developed after discharge from the hospital. Mean percutaneous oximetry readings of the first 24 hours were recorded and the mean change from the initial reading was calculated. The correlation between tissue oximetry change and development of complications was explored. RESULTS A total of 120 patients were identified. The mean age was 53, while the mean body mass index was 33. A total of 38 patients developed late wound complication. History of smoking, diabetes mellitus, neoadjuvant radiation therapy, and the mean change of the tissue oximetry reading were identified as independent predictors of wound complications. The absolute number of the tissue oximetry reading did not predict late complications. A multivariate analysis revealed that patients who experienced a mean decrease < 15% from the initial reading during the first 24 hours were significantly more likely to develop late flap-related wound complications. CONCLUSION In patients undergoing free tissue breast reconstruction, tissue oximetry readings do not predict late wound complications.

The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review of the available evidence surrounding the safety and efficiency of gasless laparoscopy compared to conventional laparoscopy and open techniques and to analyze the benefits that gasless laparoscopy has for low resource setting hospitals. METHODS This protocol is developed by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis-Protocols (PRISMA-P). The PRISMA statement guidelines and flowchart will be used to conduct the study itself. MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, and Global Index Medicus (WHO) will be searched and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials database. The articles that will be found will be pooled into Covidence article manager software where all the records will be screened for eligibility and duplicates removed.

The primary endpoint was median overall survival (OS), and secondary endpoints were median time to treatment failure, overall response rate, and the incidence of adverse events. Clinical outcomes were compared using propensity score matched analysis. RESULTS Data from 57 patients were analyzed (T-B group: 21 patients, T group: 36 patients). Median OS was significantly longer in the T-B group than the T group (14.4 months vs. 4.5 months, p < .001). Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that combination therapy with Bmab was significantly correlated with OS. Propensity score matched analysis confirmed that the median OS was significantly longer in the T-B group than the T group (14.4 months vs. 6.1 months, p = .006) and that there was a significant correlation between Bmab and OS.

The secondary endpoint of this trial was comparison of surgical outcomes among the groups that received different methods of esophagojejunostomy (EJ). METHODS The 160 patients of the full analysis set group were divided into three groups according to the method of EJ, the extracorporeal circular stapling group (EC; n = 45), the intracorporeal circular stapling group (IC; n = 64), and the intracorporeal linear stapling group (IL; n = 51). The clinicopathologic characteristics and the surgical outcomes were compared among these three groups. RESULTS There were no significant differences in the early complication rates among the three groups (26.7% vs. 18.8% vs. 17.6%, EC vs. IC vs. IL; p = 0.516). The length of mini-laparotomy incision was significantly longer in the EC group than in the IC or IL group. The anastomosis time was significantly shorter in the EC group than in the IL group. The time to first flatus was significantly shorter in the IL group than in the EC group.

Eligible articles included patients with ACL injury (diagnosis confirmed by MRI and\/or diagnostic arthroscopy), reported the number of meniscal tears at the time of ACL injury diagnosis\/start of treatment and reported the number of new meniscal tears that subsequently occurred. Articles with fewer than 20 patients at follow-up, and articles limited to ACL revision surgery or multi-ligament knee injuries were excluded. Two independent reviewers screened articles, assessed eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We judged the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group methodology. RESULTS Of 75 studies included in the systematic review, 54 studies with 9624 patients and 501 new meniscal tears were appropriate for quantitative analysis. Heterogeneity precluded data pooling. The risk of new meniscal tears was 0%-21% when follow-up was <2 years, 0%-29% when follow-up was 2 to 5 years, 5%-52% when follow-up was 5 to 10 years and 4%-31% when follow-up was longer than 10 years.

METHODS A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, CINAHL and SportDiscus was conducted from inception to October 2018. Prospective clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of SWT based on changes in imaging outcomes were eligible for inclusion.

Random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression with a priori determined covariates was conducted for each condition to determine potential predictors of SWT effects. RESULTS Sixty-three studies were included, with data from 27 studies available for effect size pooling. Meta-analyses and meta-regression on imaging outcomes were performed for rotator cuff calcific tendinitis (n = 11), plantar fasciitis (n = 7) and osteonecrosis of the femoral head (n = 9). There was an overall reduction in the size of measured lesion following SWT (MD 8.44 mm (95%CI -4.30, 12.57), p < 0.001) for calcium deposit diameter, (MD 0.92 mm (95%CI -0.03, 1.81), p = 0.04) for plantar fascia thickness and (MD 4.84% (95%CI -0.06, 9.75), p = 0.05) for lesion size in femoral head osteonecrosis.

METHODS This retrospective single-center study included patients who underwent transvaginal mesh surgery with Uphold\u2122 between October 2010 and December 2017. The primary outcome was the prevalence of SUI at 12 months postoperatively. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risks factors for postoperative SUI. RESULTS Of the 308 women included, 123 (40%) were continent (no SUI), 108 (35%) had SUI, and 76 (25%) had occult SUI. Forty-nine patients (15.9%) had a concomitant MUS procedure.

Although open cholecystectomy with the closure of the fistula is the gold standard treatment for nonobstructing biliary-enteric fistulas, the optimal treatment for CGF has not been established. Laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS), a minimally invasive surgery for gastric submucosal tumors, reportedly helps achieve favorable postoperative outcomes. This report presents a case wherein CGF was treated with LECS. CASE PRESENTATION An-84-year-old man with a history of chemotherapy for ileocecal diffuse large B cell lymphoma presented with fever and abdominal pain. He was diagnosed with cholangitis, and endoscopic lithotripsy was performed. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed gastric wall thickening close to the gallbladder, indicating a malignant lymphoma. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a concavity on the anterior wall of the antrum of the stomach. Direct endoscopic cholangiography, which was performed by the injection of a contrast medium into the concavity, confirmed the concavity to be a CGF. Cholecystectomy with the closure of the fistula using the LECS was performed to check for suture line leakage and the positional relation of the suture line and the pylorus. The resected specimen showed acute and chronic cholecystitis without malignancy. The patient did not experience postoperative complications in the subsequent 3 months. DISCUSSION Resection and closure of the fistula using LECS were performed successfully. CONCLUSION LECS can be performed for CGF. LECS enables intraoperative observation of the fistula and suture line, and thus reduces postoperative complications.","publish_time":1589500800000,"author_summary":" Fujimoto, Goshi","abstract_summary":" INTRODUCTION Cholecystoenteric fistula<br>(CEF) is rare in biliary tract surgery, and<br>cholecystogastric fistula (CGF) is the rarest form of CEF.<br>Although open cholecystectomy with the closure of the<br>fistula is the gold standard treatment for<br>nonobstructing biliary-enteric fistulas, the optimal<br>treatment for CGF has not been established.

Pigs are often used as surgical models in translational research; however, reports of tissue reactions to both suture materials in pigs are limited. The aim of this study was to assess clinical and histologic responses of skin incisions closed with a subcuticular technique using glycomer 631 and lactomer 9-1 in pigs. RESULTS Skin incisions on 17 pigs were closed with glycomer 631 and lactomer 9-1, and a clinical reactive score (CRS) including erythema, swelling, discharge and dehiscence was calculated on postoperative days 7 and 14. Subcuticular tissue reaction was assessed histologically on postoperative day 14 (the presence of extravascular neutrophils, macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, bacterial colonies and the overall severity of the inflammatory response to the suture material), and the cumulative score of the variables was calculated as an aggregate tissue irritation score (ATIS). Tissue samples were examined for suture extrusion and evaluated microbiologically. The clinical reactive score did not differ between the suture materials. Only one ATIS variable, namely the overall severity of the inflammatory response, was lower (p = 0.029) when glycomer 631 was used. Suture extrusion was found in 10\/17 of the incisions closed by glycomer 631 and in 7\/13 of the incisions closed by lactomer 9-1. Trueperella pyogenes was isolated from the skin and from the area of tissue reaction in six pigs. CONCLUSIONS No difference in CRS between the suture materials was observed, and thus both materials may be used for the subcuticular technique in pigs. Glycomer 631 induced less tissue reaction only in terms of the overall severity of the inflammatory response. Suture extrusion was observed in more than 50% of incisions regardless of the suture material, possibly due to a large amount of suture material in the wound.

Therefore, a systematic review of the literature regarding treatment strategies employed in recurrent pediatric MB will evaluate previous salvage therapies in order to guide future clinical trials. The aim of this systematic review will be to investigate the efficacy and safety of salvage therapies for the management of children with progressive, treatment-refractory, or recurrent MB. METHODS We will conduct literature searches (from 1995 onwards) in MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Studies examining the survival and toxicity of therapies administered to treatment-refractory pediatric MB patients will be included. Two reviewers will independently assess the search results based on predefined selection criteria, complete data abstraction, and quality assessment. The primary outcomes of this review will be overall and progression-free survival. Secondary outcomes will include safety and toxicity of each therapy administered. The study methodological quality (or bias) will be appraised using an appropriate tool. Due to the nature of the research question and published literature, we expect large inter-study heterogeneity and therefore will use random effects regression analysis to extract the combined effect.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study was conducted based on prospectively maintained data in a cohort of patients who underwent either RYGB with a Roux limb of a 150 cm and a BPL of 50 cm (n = 145), OAGB with a 200-cm BPL (n = 272), or OAGB with a 160-cm BPL (n = 383), from March 2013 to 2017 at three university hospitals by a single surgical team. RESULTS Groups were comparable regarding age and sex. Mean preoperative body mass indexes of the RYGB, OAGB-160, and OAGB-200 groups were 44.5 \u00b1 5.8, 45.6 \u00b1 6.3, and 46.7 \u00b1 6.4 kg\/m2, respectively. One-year follow-up rates were 83.4%, 85.3%, and 82.5% for the RYGB, OAGB-200, and OAGB-160 groups, respectively. One-year percent total weight loss values were 33.8 \u00b1 6.7 after OAGB-160 and 35.3 \u00b1 6.9 after OAGB-200 (P = 0.056), which were significantly greater compared with 30.9 \u00b1 8.9 after RYGB (P < 0.001). All groups were comparable regarding remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver. Mean operative time was longer with RYGB than with either OAGB techniques. Groups were comparable for postoperative complications except for the incidence of protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM), occurring in 11 patients (4.7%) after OAGB-200, 7 of whom required revisional surgery, in one patient (0.3%) after OAGB-160 who responded to parenteral alimentation, but in no patients after RYGB. CONCLUSION After 1 year, OAGB with a 160-cm BPL was as effective as OAGB with a 200-cm BPL and RYGB, but safer than OAGB-200. This approach also avoided the need for revisional surgery following postoperative malnutrition.","publish_time":1589414400000,"author_summary":" Khalaj, Alireza; Mousapour, Pouria;<br>Motamedi, Mohammad Ali Kalantar; Mahdavi, Maryam;<br>Valizadeh, Majid; Hosseinpanah, Farhad; Barzin, Maryam","abstract_summary":" PURPOSE One-anastomosis gastric bypass<br>(OAGB) has raised concerns about nutritional<br>complications possibly attributed to the biliopancreatic<br>limb (BPL) length.

Causes are multifactorial, with the size of the end-to-end anastomosis (EEA) stapler a modifiable factor and potential target for risk reduction. Our goal was to examine the impact of the EEA stapler size on the risk of anastomotic complications in left-sided colorectal resections. METHODS A prospective divisional database was reviewed for consecutive elective left-sided resections with a colorectal anastomosis using an EEA stapler from January 2013 May 2018 inclusive. Patients were stratified into 25-29 mm or 30-33 mm cohorts. Patient and disease demographics, operative variables, and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. The main outcome measures were the rate and factors associated with anastomotic complications. RESULTS Four hundred seventy-three cases were evaluated, 185 ( 39.1%) were in the 25-29 mm group and 288 (60.9%) in the 30-33 mm group. Patients were comparable in demographics and operative variables. More males were anastomosed with the 30-33 mm than with the 25-29 mm stapler (57.6% vs 28.6%, p < 0.01). Significantly more patients developed an anastomotic stricture with the 25-29 mm than with the 30-33 mm staplers (7.1% vs. 2.1%; p = 0.007). There was no significant difference in leak rates or reoperation\/interventions between groups. On logistic regression, neither gender, operative indication nor approach were associated with anastomotic leak, readmission, or reoperation\/intervention. Stapler size remained significantly associated with stricture (p = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS The 25-29 mm EEA staplers were associated with an increased rate of anastomotic stricture compared to 30-33 mm staplers in left-sided colorectal anastomoses. As stapler size is a simple process measure that is easily modifyable, this is a potential target for improving anastomotic complication rates. Further controlled trials may help assess the impact of stapler size on improving patient and quality outcomes.","publish_time":1581120000000,"author_summary":" Reif de Paula, T; Simon, H; Shah, M; Lee-Kong, S;<br>Kiely, J M; Kiran, R P; Keller, D S","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND Colorectal anastomotic<br>complications are dreaded and dramatically affect outcomes.<br>Causes are multifactorial, with the size of the<br>end-to-end anastomosis (EEA) stapler a modifiable factor<br>and potential target for risk reduction.

We describe the GI-related patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of patients with anal cancer receiving chemoradiotherapy to improve patient-physician communication. METHODS We prospectively followed patients with nonmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal who received definitive chemoradiotherapy. Patients completed the bowel subdomain of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire before treatment and at 4 subsequent timepoints. We used the paired Wilcoxon test to compare EPIC scores at different times. RESULTS The study included 21 patients; median age was 57 years. Most patients (52%) had T2 and either N0 or N1 disease (81%). Most patients (91%) received chemotherapy with cisplatin-fluorouracil and either intensity-modulated radiotherapy or volumetric modulated arc therapy. Compared with the patients' median overall summary score at baseline (66), their median score at 1 week (82) was higher (P = .009), whereas their median score at 5 weeks (54) was lower (P = .025).

METHODS AND ANALYSIS Major electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, AMED, BIOSIS, CINAHL and PsycINFO) will be searched for multi-dose randomised-trials examining the comparative effectiveness of opioid versus opioid-free analgesia after surgical discharge. Studies published from January 1990 to July 2019 will be targeted, with no language restrictions. The search will be re-run before manuscript submission to include most recent literature. We will consider studies involving patients undergoing minor and major surgery. Teams of reviewers will, independently and in duplicate, assess eligibility, extract data and evaluate risk of bias. Our main outcomes of interest are pain intensity and postoperative vomiting. Study results will be pooled using random effects models. When trials report outcomes for a common domain (eg, pain intensity) using different scales, we will convert effect sizes to a common standard metric (eg, Visual Analogue Scale). Minimally important clinical differences reported in previous literature will be considered when interpreting results. Subgroup analyses defined a priori will be conducted to explore heterogeneity. Risk of bias will be assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. The quality of evidence for all outcomes will be evaluated using the GRADE rating system.

METHODS A systematic review was performed using keywords and Medical Subject Headings search terms. PubMed, EmBase, the Cochrane Library, and Scopus were searched using the appropriate search terms. Data collected from each study included patient satisfaction and complications, in addition to injection material, location, and technique. RESULTS Four thousand six hundred thirty-two studies were found based on search criteria. After full-text screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria, 23 studies were included. A total of 1600 patients underwent nonsurgical rhinoplasty, most commonly with hyaluronic acid (73.38 percent), followed by calcium hydroxyapatite (12.44 percent). Nearly 95 percent of patients were satisfied with results, and there were only 26 relatively minor complications reported. There were no reports of vascular complications such as skin necrosis or visual compromise. CONCLUSIONS Based on the authors' review of the literature, nonsurgical rhinoplasty is an effective temporary alternative to traditional augmentation rhinoplasty for corrections of nasal shape with a high degree of patient satisfaction. Complications may be underreported, and thus further investigation is needed to better understand the true incidence of major complications related to vascular compromise.","publish_time":1593561600000,"author_summary":" Williams, Lauren C; Kidwai, Sarah M; Mehta,<br>Karan; Kamel, George; Tepper, Oren M; Rosenberg,<br>Joshua D","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND Nonsurgical rhinoplasty using<br>filler injections has become a common procedure in<br>cosmetic practices.

This individual received no surgical or pharmacological treatments; however, it is questionable whether any specific treatments would have been beneficial. Ecstasy ingestion leads to a serotonin surge and induces microvascular changes. Neurovascular hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, de novo aneurysm formation, and subsequent rupture can occur. 5-hydroxytryptamine, which comes from serotonergic terminals, is a very potent vasoconstrictive amine and can thus lead to prolonged vasoconstriction and ischemia. It is most likely that the SCI\/D in our case is the result of an ischemic event following the vasoconstrictive effects of ecstasy ingestion.

METHODS An online survey on VTE prophylaxis practice patterns and perceptions was emailed to 172 H&N microsurgeons in the United States using an anonymous link. RESULTS There were 74 respondents (43% response rate). These surgeons completed residencies in otolaryngology (59%), plastic surgery (31%), and oral maxillofacial surgery (7%). Most underwent fellowship training (95%) and have practiced at an academic center (97%) for at least 6 years (58%), performing an average of 42 \u00b1 31 H&N free flap cases per year (range = 1-190). Most adhered to general VTE prophylaxis guidelines (69%) while 11% did not and 20% were unsure. Nearly all surgeons (99%) would provide prophylactic anticoagulation, mostly in the form of subcutaneous heparin (51%) or enoxaparin (44%); 64% additionally used aspirin, while 4% used aspirin alone. The majority of surgeons (68%) reported having postoperative VTE complications, with six surgeons (8%) reporting patient deaths due to pulmonary embolism. A third of the surgeons have encountered VTE prophylaxis-related adverse bleeding events, but most still believe that chemoprophylaxis is important for VTE prevention (92%). While 35% of surgeons were satisfied with their current practice, most would find it helpful to have official prophylactic anticoagulation guidelines specific to H&N free flap cases.

Some predictors of treatment outcome are suggested, but the evidence is limited. The primary aim of this study was to explore if selected pre-treatment characteristics of the participants in a recently conducted randomized controlled trial were associated with treatment outcome. Methods In this study secondary analysis of data collected in a randomized trial were conducted. The participants were women with chronic pelvic pain randomized to two different physical therapy treatments. Analyses in this study were performed for the whole group as a cohort. The primary outcome measure was change in pain intensity from baseline to 12 months, measured with the numeric rating scale (0-10). The women were asked to rate their mean pelvic pain intensity during the last 7 days. Based on previous research and on available variables from the randomized controlled trial four potential predictive factors were derived from the baseline data and assessed one by one in a linear regression model, adjusted for age and treatment group. The variables with strongest association (p < 0.10) with the primary outcome were further included in a multivariable linear regression model with backward selection, adjusted for age and treatment group. Results Fifty women (mean age 38.1, SD = 12.2) were included in the analysis. For these women the mean change in pain intensity was -1.2 points (95% CI -1.8 to -0.7) from baseline to 12 months. The multivariable regression model showed that pelvic pain duration of 6 years or more was associated with less decrease in pain intensity with a regression coefficient of 1.3 (95% CI 0.3-2.4). Baseline pain intensity was associated with higher pain reduction after PT treatment with a regression coefficient per SD increase in baseline pain of -0.6 (95% CI -1.1 to -0.1). None of the women with main pain site other places than in the pelvis reported any pain reduction after physical therapy treatment, but due to the small numbers the predictor was not included in the regression analysis. Conclusions We identified that pelvic pain duration of 6 years or more was associated with less pain reduction, and that higher baseline pain intensity was associated with higher pain reduction after physical therapy treatment in this sample of women with chronic pelvic pain. For the variable main pain site other places than the pelvis the results are unsure due to small numbers. Implications Based on our finding of long pain duration as a negative predictor for pain reduction, we emphasize that early intervention is important. Many of the participants in our RCT reported pelvic surgeries or other treatments prior to referral for PT, and we suggest that referral to a non-invasive intervention such as PT should be considered at an earlier stage. In order to tailor interventions to the individual women's needs, thorough baseline assessments, preferably in a multidisciplinary setting, should be performed.","publish_time":1593475200000,"author_summary":" Nygaard, Ane S; Haugstad, Gro K; Wilsgaard,<br>Tom; \u00d8ian, P\u00e5l; Stedenfeldt, Mona","abstract_summary":" Background and aims Women with chronic pelvic<br>pain represent a heterogeneous group, and it is<br>suggested that the existence of sub-groups can explain<br>varying results and inconclusiveness in clinical<br>trials.

METHODS A retrospective review was performed of consecutive women at an academic medical center with a diagnosis of DCIS at needle biopsy from 2007 to 2016. Medical records were reviewed for mode of presentation, imaging findings, biopsy pathology results, and surgical outcomes. Each patient with DCIS was evaluated for AS trial eligibility based on published criteria for the COMET, LORD, and LORIS trials. RESULTS During a 10-year period, DCIS was diagnosed in 858 women (mean age 58 years; range 28-89 years). Of the 858 women, 498 (58%) were eligible for the COMET trial, 101 (11.8%) for the LORD trial, and 343 (40%) for the LORIS trial.

So far, there is no consensus on how vascular reconstruction should be performed. Bovine pericardium has shown promising results, particularly in infected arterial vascular reconstructions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and technical success of portomesenteric venous vascular reconstruction using bovine pericardium in pancreatic resections. METHODS Retrospective analysis of portomesenteric reconstruction using bovine pericardium (patches, self-made tube grafts) in pancreatic resections between 2014 and 2019. The primary endpoint examined was the technical success rate and short-term patency of vascular reconstruction. In addition to clinical surveillance and laboratory routine testing, patency was tested with duplex scans (4 h postoperatively) and computed tomography imaging in case of an abnormal clinical course and as part of the oncological follow-up. RESULTS In 15 surgical procedures (pancreaticoduodenectomy (12, 80%), pancreatic left resection (3, 20%)), vascular reconstruction was performed with superior mesenteric vein (6\/15), portal vein (7\/15) and the junction between superior mesenteric and splenic vein (2\/15). Eighty percent of the reconstructions were tube grafts (12\/15), and the remaining were patch plasties. In 13\/15 (87%) of the cases, the vascular reconstruction was patent; in 2\/15 (13%), there was one stenosis without reintervention need and one graft failure with complete thrombosis. Out of 15 patients, 4 major complications according to Clavien-Dindo classification (IIIa n = 2, 13%; IIIb n = 1, 7%; V n = 1, 7%) were documented. Latest re-imaging after surgery among the 10 patients with imaging follow-up more than 1 month postoperatively was after 6.5 months ((median, interquartile range 4-12 months), and clinical follow-up was at 6.7 months (median, 3.3-13 months)). CONCLUSION Due to its off-the-shelf availability, portomesenteric reconstruction using bovine pericardium seems to be a feasible and safe method in pancreatic resection with vascular encasement.

Here, we aimed to establish whether the length of uniportal incision could affect postoperative pain and surgical outcomes in consecutive patients undergoing uniportal VATS lobectomy for early stage lung cancer. METHODS This was a unicenter Randomized Control Trial (NCT03218098). Consecutive patients undergoing uniportal VATS lobectomy for Stage I lung cancer were randomly assigned to a Small Incision group or Long Incision group in 1:1 ratio based on whether patients received a 4 cm or 8 cm incision. The endpoints were to compare the intergroup difference regarding (i) postoperative pain measured by brief pain inventory (BPI) questionnaire (first endpoint); (ii) operative time; (iii) length of chest drainage; (iv) length of hospital stay; (v) postoperative complications; and (vi) pulmonary functional status (secondary endpoints). RESULTS A total of 48 patients were eligible for the study. Four patients were excluded; the study population included 44 patients: 23 within the Small Incision group, and 21 within the Long Incision group. The 11 BPI scores between the two groups showed no significant difference. Small Incision group presented higher operative time than Long Incision group (138.69 vs. 112.14 minutes; P = 0.0001) while no significant differences were found regarding length of hospital stay (P = 0.95); respiratory complications (P = 0.92); FEV1% (P = 0.63), and 6-Minute Walking Test (P = 0.77).

We further examined the correlations between the expression level of EREG and clinicopathological features, tumor regression grade, and survival, including disease-specific survival (DSS), locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and metastasis-free survival (MeFS). RESULTS High EREG expression was significantly related to early pretreatment (pre-Tx) and posttreatment (post-Tx) tumor status (T1, T2, p = 0.047 and p < 0.001), pre-Tx and post-Tx negative nodal status (N0, p < 0.001 and p = 0.004), less vascular and perineurial invasion (p = 0.015 and p = 0.023), and higher tumor regression grade (p < 0.001).

However, the ideal dose and availability of butorphanol for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy are not well known. The aim of this study was to evaluated the 95% effective dose (ED95) of butorphanol and sufentanil in GI endoscopy and compared their clinical efficacy, especially regarding the recovery time. METHODS The study was divided into two parts. For the first part, voluntary patients who needed GI endoscopy anesthesia were recruited to measure the ED95 of butorphanol and sufentanil needed to achieve successful sedation before GI endoscopy using the sequential method (the Dixon up-and-down method). The second part was a double-blind, randomized study. Two hundred cases of painless GI endoscopy patients were randomly divided into two groups (n = 100), including group B (butorphanol at the ED95 dose) and group S (sufentanil at the ED95 dose). Propofol was infused intravenously as the sedative in both groups. The recovery time, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, hand grip strength, fatigue severity scores, incidence of nausea and vomiting, and incidence of dizziness were recorded. RESULTS The ED95 of butorphanol for painless GI endoscopy was 9.07 \u03bcg\/kg (95% confidence interval: 7.81-19.66 \u03bcg\/kg). The ED95 of sufentanil was 0.1 \u03bcg\/kg (95% CI, 0.079-0.422 \u03bcg\/kg). Both butorphanol and sufentanil provided a good analgesic effect for GI endoscopy.

Approach: A disposable device, DETEC\u00ae pH, was developed and characterized on its ability to map wound alkalinity by pressing a freshly recovered wound dressing against its test surface. By comparing the wound's alkalinity and size reduction rates (\u223c7 days) following pH measurement, we assessed the capability of wound alkalinity to prognosticate subsequent short-term wound size reduction rates. Results: The device had high accuracy and specificity in determining the alkalinity of simulated wound fluids soaked onto wound dressing. The type of wound dressing type had an insignificant effect on its detection sensitivity. Upon testing discarded wound dressings from human patients, the device quickly determined alkaline and acidic wounds. Finally, statistical analyses of wound size reduction rates in wounds with various alkalinities confirmed that wound alkalinity has a strong influence on, at least, short-term wound healing activity.

Tremendous effort has been spent to investigate the effective way to prevent this \"complication\" including the modification of surgical technique, use of per-peritoneal drainage, etc. There were debates about the use of monopolar diathermy versus blunt dissection in laparoscopic TEP in the prevention of seroma formation. This randomized study aims to compare the effects of using 2 techniques in laparoscopic TEP on pre-peritoneal drain output and seroma formation. METHOD From 1.9.2018 to 30.9.2019, all male and female patients presented with the first occurrence, unilateral inguinal hernia anticipated for laparoscopic TEP were enrolled into the study after informed consent. Patients were randomized into \"monopolar dissection preferred\" (MDP) group and \"blunt dissection-preferred\" (BDP) group just before commencing of operation after general anesthesia. Surgeons were instructed to use monopolar energy as main dissection method for the whole operation if possible (MDP), whereas blunt dissection is the preferred choice in BDP group, but the use of monopolar energy was allowed if needed. Total energy time was measured by a specially designed homemade device attaching to the monopolar pedals as accurate as to millisecond (ms). Pre-peritoneal drains were inserted for drainage and removed 23 h after operation. Drainage output, total operating time, energy time, clinical and ultrasonic seroma sizes at day 1, day 6, 1-month post operations, recurrence are compared between 2 groups. RESULTS A total of 103 patients where included. There was no significant difference in age, gender, co-morbidities, side of hernia, mean defect size, operating time, fixation adjuncts, or postoperative stay. The drain volume in BDP group is 71.13 \u00b1 31.42 mL while it in MDP group is 56.36 \u00b1 21.46 mL. The MDP group had significantly fewer drain output at 23 h post operation (p = 0.007) and lower seroma incidence on days 6 (p = 0.036). Overall incidence of seroma formation was 12% on postoperative day 1, 11% on postoperative day 7. No statistically differences in postoperative pain score or complications were observed at the first week, 1- and 3-months' post operation. There was no correlation with energy time to the drain output. No recurrence was found in subsequent follow-up. CONCLUSION Pre-peritoneal drainage is clinically safe in laparoscopic totally extra-peritoneal hernioplasty and can effectively reduce the size and incidence of seroma. The seroma formation can be further reduced by appropriate use of monopolar energy as preferred dissection approach in lap TEP. Due to limitation in measuring the actual energy time, the result should be further validated by randomized multi-centers trial on its potential benefit in hernia repair by a more accurate measuring device on energy used.","publish_time":1581984000000,"author_summary":" Liu, J W; Chen, K J; Xu, X H; Deng, Y; Zhang, H;<br>Chan, F S Y; Kim, H J; Fan, J K M","abstract_summary":" INTRODUCTION Seroma is a commonly encountered<br>sequela after hernia repair.

METHODOLOGY Three hundred and eight patients were randomly assigned into two equal groups according to whether occlusal reduction was done or not (n=154). For all patients, root canal treatment was carried out in two visits without intracanal medication. Patients assessed their pain using the 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) 6h, 12h 24h, 48h after the first visit (Postinstrumentation) and 6h and 12h following root canal filling (Postobturation). Patients, also, recorded their medication intake (Sham or analgesic) postinstrumentation and postobturation; patients initially received a sham capsule, but, if pain persisted, an analgesic was prescribed. Data were analysed using Mann-Whitney U-test, Friedman's test, Wilcoxon's rank test and Chi2 (\u03c72 ) test. The Relative Risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for binary data. RESULTS Occlusal reduction was associated with less pain intensity than no occlusal reduction at 12h and 24h postinstrumentation (p<0.05). Pain intensity significantly and gradually decreased with both groups at all postinstrumentation and postobturation timepoints compared to preoperative pain (p<0.05). The RR of moderate-to-severe pain was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.91) 12h postinstrumentation and the RR of pain incidence, regardless of its level, was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.92) 24h postinstrumentation. There was no significant difference in medication intake (sham or analgesic) between groups (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS Occlusal reduction was effective in reducing the intensity of postoperative pain 12h and 24h after root canal instrumentation in the first visit in patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with sensitivity to percussion. Occlusal reduction lowered the risk of moderate-to-severe pain by about 40% 12h postinstrumentation and the overall risk of pain by 25% 24h postinstrumentation; yet, it did not affect medication intake.","publish_time":1589673600000,"author_summary":" Ahmed, Y E; Emara, R S; Sarhan, S M; El Boghdadi, R<br>M; El-Bayoumi, M A A; El-Far, H M M; Sabet, N E; Abou<br>El-Nasr, H M; Gawdat, S I; Amin, S A W","abstract_summary":" AIM This randomized, prospective, controlled<br>trial assessed the effect of occlusal reduction on<br>postendodontic pain and medication intake following root<br>canal treatment of mandibular posterior teeth with<br>symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with sensitivity to<br>percussion treated in two visits.

The use of full, standard preparation and draping with standard personal protective equipment (PPE) may not be necessary during this procedure. This is of particular interest in the current climate as we face unprecedented PPE shortages due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS This is a retrospective chart review of 1,270 patients treated with CRPP of a supracondylar humeral fracture at 2 metropolitan pediatric centers by 10 fellowship-trained pediatric orthopaedic surgeons. One surgeon in the group did not wear a mask when performing CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures, and multiple surgeons in the group utilized a semisterile preparation technique (no sterile gown or drapes). Infectious outcomes were compared between 2 groups: full sterile preparation and semisterile preparation. We additionally analyzed a subgroup of patients who had semisterile preparation without surgeon mask use. Hospital cost data were used to estimate annual cost savings with the adoption of the semisterile technique. RESULTS In this study, 1,270 patients who underwent CRPP of a supracondylar humeral fracture and met inclusion criteria were identified. There were 3 deep infections (0.24%). These infections all occurred in the group using full sterile preparation and surgical masks. No clinically relevant pin-track infections were noted. There were no known surgeon occupational exposures to bodily fluid. It is estimated that national adoption of this technique in the United States could save between 18,612 and 22,162 gowns and masks with costs savings of $3.7 million to $4.4 million annually. CONCLUSIONS We currently face critical shortages of PPE due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from this large series suggest that a semisterile technique during CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures is a safe practice.

Our aim of this article is to review the current role of the ablative therapy in the management of CRLM patients. Main indications for thermal ablation include (I) unresectable liver lesions; (II) in combination with hepatectomy; (III) in patients with significant medical comorbidities or poor performance status (PS); (IV) a small (<3 cm) solitary lesion, which would otherwise necessitate a major liver resection; and (V) patient preference. There are several approaches and modalities for ablative therapy, including open, percutaneous, and laparoscopic approaches, as well as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA). Each approach and ablation modality have its own pros and cons. Percutaneous and laparoscopic approaches are preferred due to minimally invasive nature, yet laparoscopic approach has more benefits from thorough intraoperative ultrasound (US) exam as well as complete peritoneal staging with laparoscopy. Similarly, whereas high local tumor failure rate has been a major concern with RFA, MWA or microwave thermosphere ablation (MTA) have demonstrated significantly improved local tumor control due to homogenous tissue heating, ability to reach higher tissue temperatures, and less susceptible to the \"heat-sink\" effect. Although liver resection is the standard of care for CRLM, there have been some retrospective studies demonstrating similar oncological outcome between ablative therapy and surgical resection in very selected populations with small (<3 cm) solitary CRLM. Lastly, ablative therapy and liver resection should not be mutually exclusive, especially in the management of bilobar liver metastases. Concomitant ablative therapy with hepatectomy may spare the patients from having two-stage hepatectomy with less morbidity. The role of the thermal ablation will continue to evolve in patients with resectable and ablatable lesions owing to newly emerging technology, in addition to new systemic treatment options, including immunotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).","publish_time":1580515200000,"author_summary":" Takahashi, Hideo; Berber, Eren","abstract_summary":" With a recent randomized prospective trial<br>revealing that thermal ablative therapy as local tumor<br>control improved overall survival (OS) in patients<br>with unresectable colorectal cancer liver<br>metastases (CRLM), thermal ablation continues to remain<br>as an important treatment option in this patient<br>population.

METHODS Between September 2017 and December 2019 according to the selection criterions, 28 consecutive primary midline ventral hernias were repaired using TEA. After extensive endoscopic development of the midline extraperitoneal plane, which was started in the suprasymphysic area, and reduction of the hernia sac, the hernia defect was closed and a large mesh was placed in the preperitoneal position to enforce the anterior abdominal wall. RESULTS All operations were successfully performed without conversion to open surgery. The mean operation time was 103.3 min (range 85-145 min). Patient-reported postoperative pain was qualitatively mild with a mean pain visual analogue scale score of 1.9 on postoperative day 1. The average hospital stay was 1.9 days (range 1-3 days).

METHODS A prospective consecutive case series was conducted including all patients with a perforated duodenal ulcer who underwent a laparoscopic single-port repair at a single institution from January 2012 to June 2018. The operation was performed through a single port using conventional straight laparoscopic instruments and intra-corporeal knot tying techniques. RESULTS Out of 75 patients, simple closure of the perforation without omental patch was accomplished in 96% of cases. Conversion to an open operation was required in one patient (1.3%) due to a posterior duodenal perforation, and additional trocar placement was needed in another patient (1.3%). The mean incision length was 2.0 \u00b1 0.2 cm. The mean operation time was 63.0 \u00b1 26.6 min. Meantime a nasogastric tube remained in place was 2.9 \u00b1 0.8 days.

Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed a perforated, mixed type organoaxial\/mesoenteroaxial gastric volvulus within a giant hiatus hernia, with partial gastric outlet obstruction. The patient underwent laparoscopic reduction of hiatus hernia and gastric volvulus, conversion to laparotomy, and distal gastrectomy with Bilroth II reconstruction. An alendronate tablet was found in the right mediastinum. The patient had a prolonged post-operative course and was discharged home after completing extensive physical rehabilitation. DISCUSSION Bisphosphonates are widely used to treat metabolic bone disease, however can have devastating adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract.

METHODS Fifty-two patients with bilateral hernia were enrolled in this double-blind randomized controlled trial (NCT02023203). Each hernia, in the same patient, was randomized to implant LP-PTFE or SP-PPL mesh during totally extraperitoneal laparoscopic hernia repair. Patients were followed at 7 days, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 60 months after surgery. Visual analog scale (VAS) score was employed to evaluate the outcomes. Student's t test was used in case of normally distributed continuous variables, while the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used in case of not normally distributed variables. Chi square test was used for analysis of categorical variables. RESULTS Median VAS discomfort score with SP-PPL was significantly higher than LP-PTFE at 1 and 3 months after surgery (p = 0.003 in both cases). LP-PTFE showed significantly lower median score than SP-PPL at 7 days after surgery (p = 0.025) regarding pain at movement.

Thus, 347 cases were separated into 2 cohorts: mesh (n = 176) and standard dressing (n = 171). Demographics and risk factors were similar, except for age. Surgical and closure techniques were consistent in all patients. Delayed wound healing was assessed by the surgeon at the 2-week office visit for drainage, suture abscess, or wound edge separation.

For Jones' (zone 2) fractures, bone healing outcomes of conservative versus surgical treatment showed union rates of 77.4% versus 96.3%, refracture rates of 2.4% versus 2.1%, and mean time to union of 11.0 weeks versus 9.4 weeks, respectively. Only ten proximal diaphyseal (zone 3) fractures were reported, with a mean return to work of 8.2 weeks. CONCLUSION Acute zone 1 fractures are preferably treated conservatively as similar union rates were found after both conservative and surgical management. In contradistinction, acute zone 2 fractures demonstrate higher union rates and faster time to union when treated surgically. The outcomes of acute zone 3 fractures are rarely reported in the literature, so treatment recommendations remain unclear. Further research of proximal fifth metatarsal fractures is warranted to provide more definitive conclusions, but current findings can aid surgeons during the shared clinical decision making process.

METHODS Patients who underwent LPG-DFT or LSTG at the Cancer Institute Hospital in Tokyo between January 2006 and April 2015 were included in this retrospective study. Operative procedures were selected based on the distance from the cardia to the proximal boundary of the tumour, tumour location and predicted remnant stomach volume.

The main study outcome was nutritional status. RESULTS A total of 161 patients (LPG-DFT 51, LSTG 110) were included. Types of postoperative complication occurring more than 30 days after surgery differed between the two procedures. Remnant stomach ulcers, including anastomotic ulcers, were observed only after LPG-DFT, whereas complications involving the small intestine, such as internal hernia or small bowel obstruction, occurred more frequently after LSTG. Values for total protein, albumin, prealbumin and bodyweight loss were comparable between the two procedures at 36 months after surgery.

Germany has widely adopted postoperative protocols for pain management including oral opioids for rescue medication, but the effectiveness of such protocols has only been evaluated longitudinally in a before and after setting. The aim of this cohort analysis was to compare the effectiveness of an oral opioid rescue medication algorithm for postoperative management of pain to the gold standard of patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA). MATERIAL AND METHODS This study compared cohorts of patients of two prospective observational studies undergoing elective total hip replacement. After surgery patients received piritramide to achieve a pain score of \u22643 on the numeric rating scale (NRS 0-10). A protocol was started consisting of oral long-acting oxycodone and ibuprofen (basic analgesia). Cohort 1 (C1, 126 patients) additionally received an oral opioid rescue medication (hydromorphone) when reporting pain >3 on the NRS. Cohort 2 (C2, 88 patients) was provided with an opioid by PCIA (piritramide) for opioid rescue medication. Primary endpoints were pain intensity at rest, during movement, and maximum pain intensity within the first 24 h postoperative. Secondary endpoints were opioid consumption, functional outcome and patient satisfaction with pain management. RESULTS Pain during movement and maximum pain intensity were higher in C1 compared to C2: pain on movement median 1st-3rd quartile: 6 (3.75-8) vs. 5 (3-7), p = 0.023; maximum pain intensity: 7 (5-9) vs. 5 (3-8), p = 0.008. There were no differences in pain intensity at rest or between women and men in either group. The mean opioid consumption in all patients (combined PACU, baseline, and rescue medication; mean \u00b1 SD mg ME) was 126.6 \u00b1 51.8 mg oral ME (median 120 (87.47-154.25) mg ME). Total opioid consumption was lower in C1 than C2 (117 \u00b1 46 mg vs 140 \u00b1 56 mg, p = 0.002) due to differences in rescue opioids (C1: 57 \u00b1 37 mg ME, C2: 73 \u00b1 43 mg ME, p = 0.006, Z = -2.730). Basic analgesia opioid use was comparable (C1: 54 \u00b1 31 mg ME, C2: 60 \u00b1 36 mg ME, p = 0.288, Z = -1.063). There were no differences in respect to the addition of non-opioids and reported quality of mobilization, sleep, frequency of nausea and vomiting, or general satisfaction with pain management. CONCLUSION In this study PCIA provided a better reduction of pain intensity, when compared to a standardized protocol with oral opioid rescue medication. This effect was associated with increased opioid consumption. There were no differences in frequencies of opioid side effects. This study was a retrospective analysis of two cohorts of a major project. As with all retrospective studies, our analysis has several limitations to consider. Data can only represent the observation of clinical practice. It cannot reflect the quality of a statement of a randomized controlled trial.

The majority of patients had pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (n = 39, 52%) and cystic neoplasms (n = 23, 31%) with a median tumor size of 17 (3-60) mm. Nineteen (25.3%) patients underwent enucleation (robotic, n = 11; laparoscopic, n = 8) and 56 (74.7%) patients underwent distal pancreatic resection (robotic, n = 24; laparoscopic, n = 32), of those 48 (85%) underwent spleen-preserving procedures. Eight (10.7%) procedures had to be converted to open surgery. The rate of vessel preservation in distal pancreatectomy was significantly higher in robotic-assisted procedures (62.5% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.01). Twenty-six (34.6%) patients experienced postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade > 3). Twenty (26.7%) patients developed a pancreatic fistula type B. There was no mortality. After a median follow-up period of 58 months (range 2-120 months), one patient (1.3%) developed local recurrence (glucagonoma) after enucleation, which was treated with a Whipple procedure.

Of these patients, 30 and 51 patients underwent LRH and ORH, respectively. We analyzed surgical outcomes of LRH and ORH, focusing on tumor characteristics such as tumor size, location, distance from major vessels, and contralateral or ipsilateral tumor recurrence to determine what factors could affect surgical outcomes. Subsequently, using a propensity-matched cohort, we compared the impact of those factors on LRH and ORH outcomes. RESULTS In the entire cohort, the LRH operation time was significantly shorter in contralateral recurrent HCC cases than in ipsilateral recurrent HCC cases (252 vs. 398 min, P = 0.008); however, such a difference was not observed in the ORH operation time. We subsequently compared the surgical outcomes, in terms of the location of tumor recurrence, between the LRH and ORH groups in a propensity-matched cohort.

RESULTS The mean estimated blood loss (EBL) for the HALDN group was meaningfully higher than those of LESSOP-DN and MLDN (57.5\u00b152.2 mL versus 21.0\u00b130.0 mL versus 18.2\u00b128.7 mL) (P<0.001). The EBL for PLDN (53.3\u00b135.3 mL) was also significantly higher than those of LESSOP-DN and MLDN (P<0.001). Length of stay (LOS) for HALDN was longer than that for LESSOP-DN (4.2\u00b11.2 day versus 4.0\u00b11.4 days, P=0.002). There was 1 intraoperative open conversion in the HALDN group and 2 HALDN surgeries that required postoperative exploratory laparotomy. LESSOP-DN had 3 (0.8%) postoperative incisional hernias. For recipients, the results revealed no significant differences between all 4 groups in terms of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the 1-year graft failure rate.

We herein present our experience with laparoscopic IHR conducted using a single conventional port and a single working instrument. METHODS The records patients who underwent single conventional port intracorporeal IHR during November 2013-December 2018 were evaluated. The main outcome measurements were patient's demographic characteristics, hernia side, presence of incarceration, operative time, and complications. RESULTS A total of 132 inguinal hernias (52 right, 40 left, and 20 bilateral) were repaired in 112 patients (76 boys, 36 girls). The mean ages of the patients were 69.8 \u00b1 53.4 months (3 months to 17 years). In six patients, contralateral processus vaginalis was found to be patent during operation. Incarcerated inguinal hernia was present in two patients. Mean operative time was 17.9 \u00b1 3.8 min (9-30 min) in unilateral hernias and 28.9 \u00b1 6.5 min (24-45 min) in bilateral hernias. No intraoperative and postoperative complications were encountered. The mean hospital stay of the patients was 8.8 \u00b1 5.0 h (4-36 h).

Dexmedetomidine (DEX), an \u03b12-adrenoreceptor agonist, has been proven having lung protection effects. However, since now, there has not been final conclusion about whether DEX can reduce the incidence of PPCs. We hypothesize that, in oral and maxillofacial surgery with fibular free flap reconstruction patients, DEX may decrease the incidence of PPCs. METHODS This was a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-centered trial with two parallel arms. A total of 160 patients at intermediate-to-high risk of PPCs undergoing oral and maxillofacial surgery with fibular free flap reconstruction and tracheotomy were enrolled and randomized to receive continuous infusion of either DEX or placebo (normal saline). 0.4 \u03bcg\/kg of DEX was given over 10mins as an initial dose followed by a maintaining dose of 0.4 \u03bcg\/kg\/h till the second day morning after surgery. At the same time, the normal saline was administered a similar quantity. The primary outcome was the incidence of PPCs according to Clavien-Dindo score within 7 days after surgery. RESULTS The two groups had similar characteristics at baseline. 18(22.5%) of 80 patients administered DEX, and 32(40.0%) of 80 patient administered placebo experienced PPCs within the first 7 days after surgery (relative risk [RR] 0.563,95% confidence interval [CI] 0.346-0.916; P = 0.017). In the first 7 days after surgery, the DEX group had a lower incidence of PPCs and a better postoperative survival probability (Log-rank test, P = 0.019), and was less prone to occur PPCs (Cox regression, P = 0.025, HR = 0.516). When the total dose of DEX was more than 328 \u03bcg, the patients were unlikely to have PPCs (ROC curve, AUC = 0.614, P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS For patients undergoing oral and maxillofacial surgery with fibular free flap reconstruction and tracheotomy who were at intermediate or high risk of developing PPCs, continuous infusion of DEX could decrease the occurrence of PPCs during the first 7 days after surgery and shorten the length of hospital stay after surgery, but did not increase the prevalence of bradycardia or hypotension.

At first, this defect was closed primarily. To prevent perineal hernias, the use of a biological mesh to restore the pelvic floor has been increasing. The aim of this study, was to evaluate the outcome of the use of a biological mesh after ELAPE, APE or PE with\/without SR. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted on patients who had ELAPE, APE or PE with\/without SR with a biological mesh (Permacol\u2122) for pelvic reconstruction in rectal cancer in our center between January 2012 and April 2015. The endpoints were the incidence of perineal herniation and wound healing complications. RESULTS Data of 35 consecutive patients [22 men, 13 women; mean age 62 years (range 31-77 years)] were reviewed. Median follow-up was 24 months (range 0.4-64 months). Perineal hernia was reported in 3 patients (8.6%), and was asymptomatic in 2 of them. The perineal wound healed within 3 months in 37.1% (n = 13), within 6 months in 51.4% (n = 18) and within 1 year in 62.9% (n = 22). In 17.1% (n = 6), the wound healed after 1 year. It was not possible to confirm perineal wound healing in the remaining 7 patients (20.0%) due to death or loss to follow-up.

Incarcerated umbilical hernia was diagnosed on the basis of abdominal computed tomography, and the decision was made to perform emergency surgery. The patient was severely obese (body mass index, 53.8 kg\/m2), and the incarcerated portion of the hernia was therefore first addressed by open surgery. As bowel resection was unnecessary, the risk of infection was considered low, and after direct closure of the hernia orifice, IPOM was performed laparoscopically using the hybrid IPOM plus method. CONCLUSION Among severely obese patients, first trocar insertion is difficult and the wound site tends to come under strain, meaning that simple closure of the hernia orifice results in a high recurrence rate.

PURPOSE To determine the diagnostic accuracy of various physical examination tests in the diagnosis of CMI. STUDY DESIGN Cohort study (Diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3. METHODS A consecutive series of patients evaluated by the senior author with symptoms consistent with CMI were included. Four physical examination tests were routinely performed in these patients by the senior author and were noted in each patient's chart as positive or negative: (1) pain with resisted cross-body sit-up in figure-of-4 position, (2) pain with straight-leg sit-up, (3) pain with resisted hip flexion in external rotation (external rotation Stinchfield test), and (4) the presence of an adductor contracture. CMI was independently diagnosed by a reference standard (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). All MRI scans were read by a musculoskeletal fellowship-trained radiologist. The sensitivity and specificity of each physical examination test alone and in combination were calculated based on this reference standard. RESULTS A total of 81 patients were included in this study. MRI was positive for a CMI in 39 patients (48%) overall.

Multivariate analysis revealed that risk of excessive intraoperative bleeding (\u22651500 ml; odds ratio [OR] 0.27, 95%-confidence interval [CI] 0.10-0.70, p = 0.007), major morbidity (OR 0.41, 95%-CI 0.18-0.97, p = 0.041), and PHH (OR 0.22, 95%-CI 0.06-0.79, p = 0.021) were significantly lower in PM group after EH. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in 3-year recurrence-free-survival between groups. PM is associated with lower intraoperative bleeding, PHH, and major morbidity risk after EH. Performing PM does not increase posthepatectomy liver failure and does not affect recurrence rate. Therefore, PM seems to be justified in EH.","publish_time":1590969600000,"author_summary":" Al-Saeedi, Mohammed; Ghamarnejad, Omid;<br>Khajeh, Elias; Shafiei, Saeed; Salehpour, Roozbeh;<br>Golriz, Mohammad; Mieth, Markus; Weiss, Karl Heinz;<br>Longerich, Thomas; Hoffmann, Katrin; B\u00fcchler, Markus W;<br>Mehrabi, Arianeb","abstract_summary":" Despite the ongoing decades-long<br>controversy, Pringle maneuver (PM) is still frequently used<br>by hepatobiliary surgeons during hepatectomy.<br>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect<br>of PM on intraoperative blood loss, morbidity,<br>and posthepatectomy hemorrhage (PHH).

RESULTS Transductal LCBDE via choledochotomy was achieved in 242 patients (58.2%), whereas 174 patients (41.8%) underwent transcystic LCBDE. Stone clearance rates, conversion to open surgery and mortality were similar between the two groups.

Therefore, a specific newer generation MWA system, The Emprint\u2122 Ablation System with Thermosphere\u2122 Technology, was designed to create predictable large spherical zones of ablation that are not impacted by varying tissue environments. The time required for ablation with MWA systems is short, and the shape of the necrosis is elliptical with the older systems and spherical with the new system. In addition, because MWA has no heat-sink effect, it can be used to ablate tumors adjacent to major vessels. Although these factors yield a large ablation volume and result in good local control, excessive ablation of liver tissue and unexpected ablation of surrounding organs are possible. Therefore, MWA should be carefully performed. This review highlights the efficacy and complications of MWA performed with conventional systems and the newer generation system in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MWA with the newer generation system seems to be a promising treatment option for large HCCs and secondary hepatic malignancies, with several advantages over other available ablation techniques, including conventional MWA. However, further randomized controlled trials are necessary to fully clarify the benefits and pitfalls of this new system.","publish_time":1579478400000,"author_summary":" Imajo, Kento; Ogawa, Yuji; Yoneda, Masato;<br>Saito, Satoru; Nakajima, Atsushi","abstract_summary":" Although microwave ablation (MWA) exhibits a<br>high thermal efficiency, the major limitation of<br>conventional MWA systems is the lack of predictability of the<br>ablation zone size and shape.

Sixtyfive young patients (< 65 years) and 87 elderly patients (\u2265 65 years) were titrated on tapentadol extended release to their optimal dose (25-250 mg bid) over 1 month and, then, maintained at that dose for 3 months. The primary endpoint were changes from baseline in 24-h pain intensity on a 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at month-4 of treatment (titration plus maintenance periods). Patients were assessed for several efficacy and tolerability outcomes using a battery of scales and tests for neuropathic pain intensity, quality of life and sleep, and cognitive and gastrointestinal functions. RESULTS At pretreatment, young and elderly patients had similar pain intensities with younger patients presenting with more intense depressive and neuropathic pain symptoms, and lesser comorbidities and durations of pain (P < 0.05). Thirty-eight patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events occurring mostly during titration.

Conversion to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) following partial meniscectomy ranged from 11% to 54%, 31% to 35% for nonoperative, conservative treatment, and 0% to 1% for meniscal repair. Studies comparing repair with either meniscectomy or conservative treatment found greater improvement and slower progression of Kellgren-Lawrence grade with meniscal repair. A meta-analysis of the studies included in the systematic review using forest plots showed repair to have the greatest mean difference for functional outcomes (International Knee Documentation Committee and Lysholm Activity Scale) and the lowest change in follow-up joint space. Conclusions In patients who experience meniscal root tears, meniscal repair may provide the greatest improvement in function and lowest risk of conversion to TKA when compared with partial meniscectomy or conservative methods. Partial meniscectomy appears to provide no benefit over conservative treatment, placing patients at a high risk of requiring TKA in the near future.

Indocyanine green near-infrared video angiography (ICG-NIR-VA) has been adopted for objective assessment of free flap tissue perfusion but is thus far not used on a routine basis. Therefore, we investigated its intraoperative impact on decision-making and postoperative outcome. METHODS From January 2017 to June 2019, 88 consecutive adipo- or fasciocutaneus free flaps were performed in conjunction with intraoperative ICG-NIR-VA. Free flap tissue perfusion was first assessed clinically and then compared with ICG-NIR-VA findings. Based on the results, the decision for intraoperative trimming of critically perfused flap zones was made. The way of decision-making, flap success, and failure rates as well as intra- and postoperative complication rates were analyzed. RESULTS The overall free flap success rate was 92.0%. Partial flap necrosis occurred in five cases (5.7%) and total flap necrosis in two cases (2.3%). ICG-NIR-VA aided decision-making and flap design in 34 cases (38.6%) and led to complication-free postoperative courses. When ICG-NIR-VA was relied on (82 out of 88 flaps; 93.2%), there was no unpredicted postoperative tissue necrosis (overestimation). When ICG-NIR-VA was not relied on (6 out of 88 flaps; 6.8%), there were five cases of postoperative partial flap necrosis and one case of uneventful healing (underestimation). The sensitivity of ICG-NIR-VA was 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 64.6-100) and the specificity was 98.8% (95% CI: 93.3-100) with a positive predictive value of 87.5% (95% CI: 52.9-99.4) and a negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI: 95.4-100). CONCLUSION Intraoperative ICG-NIR-VA objectified free flap perfusion and thus refined surgical decision-making on flap design in all cases. It could always predict tissue necrosis and subjectively improved outcomes in free flap surgery at our institution. Furthermore, it could be easily implemented in intraoperative routine, only adding minimal additional operative time.","publish_time":1589414400000,"author_summary":" Bigdeli, Amir Khosrow; Thomas, Benjamin;<br>Falkner, Florian; Gazyakan, Emre; Hirche, Christoph;<br>Kneser, Ulrich","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND Reliable perfusion of the distal<br>portions of free flaps is decisive for the<br>reconstructive success.

DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation to appraise the certainty of evidence. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE The validated patient-reported Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles questionnaire. RESULTS 29 trials investigating 42 different treatments were included. 22 trials (76%) were at high risk of bias and 7 (24%) had some concerns. Most trials included patients with midportion tendinopathy (86%). Any treatment class seemed superior to wait-and-see for midportion Achilles tendinopathy at 3 months (very low to low certainty of evidence). At 12 months, exercise therapy, exercise+injection therapy and exercise+night splint therapy were all comparable with injection therapy for midportion tendinopathy (very low to low certainty). No network meta-analysis could be performed for insertional Achilles tendinopathy. SUMMARY\/CONCLUSION In our living network meta-analysis no trials were at low risk of bias and there was large uncertainty in the comparative estimates. For midportion Achilles tendinopathy, wait-and-see is not recommended as all active treatments seemed superior at 3-month follow-up. There seems to be no clinically relevant difference in effectiveness between different active treatments at either 3-month or 12-month follow-up. As exercise therapy is easy to prescribe, can be of low cost and has few harms, clinicians could consider starting treatment with a calf-muscle exercise programme.

To prevent recurrence, it is important to use the appropriate mesh size based on the size of the myopectineal orifice (MPO), which is the weak area of the abdominal wall where inguinal hernias occur. We aimed to estimate the appropriate mesh size for groin hernias by investigating MPO size. METHODS Four hundred and six patients underwent groin hernia repair using a totally extraperitoneal (TEP) approach at the Zeze Hospital between July 2009 and December 2017. We investigated patients' backgrounds, MPO components dimensions, and hernia recurrence, and evaluated the appropriate mesh size. RESULTS The 359 male and 47 female patients had an average age of 63 \u00b1 15 years. In 171, 147, and 88 cases, hernias were localized to the right, left, and bilaterally, respectively. The number of lateral, medial, femoral, and combined hernias was 317, 124, 11, and 42, respectively. The 95th percentile for the horizontal and vertical lengths in cases of hernia orifice \u2265 3 cm were 9.6 cm and 7.0 cm, respectively, while it was 9.2 cm and 6.4 cm in cases of hernia orifice < 3 cm.

RESULTS Twelve studies were included: one RCT, one prospective cohort, and 10 retrospective cohorts with a total of 1406 patients, of which 835 were treated operatively and 571 nonoperatively. Mean age ranged from 35 to 64, and 54% of the patients were male. The cohort studies had, in general, moderate bias while the RCT had a low bias. There were statistically significant fewer nonunions in the operative treated group with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.49 (0.35-0.67) yielding a number needed to treat (NNT) = 12.

METHODS We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate one-year costs and outcomes of robotic, laparoscopic, and open proctectomy based on data from the available literature. The robustness of our results was tested with one-way and multi-way sensitivity analyses. RESULTS Open proctectomy had increased cost and lower quality of life (QOL) compared with laparoscopy and robotic approaches. In the societal perspective, robotic proctectomy costs $497\/case more than laparoscopy, with minimal QOL improvements, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $751,056 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). In the healthcare sector perspective, robotic proctectomy resulted in $983\/case more and an ICER of $1,485,139\/QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated factors influencing cost-effectiveness primarily pertained to the operative cost and the postoperative length of stay (LOS). In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the cost-effective approach to proctectomy was laparoscopic in 42% of cases, robotic in 39%, and open in 19% at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $100,000\/QALY. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic and robotic proctectomy cost less and have higher QALY than the open approach. Based on current data, laparoscopy is the most cost-effective approach. Robotic proctectomy can be cost-effective if modest differences in costs or postoperative LOS can be achieved.","publish_time":1589155200000,"author_summary":" Simianu, Vlad V; Curran, Thomas; Gaertner,<br>Wolfgang B; Sklow, Bradford; Kuntz, Karen M; Kwaan, Mary<br>R; Madoff, Robert D; Jensen, Christine C","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND Robotic surgery is increasingly<br>used for proctectomy, but the cost-effectiveness<br>of this approach is uncertain.

The study aims to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of our technique of robotic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (RSPDP) by a stepwise approach. METHODS The data of consecutive patients presented for RSPDP from 2014 to 2019 at Verona University were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. The patients were divided into two groups based on the surgical procedure performed, such as Kimura's (KG) or Warshaw's (WG) technique, and then compared. RESULTS In the study period, 32 patients underwent RSPDP. Twenty-three patients presented for the Kimura procedure (72%), while nine patients underwent the Warshaw procedure (28%). A higher body mass index was found in the KG (26 \u00b1 4 vs. 22 \u00b1 3, p = 0.037). Regarding the pathological data, the WG group differed in the tumor dimension, and the lymph nodes harvested (30 \u00b1 2 vs. 17 \u00b1 10, 9 \u00b1 5 vs. 3 \u00b1 4, p = 0.0028, and p = 0.005, respectively).

Patients who had distant metastasis, multiple malignancies, intestinal obstruction or perforation, or a clinical complete response to chemoradiotherapy were excluded. Postoperative results, including morbidity, circumferential resection margin (CRM) assessment, short-term survival and functional outcomes, were analysed. RESULTS Thirty-eight patients, with 25 mid and 13 low rectal tumours, who had elective resection by TaTME from March 2015 to September 2018 were included. There were 25 men and 13 women. Mean(s.d.) age was 58\u00b72(16\u00b74) years and mean(s.d.) BMI was 24\u00b72(2\u00b75) kg\/m2 . Tumours were 3-9 cm from the anal verge. Mean(s.d.) duration of surgery was 210(42) min. All patients had hand-sewn anastomoses and protective ileostomies. There were no conversions, abdominal perineal resections or postoperative deaths. Four patients had a complication, including three presacral abscesses, all managed by transanastomotic drainage. At 3 months after ileostomy closure, all patients had perfect continence. Apart from a greater tumour diameter in patients with low rectal cancers (6\u00b70 cm versus 4\u00b76 cm in those with mid rectal tumours; P = 0\u00b7035), clinical features were similar in the two groups. CRM positivity was greater for low than for mid rectal tumours (3 of 13 versus 0 of 25 respectively; P = 0\u00b7034), and more patients with a low tumour had TME grade 2 (4 of 13 versus 1 of 25; P = 0\u00b7038).

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level 4. METHODS A total of 57 scholastic athletes with primary anterior shoulder instability who were managed nonoperatively were reviewed. Success was defined as a return to index sport at the same level and playing at least 1 subsequent season without missed time as a result of the shoulder. Patient-specific risk factors were individually evaluated, and odds ratios were calculated. A 10-point Nonoperative Injury Severity Index Score (NISIS) incorporated the risk factors for failure. This score was then retrospectively applied with regression analysis and a chi-square analysis to determine the overall optimal score that predicted failure of nonoperative management. RESULTS In total, 6 risk factors for failure were included in the NISIS: age (>15 years), bone loss, type of instability, type of sport (contact vs noncontact), male sex, and arm dominance. Overall, 79% of patients treated nonoperatively were able to successfully return to sport. Nearly all (97%) low-risk patients (NISIS <7) successfully returned to sport, while only 59% of high-risk patients returned to sport, a relative risk of 12.2 (P = 0.001).

CASE SUMMARY A 54-year-old woman who chiefly complained of a 10-year history of a reversible bulge in her right sacrococcygeal region was admitted to our hospital. The physical examination revealed a bulge in the right sacrococcygeal region upon standing, which disappeared in the prone position but relapsed when performing the Valsalva manoeuvre. Computed tomography displayed an abnormality in the structure of the tissues between the midline of the sacrococcygeal region and the right gluteus muscle. The patient was diagnosed with sacrococcygeal hernia and received hernia repair with mesh through a combined laparoscopic and sacrococcygeal approach. On laparoscopy, the rectum was dissected posterolaterally, and a defect was identified in the right anterior sacrococcygeal region through which part of the rectum protruded. This was followed by the placement of a self-gripping polyester mesh via a sacrococcygeal approach. There were no postoperative complications. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 7 and was followed for more than 6 mo with no recurrence. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic mesh repair is recommended as a priority of surgical options for sacrococcygeal hernias, while choosing a self-gripping mesh can help avoid the risk of presacral vessel injury by reducing suture fixation.","publish_time":1579996800000,"author_summary":" Dong, Yuan-Qiang; Liu, Li-Jia; Fu, Zan; Chen,<br>Si-Meng","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND Sacrococcygeal hernia is a very<br>rare condition that is usually secondary to<br>sacrococcygectomy, and its ideal treatment regimen is unclear.<br>Herein, we report a case of sacrococcygeal hernia<br>occurring in a patient who had no history of<br>sacrococcygeal operation, present the operative procedures<br>of mesh repair via a combined laparoscopic and<br>sacrococcygeal approach that has not been described, and<br>discuss our experience in diagnosis and treatment with<br>a review of the literature.

METHODS We performed purely laparoscopic anatomical segmentectomy using the transfissural Glissonean approach. This approach involved initially opening the liver parenchyma along the fissure line (main portal, right portal, and umbilical fissures). Thereafter, the target tertiary portal pedicles were approached and ligated within the liver parenchyma above the liver hilum. RESULTS Between August 2014 and September 2019, we performed 17 cases of laparoscopic anatomical segmentectomy using the transfissural Glissonean approach. The median operative time was 200 min (range 120-310 min), and the intraoperative blood loss was 80 mL (range 30-280 mL). The median postoperative hospital stay was 6 days (range 3-9 days).

METHODS PubMed, Ovid, the Cochrane Library database and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched. All of the statistical analyses were performed using Revman software.

Anastomotic leak occurred in 3.5% (17\/491) of the cases where 1 stapler firing was used versus 6.7% (50\/786) of the cases in which 2 firings were needed (50\/786).

Rates of TO were assessed over time. Factors associated with achieving a TO and the impact of TO on long-term survival were examined. RESULTS Among 1829 patients, 944 (51.6%) and 885 (48.4%) individuals underwent curative-intent resection for HCC and ICC, respectively. Over time, patients were older, more frequently had ASA class > 2, albumin-bilirubin grade 2\/3, major vascular invasion and more frequently underwent major liver resection (all p < 0.05). Overall, a total of 1126 (62.0%) patients achieved a TO. No increasing trends in TO rates were noted over the years (ptrend = 0.90). In addition, there was no increasing trend in the TO rates among patients undergoing either major (ptrend = 0.39) or minor liver resection (ptrend = 0.63) over the study period.

However, due to limited resources, re-assessment of treatment paradigms in the wake of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is urgently required.

METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted for articles published between January 1, 2010 and April 1, 2020 on MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL. Studies were included if they contained patients with OSCC treated with either neoadjuvant, induction, or definitive radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or combination thereof, and an outcome of overall survival. RESULTS: In total, 36 articles were identified. Definitive radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy were the focus of 18 articles and neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy were the focus of the other 18 articles. In early stage OSCC, definitive radiotherapy, with or without concurrent chemotherapy, was associated with a significantly increased hazard of death compared to definitive surgery (HR: 2.39, 95% CI: 1.56 - 3.67, I(2): 63%). The hazard of death was non-significantly increased with definitive chemoradiotherapy in studies excluding early disease (HR: 1.98, 95% CI: 0.85 - 4.64, I(2): 84%). Two recent randomized control trials have been conducted, demonstrating no survival advantage to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that primary radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy are inferior to surgical management for OSCC.

METHODS: An online survey was conducted of participants with breast, lung, or colorectal cancer who had received chemotherapy treatment within the past 12 months, and had experienced at least one episode of myelosuppression in the past year. The survey was administered with predominantly close-ended questions, and lay definitions of key terms were provided to aid response selection. RESULTS: Of 301 participants who completed the online survey, 153 (51%) had breast cancer, 100 (33%) had lung cancer, and 48 (16%) had colorectal cancer. Anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia were reported by 61%, 59%, 37%, and 34% of participants, respectively.

Abdominal closure complications are strongly associated with suture technique and material, in addition to other factors related to the patient and type of surgery performed. The traditional technique is to place the fascia sutures 1 cm apart and at least 1 cm away from the fascia edge. A Swedish study described a new technique of placing the sutures 5 mm apart and 5 mm away from the fascia edge, resulting in lower rates of abdominal wound complications. This study has a number of limitations. There is a need for improved quality evidence to convince the surgical community to change the closure technique of abdominal wounds aiming to reduce morbidity, which is exemplified in incisional hernias and other various postop complications. METHODS: This is a 1:1 randomized, controlled, patient- and assessor-blinded, parallel design, superiority trial, with a primary endpoint of incisional hernia at 1 year. The study will be conducted at AUBMC over a 3-year period. Patients planned for a non-emergent midline laparotomy for general surgery or vascular procedure will be randomized to either fascia closure technique. In order to detect a drop of 12% in the incidence of incisional hernia, with 80% power and an alpha of 0.05, we will need to recruit 114 patients per arm. After adjusting for loss to follow-up, target recruitment is 274 subjects. We will compare both arms for the primary, secondary, and exploratory outcomes, using chi-square or t test as appropriate. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression will be done. DISCUSSION: This trial will assess postop complications following abdominal midline wound closures via two different suturing techniques. This trial will generate evidence-based conclusions that will allow surgeons to assess the role of a new abdominal closure technique in decreasing short- and long-term postoperative complications, for a commonly performed procedure.

METHODS: Patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (8th edition) stage I\u2013IV MCC treated at our institution were identified (1\/1\/2008\u20132\/28\/2018). The first site of metastasis was classified as regional [regional lymph node (LN) basin, in-transit] or distant. Distant metastasis-free (DMFS) and MCC-specific (MSS) survival were estimated. RESULTS: Of 133 patients, 64 (48%) had stage I, 13 (10%) stage II, 48 (36%) stage III, and 8 (6%) stage IV disease at presentation. The median follow-up time in patients who remained alive was 36 (interquartile range 20\u201366) months. Regional or distant metastases developed in 78 (59%) patients. The first site was regional in 87%, including 73% with isolated LN involvement, and distant in 13%. Thirty-seven (28%) patients eventually developed distant disease, which most commonly involved the abdominal viscera (51%) and distant LNs (46%) first.

Results: A total of 451 patients (mean age, 63.9 \u00b1 13.9 years) were included. At treatment, mean largest basal tumor diameter (LBD) and thickness were 10.3 \u00b1 2.8 mm (range, 3.0\u201323.0) and 4.3 mm (range, 1.0\u201317.0). All but one (0.2%) had MOLES scores of \u22653.

Presentation of case. A 42-year old man was hospitalized for Covid-19 pneumonia. Fever, respiratory symptoms and hypoxemia significantly improved over the next 2 weeks, but the patient developed abdominal pain, nausea, and low-grade fever. Computed tomography scan revealed absence of contrast enhancement of gallbladder wall and a micro-perforation of the fundus. At laparoscopy, gallbladder gangrene was confirmed and a subtotal cholecystectomy performed. Special precautions were adopted for patient transportation from the ward to a dedicated operating room, and two teams with adequate personal protective equipment took charge of the procedure.

It is unknown whether a prothrombotic state induced by COVID-19 contributes to wall ischemia and perforation. Percutaneous cholecystostomy should be avoided in patients with gallbladder gangrene. Contraindications to laparoscopy are not evidence-based since aerosolization is produced during both open and laparoscopic surgical procedures. However, personal protective equipment is key for prevention CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis and surgical therapy are critical in patients with gangrenous cholecystitis. Subtotal laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gangrenous gallbladder is safe and effective.","publish_time":1592006400000,"author_summary":" Lovece, Andrea; Asti, Emanuele; Bruni,<br>Barbara; Bonavina, Luigi","abstract_summary":" INTRODUCTION: Management of acute abdomen<br>during COVID-19 pandemic may be challenging.<br>Presentation of case.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the superiority of PEGylated G-CSF for CIN in breast cancer in terms of effectiveness and safety via a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was performed for eligible studies published from database inception to December 2019. All studies comparing PEGylated G-CSF and G-CSF for CIN of breast cancer were reviewed. After literature selection, data extraction and quality assessment were performed by two reviewers independently. Meta-analysis was conducted using Revman, version 5.2. RESULTS: Nine randomized controlled trials were finally identified. The publication bias of these studies was acceptable. For the endpoint of effectiveness, analysis of the incidence\/duration of grade \u2265 3 neutropenia, the duration of grade 4 neutropenia, the incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN), and the time to absolute neutrophil count recovery showed no advantage of PEGylated G-CSF over G-CSF for CIN of breast cancer (P > 0.05), with the premise of a sufficient dose of G-CSF according to the guidelines. No significant differences in grade 4 adverse events were observed between the groups (P = 0.29), and PEGylated G-CSF did not increase the incidence of skeletal and\/or muscle pain compared with G-CSF (P = 0.32). CONCLUSION: PEGylated G-CSF was as effective and safe as G-CSF to reduce CIN in breast cancer but did not show an obvious superiority.

As there is currently no randomized evidence comparing hypofractionated (HFRT) and conventionally-fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT), the aim of this study was to compare overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and toxicity of HFRT and CFRT in LS-SCLC. Methods LS-SCLC patients treated between 2000-2013 with HFRT (40Gy\/15, 45Gy\/15, 45Gy\/20 fractions) or CFRT (60Gy\/30 or 66Gy\/33 fractions) were included. Propensity scores were generated using a multivariable logistic regression model. Patients were matched on a 1:1 ratio with a caliper distance of 0.20. OS and PFS were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank tests. As a sensitivity analysis, univariable and multivariable Cox regression was performed including all patients without matching. Logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of pulmonary and esophageal adverse events. Results In the overall group of 117 patients, there were significant baseline differences between the HFRT and CFRT cohorts. Patients who received CFRT were older, smoked more often concurrently with treatment, had higher ECOG performance status, different T and N stage patterns, and more commonly received concurrent chemoradiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation. After propensity score matching for these differences, 72 patients were included, 36 in the HFRT and CFRT cohorts respectively. There was no difference in OS (P=0.724), PFS (P=0.862), any pulmonary (P=0.350), or esophageal (P=0.097) adverse events between cohorts. Skin adverse events were significantly higher for CFRT (41.7%) compared with HFRT (16.7%, P=0.020). Multivariable Cox regression also revealed no differences in OS (P=0.886) or PFS (P=0.717) between all HFRT and CFRT patients, without matching. No grade 5 adverse events were observed. Conclusion In LS-SCLC patients, HFRT was associated with comparable survival and toxicity outcomes and may be considered as an alternative to CFRT, should its efficacy be confirmed in prospective studies.","publish_time":1592006400000,"author_summary":" Zayed, Sondos; Chen, Hanbo; Ali, Emma;<br>Rodrigues, George B.; Warner, Andrew; Palma, David A.;<br>Louie, Alexander V.","abstract_summary":" ABSTRACT Introduction Various radiation<br>schedules are used in concurrent chemoradiotherapy for<br>limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC).

A microsurgical diamond tip was used to create a 1-2 mm starting point for each retropreparation. A 25\/06 and 30\/06 VTaper 2H (SS White, Lakewood, NJ) were bent at a about 90-degree angle to mimic the clinical and anatomical restrictions and used to create a retropreparation to a depth of 14-mm. Micro-CT scans were taken and analyzed for volume and percentage of residual obturation material at 5- and 10-mm. Additionally, the incidence of instrument separation and crack and ledge formation in the teeth were recorded. RESULTS: The median volume of residual obturation at 5- and 10-mm was 0.18 mm(3) (interquartile range of 0.36 mm(3)), and 1.97 mm(3) (interquartile range of 1.99 mm(3)) respectively. The overall incidence of file separation during retropreparation was 13.33% (4\/30). Among the cases analyzed with micro-CT, none showed crack or ledge formation. CONCLUSIONS: Retroinstrumentation of surgically resected roots using controlled memory files cleans the canal effectively with relatively low adverse treatment outcomes. This novel technique, while limited in application, is a safe and effective way to achieve a deep, clean retropreparation.","publish_time":1592179200000,"author_summary":" Hatzke, Matthew W.; Daigle, Francesca C.;<br>Augsburger, Robert A.; Kesterke, Matthew J.; Jalali,<br>Poorya","abstract_summary":" INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to<br>evaluate the amount of residual obturation material of<br>retroinstrumented surgically resected roots using controlled<br>memory (CM) files and to evaluate the incidence of<br>adverse treatment outcomes.

METHODS: HNSCC cases (oropharynx\/larynx\/hypopharynx) treated with definitive RT\u2010hypo (60 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks), moderately accelerated radiotherapy (RT\u2010acc) alone (70 Gy in 35 fractions over 6 weeks), or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) during 2005\u20102017 were included. Locoregional control (LRC) and distant control (DC) after RT\u2010hypo, RT\u2010acc, and CCRT were compared for various subgroups. RESULTS: The study identified 994 human papillomavirus\u2013positive (HPV+) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma cases (with 61, 254, and 679 receiving RT\u2010hypo, RT\u2010acc, and CCRT, respectively) and 1045 HPV\u2013 HNSCC cases (with 263, 451, and 331 receiving RT\u2010hypo, RT\u2010acc, and CCRT, respectively). The CCRT cohort had higher T\/N categories, whereas the radiotherapy\u2010alone patients were older. The median follow\u2010up was 4.6 years.

Although LRC was also similar for T4\/N3 disease (78%, 84%, and 88%; P = .677), DC was significantly lower with RT\u2010hypo or RT\u2010acc versus CCRT (67%, 65%, and 87%; P = .005). For HPV\u2013 HNSCC, 3\u2010year LRC and DC were similar with RT\u2010hypo, RT\u2010acc, and CCRT in stages I and II (LRC, 85%, 89%, and 100%; P = .320; DC, 99%, 98%, and 100%; P = .446); however, RT\u2010hypo and RT\u2010acc had significantly lower LRC in stage III (76%, 69%, and 91%; P = .006), whereas DC rates were similar (92%, 85%, and 90%; P = .410). Lower LRC in stage III predominated in patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma receiving RT\u2010acc (62%) but not RT\u2010hypo (80%) or CCRT (92%; RT\u2010hypo vs CCRT: P = .270; RT\u2010acc vs CCRT: P = .004).

The purpose of this study is to report the surgical outcomes of a series of laparoscopic-assisted myomectomy (LAM) cases at a freestanding ambulatory surgery center (ASC), including a comparative analysis of outcomes in morbidly obese patients (BMI > 40 kg\/m(2)). METHODS: A retrospective comparative analysis was performed of 969 women, age 18 years or older, non-pregnant, who underwent LAM by one of two high volume, laparoscopic gynecologic surgical specialists at a freestanding ambulatory surgery center serving the Washington, DC area, between October 2013 and February 2019. Reversible occlusion was performed laparoscopically by placing a latex-based rubber catheter as a tourniquet around the isthmus of the uterus, causing a temporary occlusion of the bilateral uterine arteries. Permanent occlusion was performed laparoscopically via retroperitoneal dissection and uterine artery ligation at the origin of the anterior branch of the internal iliac artery. Minilaparotomy was performed for specimen removal in all cases. No power morcellation was used. Postoperative complications were graded using the Clavien-Dindo Classification system. Outcomes were compared across BMI categories using Pearson Chi-Square. RESULTS: Average myoma weight and size were 422.7 g and 8.3 cm, respectively. Average estimated blood loss (EBL) was 192.1 mL; intraoperative and grade 3 postoperative complication rates were 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively. While EBL was significantly higher in obese and morbidly obese patients, this difference was not clinically meaningful, with no significant difference in blood transfusion rates. There were no statistically significant intraoperative or postoperative complication rates across BMI categories. There was a low rate of hospital transfers (0.7%) for all patients. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic-assisted myomectomy can be performed safely in a freestanding ambulatory surgery setting, including morbidly obese patients.

RESULTS: 102 patients were identified at our institution from 2003 to 2015. 20 recurrences were detected by symptoms, while 62 recurrences were diagnosed first by asymptomatic rise in CA-125, 5 by pelvic exam, and 15 by imaging in the absence of known exam abnormality or rise in CA-125. Mean time to recurrence was 18.9 months, and median survival was 45.8 months. These did not vary by recurrence detection method (all p > 0.4). Patients whose disease was detected by CA-125 were less likely to undergo SCS than those detected by other means (21.7% vs. 35.0%, p = 0.007). In addition to the 5 patients whose recurrence was detected primarily by pelvic exam, an additional 10 (total n = 15) patients had an abnormal pelvic exam at time of diagnosis of recurrence. DISCUSSION: Recurrence detection method was not associated with differing rates of survival or optimal SCS, however those patients detected by CA-125 were less likely to undergo SCS. The pelvic exam was a useful tool for detecting a significant proportion of recurrences.","publish_time":1591142400000,"author_summary":" Richardson, M.T.; Routson, S.; Karam, A.;<br>Dorigo, O.; Levy, K.; Renz, M.; Diver, E.J.","abstract_summary":" OBJECTIVE: To investigate the utility of<br>asymptomatic screening, including CA-125, imaging, and<br>pelvic exam, in the diagnosis and management of<br>recurrent ovarian cancer.
