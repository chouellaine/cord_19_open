We present a general framework for characterizing epidemiological delays based on cohorts (i.e., a group of individuals that share the same event time, such as symptom onset) and show that forward-looking serial intervals, which correctly link R with r, are not the same as \"intrinsic\" serial intervals, but instead change with r.To facilitate research and informed policy-making, particularly in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak, we are releasing an open-source implementation of our framework at https://github.com/covid19-model.Generation intervals, defined as the time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person, link two key quantities that describe an epidemic: the initial reproductive number, [Formula: see text] , and the initial rate of exponential growth, r. Generation intervals can be measured through contact tracing by identifying who infected whom.When calibrating our corresponding model to empirical estimates of the transmission rate and the number of days being contagious, we find $D_c\\sim 7.2$. Assuming realistic contact networks with a degree of about 5, and assuming that lockdown measures would reduce that to household-size (about 2.5), we reproduce actual infection curves with a remarkable precision, without fitting or fine-tuning of parameters.They are often used interchangeably, leading to misunderstanding of how these intervals link the epidemic growth rate r and the reproduction number R.
