The study of bNAbs arising in natural infection is essential in this endeavor. We generated a human antibody, 8D6, recognizing the E2 protein of HCV isolated from a chronic hepatitis C patient. This antibody shows broadly neutralizing activity, which covers a pan-genotypic panel of cell culture-derived HCV virions (HCVcc). Functional and epitope analyses demonstrated that 8D6 can block the interaction between E2 and CD81 by targeting a highly conserved epitope on E2. We describe how the 8D6 lineage evolved via somatic hypermutation to achieve broad neutralization. We found that the V(D)J recombination-generated junctional and somatic hypermutation-induced disulfide bridge (C-C) motif in the CDRH3 is critical for the broad neutralization and binding activity of 8D6. This motif is conserved among a series of broadly neutralizing HCV antibodies, indicating a common binding model. Next, the 8D6 inferred germline (iGL) was reconstructed and tested for its binding affinity and neutralization activity. Interestingly, 8D6 iGL-mediated relatively strong inhibition of the 1b genotype PR79L9 strain, suggesting that PR79L9 may serve as a potential natural viral strain that provides E2 sequences that induce bNAbs. Overall, our detailed epitope mapping and genetic studies of the HCV E2-specific mAb 8D6 have allowed for further refinement of antigenic sites on E2 and reveal a new mechanism to generate a functional CDRH3, while its iGL can serve as a probe to identify potential HCV vaccine strains.","publish_time":1585612800000,"author_summary":" Yi, Chunyan; Xia, Jing; He, Lan; Ling, Zhiyang;<br>Wang, Xuesong; Yan, Yu; Wang, Jiangjun; Zhao,<br>Xinhao; Fan, Weiguo; Sun, Xiaoyu; Zhang, Ronghua; Ye,<br>Sheng; Zhang, Rongguang; Xu, Yongfen; Ma, Liyan;<br>Zhang, Yaguang; Zhou, Honglin; Huang, Zhong; Niu,<br>Junqi; Long, Gang; Lu, Junxia; Zhong, Jin; Sun, Bing","abstract_summary":" Induction of broadly neutralizing monoclonal<br>antibodies (bNAbs) that bind to the viral envelope<br>glycoproteins is a major goal of hepatitis C virus (HCV)<br>vaccine research.

The S2 domain mediates viral fusion with the host cell membrane. Experience with SARS and MERS coronavirus has shown that potent monoclonal neutralizing antibodies against the RBD can inhibit the interaction with the virus cellular receptor (ACE2 for SARS) and block the virus cell entry. Assuming that a similar strategy would be successful against SARS-CoV-2, we used phage display to select from the human na\u00efve universal antibody gene libraries HAL9\/10 anti SARS2 spike antibodies capable of inhibiting interaction with ACE2. 309 unique fully human antibodies against S1 were identified. 17 showed more than 75% inhibition of spike binding to cells expressing ACE2, assessed by flow cytometry and several antibodies showed even an 50% inhibition at a molar ratio of the antibody to spike protein or RBD of 1:1. Furthermore, these antibodies neutralized active SARS-Cov-2 virus infection of VeroE6 cells. All 17 were all able to bind the isolated RBD, four of them with sub-nanomolar EC50. Epitope analysis of the antibodies revealed that six bind at the RBD-ACE2 interface and two on the opposite side of the domain. Universal libraries from healthy donors offer the advantage that antibodies can be generated quickly and independent from the availability of material from recovered patients in a pandemic situation.","publish_time":1591315200000,"author_summary":" Bertoglio, Federico; Meier, Doris;<br>Langreder, Nora; Steinke, Stephan; Rand, Ulfert;<br>Simonelli, Luca; Heine, Philip Alexander; Ballmann,<br>Rico; Schneider, Kai-Thomas; Ralph Roth, Kristian<br>Daniel; Ruschig, Maximilian; Riese, Peggy; Eschke,<br>Kathrin; Kim, Yeonsu; Sch\u00e4ckermann, Dorina; Pedotti,<br>Mattia; Kuhn, Philipp; Zock-Emmenthal, Susanne;<br>W\u00f6hrle, Johannes; Becker, Marlies; Grasshoff,<br>Martina; Wenzel, Esther Veronika; Russo, Giulio;<br>Kr\u00f6ger, Andrea; Brunotte, Linda; Ludwig, Stephan;<br>F\u00fchner, Viola; Kr\u00e4mer, Stefan Daniel; D\u00fcbel, Stefan;<br>Varani, Luca; Roth, G\u00fcnter; \u010ci\u010din-\u0160ain, Luka;<br>Schubert, Maren; Hust, Michael","abstract_summary":" COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory disease<br>caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel betacoronavirus<br>discovered in December 2019 and closely related to the SARS<br>coronavirus (CoV).

Importantly, patients with critical COVID-19 demonstrated the strongest T-cell response, including the highest frequencies of cytokine-producing bi- and trifunctional T-cells, for all three proteins. Although the higher magnitude and superior functionality of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells in critical patients can also be a result of a stronger immunogenicity provided by severe infection, it disproves the hypothesis of insufficient SARS-CoV-2-reactive immunity in critical COVID-19. To this end, activation of effector T-cells with differentiated memory phenotype found in our study could cause hyper-reactive response in critical cases leading to immunopathogenesis.

In this work, a competitive biopanning strategy of a phage display antibody library was applied to screen blocking antibodies against RBD. High-affinity antibodies were enriched after the first round using a standard panning process in which RBD-His recombinant protein was immobilized as a bait. At the next two rounds, immobilized ACE2-Fc and free RBD-His proteins were mixed with the enriched phage antibodies. Antibodies binding to RBD at epitopes different from ACE2-binding site were captured by the immobilized ACE2-Fc, forming a \u201csandwich\u201d complex. Only antibodies competed with ACE2 for recognizing RBD at the same or similar epitopes can bind to the free RBD-His in the supernatant and be subsequently separated by the Ni-NTA magnetic beads. Top 1 lead from the competitive biopanning of a synthetic antibody library, Lib AB1, was produced as the full-length IgG1 format. It was proved to competitively block the binding of RBD to ACE2 protein, and potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of ACE2-overexpressing Hela cells with IC50 values of 12nM.

The spike (S) homotrimers bind to their receptors through the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is believed to be a major target to block viral entry. In this study, we selected Alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) and Beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) as models. Their RBDs were observed to adopt two different conformational states (lying or standing).

SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike protein, in particular the receptor binding domain (RBD), to bind human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry, and thus targeting RBD holds the promise for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, a competitive biopanning strategy of a phage display antibody library was applied to screen blocking antibodies against RBD. High-affinity antibodies were enriched after the first round using a standard panning process in which RBD-His was immobilized as a bait. At the next two rounds, immobilized ACE2-Fc and free RBD-His were mixed with the enriched phage antibodies. Antibodies binding to RBD at epitopes different from ACE2-binding site were captured by the immobilized ACE2-Fc, forming a \u201csandwich\u201d complex. Only antibodies competed with ACE2 can bind to the free RBD-His in the supernatant and be subsequently separated by the Ni-NTA magnetic beads. Top 1 lead from the competitive biopanning of our synthetic antibody library, Lib AB1, was produced as the full-length IgG1 format. It was proved to competitively block the binding of RBD to ACE2 and potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection with IC(50) values of 12 nM. Nevertheless, top 1 lead from the standard biopanning can only bind to RBD in vitro, but not have the blocking or neutralization activity. Our strategy can efficiently isolate the blocking antibodies of RBD, and it would speed up the discovery of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":1588204800000,"author_summary":" Zeng, Xin; Li, Lingfang; Lin, Jing; Li, Xinlei;<br>Liu, Bin; Kong, Yang; Zeng, Shunze; Du, Jianhua;<br>Xiao, Huahong; Zhang, Tao; Zhang, Shelin; Liu,<br>Jianghai","abstract_summary":" The infection of the novel coronavirus<br>SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 200,000 deaths, but no<br>vaccine or therapeutic monoclonal antibody is<br>currently available.
