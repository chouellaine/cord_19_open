{"cluster": 7, "subcluster": 35, "abstract_summ": " Given a regular language L over an ordered alphabet, the set of lexicographically smallest (resp., largest) words of each length is itself regular . We prove that if L is recognized by a DFA with n states, then [Formula: see text] states are sufficient . We give a matching lower bound that holds even if S(L) is represented as an NFA . We show that well-formedness of a context-free language is decidable in polynomial time ."}
