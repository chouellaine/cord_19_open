We predicted confirmed daily cases and cumulative numbers for June 6th to June 26th with 80%, 95% and 99% prediction intervals (PI).RESULTS: Cumulative infection and spreadability rate predicted by the model was in good agreement with the actual observed data for all countries (R(2) = 0.985121 to 0.999635, and MD = 1.2\u20137.76%) except Iran (R(2) = 0.996316, and MD = 18.38%).METHOD: a mathematical and epidemiological model of susceptible, infected, and recovered cases was applied to the nine Brazilian capitals with the highest number of cases of the infection.", "title_summ": "Data-driven modelling and prediction of COVID-19 infection in India and correlation analysis of the virus transmission with socio-economic factorsEstimation and prediction of COVID-19 cases in Brazilian metropolisesProjecting the Course of COVID-19 in Turkey: A Probabilistic Modeling Approach.", "title_abstract_phrases": "METHODS: Actual cumulative infected population data from 15 February to May 15, 2020 was used for determination of parameters of a nested exponential statistical model, which were further employed for the prediction of infection.Estimation and prediction of COVID-19 cases in Brazilian metropolisesOBJECTIVE: to estimate the transmission rate, the epidemiological peak, and the number of deaths by the new coronavirus.Data-driven modelling and prediction of COVID-19 infection in India and correlation analysis of the virus transmission with socio-economic factorsAIMS: The current study attempts to model the COVID-19 outbreak in India, USA, China, Japan, Italy, Iran, Canada and Germany.CONCLUSIONS: A long-term prediction of cumulative cases, spreadability rate, pandemic peak of COVID-19 was made for India.MATERIALS AND METHODS Here, we present a different approach, a Bayesian negative binomial multilevel model with mixed effects, for the projection of the COVID-19 pandemic and apply this model to the Turkish case."}
