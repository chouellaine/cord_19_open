The docking scores were compared with 3CL(pro)-referenced inhibitors (Lopinavir and Ritonavir).The simple chemical structure, unique mode of action, and potent antiviral activities in vitro, coupled with the favorable safety data from clinical trials, emphasize that baicalein provides a great opportunity for the development of critically needed anti-coronaviral drugs.", "title_summ": "Discovery of baicalin and baicalein as novel, natural product inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease in vitroInhibition of SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CL(pro) by means of \u03b1-ketoamide and pyridone-containing pharmaceuticals using in silico molecular dockingEssential Oils as Antiviral Agents, Potential of Essential Oils to Treat SARS-CoV-2 Infection: An In-Silico InvestigationPotential inhibitors of coronavirus 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL(pro)): an in silico screening of alkaloids and terpenoids from African medicinal plants", "title_abstract_phrases": "A molecular docking analysis was carried out using 171 essential oil components with SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-CoV-2 M(pro)), SARS-CoV-2 endoribonucleoase (SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15/NendoU), SARS-CoV-2 ADP-ribose-1\u2033-phosphatase (SARS-CoV-2 ADRP), SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (SARS-CoV-2 RdRp), the binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-CoV-2 rS), and human angiotensin\u2212converting enzyme (hACE2).Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CL(pro) by means of \u03b1-ketoamide and pyridone-containing pharmaceuticals using in silico molecular dockingThe coronavirus disease infections (COVID-19) caused by a new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have been emerging in the entire world.However, essential oil components may act synergistically, essential oils may potentiate other antiviral agents, or they may provide some relief of COVID-19 symptoms.Essential Oils as Antiviral Agents, Potential of Essential Oils to Treat SARS-CoV-2 Infection: An In-Silico InvestigationEssential oils have shown promise as antiviral agents against several pathogenic viruses.Baicalin and baicalein were identified as the first non-covalent, non-peptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and exhibited potent antiviral activities in a cell-based system."}
