{"cluster": 6, "subcluster": 0, "abstract_summ": " AUC instrument can spin samples at speeds up to 60,000 rpm, generating forces approaching 300,000 g . A second source of error is caused by the chromatic aberration resulting from imperfections in the UV-visible absorption optics . The technique leverages the self-similarity of atom probe mass spectra collected at different times to correct for electrostatic artifacts ."}
