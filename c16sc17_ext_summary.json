Clinical trials are underway to test the risks and benefits of ARBs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization.Since angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), ACE inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) increase ACE2 receptor expression, it has been tacitly believed that the use of these agents may facilitate viral disease, thus they should not be used in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease.Since the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) enzyme is the receptor that allows SARS COV2 entry into cells, the fear was that pre-existing treatment with ACEi or ARB might increase the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of COVID-19 infection.Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system, whose expression dominates on lung alveolar epithelial cells, is the human cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19.Finally, some studies support the hypothesis that elevated ACE2 membrane expression and tissue activity by administration of ARB and/or infusion of soluble ACE2 could confer protective properties against inflammatory tissue damage in COVID-19 infection.", "title_summ": "Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and COVID-19 infectionRenin-angiotensin system at the heart of COVID-19 pandemicThe Lung, the Heart, the Novel Coronavirus, and the Renin-Angiotensin System;Relationship between ACE-inhibitors, ARBs and SARS-CoV-2 infection: where are we?ACE2 and COVID-19 and the resulting ARDS.Angiotensin II Receptors - Impact for COVID-19 Severity.The Need for Clinical TrialsClinical Implications of SARS-Cov2 Interaction with Renin Angiotensin SystemPathological Role of Angiotensin II in Severe COVID-19", "title_abstract_phrases": "Drugs that prevent the inflammatory actions of Angiotensin II (i.e., Angiotensin receptor blockers, ARBs) prevent acute lung injury caused by SARS-CoV.
