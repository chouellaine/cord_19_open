{"cluster": 7, "subcluster": 37, "abstract_summ": " When a Petri net system of some class is synthesised from a labelled transition system, it may be interesting to derive structural properties of the corresponding reachability graphs and to use them in a pre-synthesis phase . This was exploited for the synthesis of choice-free nets for instance, for which several interesting properties have been derived ."}
