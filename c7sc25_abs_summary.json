{"cluster": 7, "subcluster": 25, "abstract_summ": " We introduce a novel automata model, which we call pebble-intervals automata, and study its power and closure properties . PIAs are tailored for a decidable fragment of FO that is important for reasoning about structures that use data values from infinite domains . The new system employs Lambek\u2019s non-emptiness restriction, which is incompatible with the standard (sub)exponential setting ."}
