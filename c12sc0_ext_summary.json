{"cluster": 12, "subcluster": 0, "abstract_summ": "We collected user connection data, network performance, and service availability for more than 2 years from the 120 squares and undertook experiments with video streaming in five squares.We used this unique large dataset to evaluate the impact of current admission control practices in public Wi-Fi networks on the network QoS, user QoE and service availability, also providing insights into the most common QoS/QoE issues and their causes.Fog computing brings benefits for enhancing the QoE for VoD services by caching the content closer to the user in a multi-tier fog architecture, considering their available resources to improve QoE. In this context, it is mandatory to consider network, fog node, and user metrics to choose an appropriate fog node to distribute videos with QoE support properly.Recent developments of data monitoring and analytics technologies in the context of wireless networks will boost the capacity to extract knowledge about the network and the users.We also leveraged the data set to establish and verify a correlation between the number of users access in the network and specific events occurring in the area.", "title_summ": "A Measurement Study on the ZeroNetImpact of Long-Range Dependent Traffic in IoT Local Wireless Networks on Backhaul Link PerformanceA network paradigm for very high capacity mobile and fixed telecommunications ecosystem sustainable evolutionA Multi-TierDecentralized and Adaptive K-Means Clustering for Non-IID Data Using HyperLogLog CountersCombined 5G-Based Video Production and Distribution in a Crowded Stadium EventOn the Prediction of Future User Connections Based on Historical Records in Wireless NetworksProfiling of a large-scale municipal wireless networkLook Deep into the New Deep Network:Fog Content Orchestrator Mechanism with Quality of Experience Support", "title_abstract_phrases": "We used this unique large dataset to evaluate the impact of current admission control practices in public Wi-Fi networks on the network QoS, user QoE and service availability, also providing insights into the most common QoS/QoE issues and their causes.We collected user connection data, network performance, and service availability for more than 2 years from the 120 squares and undertook experiments with video streaming in five squares.Fog computing brings benefits for enhancing the QoE for VoD services by caching the content closer to the user in a multi-tier fog architecture, considering their available resources to improve QoE.
