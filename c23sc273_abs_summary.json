{"cluster": 23, "subcluster": 273, "abstract_summ": " We study a statistical lattice model of a mitigated epidemic . The level of mitigation, defined by measures to slow down the spread of the infection, is characterized by the infection transmissivity . We compute time dependence of daily new infections as a function of infection, initial infection, and testing . We propose a simple theoretical approach for the expansion of contagious diseases ."}
