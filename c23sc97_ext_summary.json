{"cluster": 23, "subcluster": 97, "abstract_summ": "Objective: To estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and percent of infections diagnosed in New York State, overall and by region, age, sex, and race and ethnicity.While case counts in the entire region remain considerably less than those being reported by individual countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, SSA countries remain vulnerable to significant COVID morbidity and mortality due to systemic healthcare weaknesses, less financial resources and infrastructure to address the new crisis, and untreated comorbidities.Cumulative incidence was higher among Hispanic/Latino (29.2%, 95% CI: 27.2-31.2%), non-Hispanic black/African American (20.2% 95% CI, 18.1-22.3%), and non-Hispanic Asian (12.4%, 95% CI: 9.4-15.4%) adults than non-Hispanic white adults (8.1%, 95% CI: 7.4-8.7%, p<.0001).CONCLUSIONS: From the largest US serosurvey to date, we estimated > 2 million adult New York residents were infected through late March, with substantial disparities, although cumulative incidence remained below herd immunity thresholds.Conclusion: Countries with systemic, demographic, and pre-existing health vulnerabilities to severe COVID-related morbidity and mortality are less likely to report any cases or are reporting with limited public availability of information.", "title_summ": "Cumulative incidence and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in New YorkSeeding COVID-19 across sub-Saharan Africa: an analysis of reported importation events across 40 countriesCharacteristics of Doctors\u2019 Fatality due to COVID-19 in Western Europe and Asia-Pacific countriesCumulative incidence and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in New YorkIncreased Risk of COVID-19-Related Deaths among General Practitioners in Italy.", "title_abstract_phrases": "Objective: To estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and percent of infections diagnosed in New York State, overall and by region, age, sex, and race and ethnicity.While case counts in the entire region remain considerably less than those being reported by individual countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, SSA countries remain vulnerable to significant COVID morbidity and mortality due to systemic healthcare weaknesses, less financial resources and infrastructure to address the new crisis, and untreated comorbidities.Cumulative incidence and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in New YorkPURPOSE: New York State (NYS) is an epicenter of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the United States.Cumulative incidence and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in New YorkImportance: New York State (NYS) is an epicenter of the United States' COVID-19 epidemic.CONCLUSIONS: From the largest US serosurvey to date, we estimated > 2 million adult New York residents were infected through late March, with substantial disparities, although cumulative incidence remained below herd immunity thresholds."}
