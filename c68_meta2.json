This performance led to the launch of an enterprise-wide HAPI reduction initiative in our organization. The purpose of this article is to describe the improvement initiative, the key drivers, and the resulting decrease in the SPS-reportable HAPI rate. METHODS: We designed a hospital-wide HAPI reduction initiative with actions grouped into 3 key driver areas: standardization, data transparency, and accountability. We paused all individual hospital unit-based HAPI reduction initiatives. We calculated the rate of SPS-reportable HAPIs per 1,000 patient days during both the pre- and postimplementation phases and compared mean rates using a 2-sided t test assuming unequal variances. RESULTS: The mean SPS-reportable HAPI rate for the preimplementation phase was 0.3489, and the postimplementation phase was 0.0609. The difference in rates was statistically significant (P < 0.00032). This result equates to an 82.5% reduction in HAPI rate.

This report describes a novel approach to support patient safety. METHODS: An interdisciplinary children\u2019s hospital team developed a brief ED-based evaluation process called the ED Rapid Assessment of Patients Intended for Inpatient Disposition (ED RAPID). It entails a brief evaluation of vital signs and clinical stability by the ED attending physician and nurse. Children deemed stable are admitted to inpatient wards, whereas those requiring immediate intervention undergo full ED evaluation and disposition. We assessed outcomes for all children evaluated through this process from March 2013 through February 2015. RESULTS: During the study period, we identified 715 patients undergoing ED RAPID evaluation. Of these, we directly admitted 691 (96.4%) to the hospital ward after ED RAPID evaluation; median ED treatment time was 4.0 minutes. We transitioned 24 (3.4%) to full ED evaluation, 14 (2.0%) because a ward bed was unavailable, and 10 (1.4%) for clinical reasons identified in the evaluation. We admitted four of the 10 stopped (40% of stops, 0.6% of total) to an intensive care unit, and 6 (60% of stops, 0.8% of total) to the hospital ward after ED care. Eight children (1.1%) admitted to the hospital ward after ED RAPID evaluation required a transfer to an intensive care unit within 12 hours.

Discussion: Standard precautions in order to prepare a facility and its personnel to safely care for COVID-19 patients as outlined by the World Health Organization procedures have been implemented. Further actions undertaken in our Neonatal Unit included the creation of standard operating procedures, increased communication between neonatal and obstetric teams, limiting staff exposure, the creation of disposable resuscitation boxes to attend deliveries, reallocation of a triage area in the high care ward to an isolation area for sick newborns of suspected or confirmed maternal COVID-19 cases, staff training on personal protective equipment procedures and initiation of an online resources portal for neonatal staff. Conclusion: A rational approach to suspected cases and infection control in-line with local and international guidelines as well as ongoing education should diminish anxiety amongst health-care professionals and provide the best possible care to patients.

The high communicability of the COVID-19 necessitates robust medical preparedness and vigilance. OBJECTIVE: To report on the simulation-based training and test preparedness activities to prepare healthcare workers (HCWs) for effective and safe handling of patients with COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: Two activities were conducted: simulation-based training to all HCWs and a full-scale unannounced simulation-based disaster exercise at King Fahad Medical City (KFMC). The online module was designed to enhance the knowledge on COVID-19. This module was available to all KFMC staff. The five hands-on practical part of the course was available to frontliner HCWs. The unannounced undercover simulated patients\u2019 full-scale COVID-19 simulation-based disaster exercise took place in the emergency department over 3 hours. Six scenarios were executed to test the existing plan in providing care of suspected COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: 2620 HCWs took the online module, 17 courses were conducted and 337 frontliner HCWs were trained. 94% of learners were satisfied and recommended the activity to others. The overall compliance rate of the full-scale COVID-19 disaster drill with infection control guidelines was 90%. Post-drill debriefing sessions recommended reinforcing PPE training, ensuring availability of different sizes of PPEs and developing an algorithm to transfer patients to designated quarantine areas. CONCLUSION: Simulation-based training and preparedness testing activities are vital in identifying gaps to apply corrective actions immediately. In the presence of a highly hazardous contagious disease like COVID-19, such exercises are a necessity to any healthcare institution.","publish_time":1590537600000,"author_summary":" Lababidi, Hani M S; Alzoraigi, Usamah;<br>Almarshed, Abdullah Abdulaziz; AlHarbi, Waleed; AlAmar,<br>Mohamad; Arab, Amer A; Mukahal, Mahmoud A; AlAsmari,<br>Faisal A; Mzahim, Bandar Y; AlHarastani, Husam A M;<br>Alammi, Salem S; AlAwad, Yousef I","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic is presenting<br>serious challenges to the world\u2019s healthcare systems.<br>The high communicability of the COVID-19<br>necessitates robust medical preparedness and vigilance.<br>OBJECTIVE: To report on the simulation-based training and<br>test preparedness activities to prepare<br>healthcare workers (HCWs) for effective and safe handling<br>of patients with COVID-19.

Clinicians and medical representative bodies such as the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine (IAEM) have expressed concern that some patients may not seek timely urgent medical intervention. Evidence from previous epidemics found that hospital avoidance during outbreaks of MERS and SARS was common. While ED attendance returned to normal following SARS and MERS, both outbreaks lasted 2-3 months. As the COVID-19 pandemic is forecast to extend into 2021, little is known about the impact COVID-19 will have on paediatric attendance at EDs as the pandemic evolves. Aims: This project aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 on paediatric emergency healthcare utilisation, to understand how the health seeking behaviour of parents may have altered due to the pandemic, and to identify how any barriers to accessing care can be removed. Methods: Administrative data records from five EDs across Ireland and one Urgent Care Centre will be analysed to identify changes in attendances at emergency healthcare. Qualitative inquiry will be utilised to capture the experience of staff providing emergency healthcare to paediatric patients during COVID-19, and their feedback on identified trends will inform the interpretation of findings. A cross-sectional survey of parents will capture experiences, concerns and decision-making on accessing healthcare for their children during the pandemic. Results and Conclusion: This information will help decision makers respond rapidly to meet the clinical needs of paediatric patients as the circumstances of the pandemic unfold and reduce the disruption to normal paediatric ED services during the onset of COVID-19. As the health of a child can deteriorate more rapidly than that of an adult, any delay in seeking care for an acutely ill child may have serious consequences.","publish_time":1591660800000,"author_summary":" McDonnell, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se; McAuliffe, Eilish;<br>Barrett, Michael; Conlon, Ciara; Cummins, Fergal;<br>Deasy, Conor; Hensey, Conor; Martin, Ciara;<br>Nicholson, Emma","abstract_summary":" Background: Measures introduced to delay the<br>spread of COVID-19 may result in avoidance of<br>emergency departments (EDs) for non-COVID related<br>illness.

Numerous epidemiological models forecast regional or national peak bed and ventilator needs, but these are not suitable for predictions at the hospital level. We developed an analytical model to assist hospitals in determining their census and ventilator requirements for COVID-19 patients during future periods of the pandemic, by using their data. This model is based on (1) projection of future daily admissions using counts from the previous seven days, (2) lengths of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation, and (3) the percentage of inpatients requiring mechanical ventilation. The implementation is done within an Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) workbook without the use of add-ins or macro programming. The model inputs for each currently hospitalized patient with COVID-19 are the duration of hospitalization, whether the patient is currently receiving or has previously received mechanical ventilation, and the duration of the current ventilation episode, if applicable. Data validity and internal consistency are checked within the workbook, and errors are identified. Durations of care (length of hospital stay and duration of mechanical ventilation) are generated by fitting a two-parameter Weibull distribution to the hospital\u2019s historical data from the initial phase of the pandemic (incorporating censoring due to ongoing care), for which we provide source code in the R programming language (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Conditional distributions are then calculated using the hospital\u2019s current data. The output of the model is nearly instantaneous, producing an estimate of the census and the number of ventilators required in one, three, and seven days following the date on which the simulation is run. Given that the pandemic is ongoing, and a second surge of cases is expected with the reopening of the economy, having such a tool to predict resource needs for hospital planning purposes has been useful. A major benefit to individual hospitals from such modeling has been to provide reassurance to state and local governments that the hospitals have sufficient resources available to meet anticipated needs for new COVID-19 patients without having to set aside substantially greater numbers of beds or ventilators for such care. Such ongoing activity is important for the economic recovery of hospitals that have been hard-hit economically by the shutdown in elective surgery and other patient care activities.

At the same time, other problems (shortages, new and complex purchasing procedures, etc.) surfaced, so they could risk safety along the pharmacotherapeutic process. The main objective was to develop and implement all the necessary measures within the logistics circuit in order to ensure the availability of medicines for patients, as safely and effectively as possible, during the Coronavirus crisis. Firstly, two pharmacists were appointed to coordinate the whole process, and a preliminary analysis of the following aspects was carried out an estimation of needs to make an initial drug provisioning, a storage feasibility study and a global analysis of the logistics process to detect critical points. Three different circuits for medicines supply were established as some drugs were operated by Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios (AEMPS) or Servicio Madrile\u00f1o de Salud (SERMAS), and others were under no restrictions. For stocks control, inventory was frequently reviewed and monitoring of prescription trends was implemented. For all new medicinal products, compliance with security standards was reviewed and relabeling was carried out if necessary. Criteria were defined for the storage of overstocks and it was placed an isolated area for quarantined drugs. Shortages inevitably occurred but their effects were partly mitigated by AEMPS and SERMAS. After all, we consider that the implemented procedure for logistics management may be reproducible, and the key points we have identified are the following: to enhance our quality management system, to develop an Action Plan for Healthcare Emergencies and to ensure the adequate training for all pharmacy staff. Furthermore, we also should address other aspects: to establish storage optimization strategies, to focus on a more advanced logistics management model, as well as to take advantage of the extraordinary multidisciplinary network, which has been consolidated during this COVID pandemic.","publish_time":1591920000000,"author_summary":" Palomar-Fern\u00e1ndez, Carmen; \u00c1lvarez-D\u00edaz,<br>Ana","abstract_summary":" COVID crisis has abruptly broken into our<br>hospitals, and many difficulties have emerged, including<br>those related to supply logistics.

A quick three-days complete reorganization of the entire hospital was needed. A COVID-19 care team including a multidisciplinary panel of physicians, nurses, and RPTs was quickly performed to manage 90 beds for post acute patients with COVID-19. Within the team, the RPTs changed their shifts, so as to be available 16h per day, 7 days out of 7. Remodelled tasks in charge of RPTs were: oxygen therapy daily monitoring, non invasive ventilation (NIV) and continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) delivery, pronation and postural changes to improve oxygenation, reconditioning with leg\/arm cranking and exercises, initial and final patients' functional assessment by short-physical performance battery (SPPB) and 1-minute sit-to-stand test (1-STS) to evaluate motor conditions and exercise-induced oxygen desaturation. Three \"what-to-do\" algorithms were developed to guide: i) oxygen de-escalation by reducing inhaled fraction of oxygen (FiO2); ii) oxygenation improvement through the use of Venturi mask; iii) reconditioning and physical activity. One-hundred seventy patients were treated in one month. As main topics, RPTs have been involved in oxygen therapy management in almost a third of the admitted patients, reconditioning exercises in 60% of the cases, and initial and final functional motor capacity assessment in all patients. Details of activities performed by the RPT in one typical working day are also shown. Our reorganization has exploited the professional skills and clinical expertise of the RPTs. This re-organization can provide practical insights to other facilities that are facing this crisis, and may be a starting point for implementing post-COVID-19 rehabilitation. Future studies will have to improve and review this organization.","publish_time":1589846400000,"author_summary":" Simonelli, Carla; Paneroni, Mara; Fokom,<br>Aubin Georges; Saleri, Manuela; Speltoni, Ilaria;<br>Favero, Irene; Garofali, Francesca; Scalvini,<br>Simonetta; Vitacca, Michele","abstract_summary":" Due to COVID-19 outbreak, to lighten the burden<br>of acute and critical care hospitals, some<br>respiratory rehabilitation departments have been used to<br>host patients with COVID-19 in the post-acute<br>phase.

Measures have been adopted in on-site outpatient pharmacy clinics to prevent exposure of patients and professionals to the virus. These measures are based on national and international recommendations on social distancing and hygiene. With regard to remote outpatient pharmacy services, teleconsultation with drug dispensing has been promoted based on five basic procedures, each with its advantages and limitations: home drug delivery from HPSs, with the advantage of universal access and the limitation of entailing a substantial investment in resources; HPS coordination with primary care pharmacists, which requires no investments but with limited access to some geographic areas; HPS coordination with community pharmacists based on a large network of pharmacies, which requires the patient to go to the pharmacy, without confidentiality being guaranteed for any patient; geolocation and hospital-based medication dispensing, which provides universal access and direct traceability, but entails investment in human resources; and HPS coordination with associations of patients, which does not entail any additional cost but limits the information available on the diseases of society members. Three main lessons have been learned during the pandemic: the satisfactory capacity of HPS to provide outpatient pharmacy consultation services in the setting of a public health crisis; the usefulness of Telepharmacy for the clinical follow-up, healthcare coordination, outpatient counseling, and informed dispensing and delivery of medication (with a high level of satisfaction among patients); and the need to foster Telepharmacy as a complementary tool through a mixed model of outpatient pharmacy consultation service that incorporates the advantages of each procedure and adapts to the individual needs of each patient in a context of humanized healthcare.","publish_time":1592006400000,"author_summary":" Margusino-Frami\u00f1\u00e1n, Luis; Illarro-Uranga,<br>Aitziber; Lorenzo-Lorenzo, Karina; Monte-Boquet,<br>Emilio; M\u00e1rquez-Saavedra, Esther;<br>Fern\u00e1ndez-Bargiela, Noelia; G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez, David; Lago-Rivero,<br>Natividad; Poveda-Andr\u00e9s, Jos\u00e9 Luis; D\u00edaz-Acedo, Roc\u00edo;<br>Hurtado-Bouza, Juan Luis; S\u00e1nchez-Gund\u00edn, Julia;<br>Casanova-Mart\u00ednez, Cristina; Morillo-Verdugo, Ram\u00f3n","abstract_summary":" Hospital Pharmacy Service (HPS) in Spain have<br>been impacted by the health crisis caused by the<br>COVID-19 pandemic.

We describe the organizational process in setting up a coronavirus disease 2019 triage unit in a Swiss tertiary care hospital. METHODS Our triage unit was set-up outside of the main hospital building and consists of three areas: 1. Pre-triage, 2. Triage, and 3. Triage plus. The Pre-triage check-points identify any potential COVID-19-infected patients and re-direct them to the main Triage area where trained medical staff screen which patients undergo diagnostic testing. If testing is indicated, nasopharyngeal swabs are performed. If patients require further investigations, they are referred to Triage plus. At this stage, patients are then discharged home after additional testing or admitted to the hospital for management. OBSERVATIONS A total of 1,265 patients were screened between March 10th 2020 and April 12th 2020 at our Triage unit. Of these, 112 (8.9%) tested positive. 73 (65%) of the positively-tested patients were female and 39 (35%) were male. The mean age for all patients was 43.8 years (SD 16.3 years). Distinguishing between genders, mean age for females was 41.1 (SD 16.5) and mean age for males was 48.6 (SD 14.9), with females being significantly younger than males (p<0.001).

The human and material resources available in a mid-size hospital were more limited than in larger hospitals of the region. In this article, we describe how this Department of Hospital Pharmacy was reorganized to meet the increase in activity, the strategies developed and the lessons learned for future pandemics. The COVID-19 pandemic had a higher impact in Leganes, a city in the south of Madrid, with a population of 190,000. In the face of the dramatic increase in the proportion of patients attending our hospital between March and April 2020, the Severo Ochoa University Hospital increased the number of beds by 24.5% and fitted out new premises inside and outside the hospital (sports centers). The mean number of patients seen in our Emergency Department every day passed from 70-80 to a peak of 286 patients, with 652 hospitalized patients. The situation of emergency created by this infectious disease, with management protocols changing constantly, had a dramatic impact on the activity of hospital pharmacies. Thus, the pandemic has affected areas of economic management, magistral preparation, dispensing of medication to inpatients, ambulatory patients, patients monitored at home, institutionalized patients, and patients from private hospitals and field hospitals. Other areas affected include training, clinical trials, pharmacovigilance, and counseling boards. Two strategies were adopted to overcome these problems: a strategy centered on human resources (staff reinforcement, reallocation of responsibilities), and a strategy centered on processes (some processes were reinforced to meet the increase in activity, whereas other were temporarily suspended or reduced to the minimum).Conclusions: The Department of Hospital Pharmacy plays a key role in hospitals and has been significantly reinforced to meet the dramatic impact of the pandemic on this service. This Department has been able to reorganize its processes and take over new responsibilities such as telepharmacy and home dispensing. Hospital pharmacies play a crucial role in pharmacotherapeutic decisions in hospitals. As in other Departments, training is the area more significantly affected by the pandemic.","publish_time":1591920000000,"author_summary":" Corregidor-Luna, Laura; Hidalgo-Correas,<br>Francisco J; Garc\u00eda-D\u00edaz, Benito","abstract_summary":" The purpose of this article is to report the<br>experience of the Department of Hospital Pharmacy of a<br>mid-size hospital during the peak of the COVID-19<br>pandemic.

We aimed at evaluating its safety and efficiency. We reported on time to medical decision, time spent documenting electronic medical records (EMR), overall time of screening, and emergency center return evaluations.

In March 2020, we established a Covid-19 triage center close to the Li\u00e8ge University EDs. From March 2 to March 23, we planned to analyze the specific flow of patients admitted to this triage zone and their characteristics in terms of inner specificities, work-up and management. During this period, all patients presented to the ED with symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 were included in the study. RESULTS A total amount of 1071 patients presented to the triage center during the study period. 41.50% of the patients presented with flu-like symptoms.

METHOD Six weeks after the beginning of the confinement period, an online 10- question survey was sent to all members of the Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacists. A single response per hospital was requested. The survey included questions on the provision of remote pharmaceutical care prior to the onset of the health crisis, patient selection criteria, procedures for home delivery of medications and the means used to deliver them, the number of patients who benefited from telepharmacy, and the number of referrals made. Finally, respondents were asked whether a teleconsultation was carried out before sending patients their medication and whether these deliveries were recorded. RESULTS A total of 39.3% (n = 185) of all the hospitals in the National Health System (covering all of Spain's autonomous regions) responded to the survey. Before the beginning of the crisis, 83.2% (n = 154) of hospital pharmacy services did not carry out remote pharmaceutical care activities that included telepharmacy with remote delivery of medication. During the study period, 119,972 patients were treated, with 134,142 deliveries of medication being completed. Most hospitals did not use patient selection criteria. A total of 30.2% of hospitals selected patients based on their personal circumstances. Home delivery and informed delivery (87%; 116,129 deliveries) was the option used in most cases. The means used to deliver the medication mainly included the use of external courier services (47.0%; 87 hospitals) or the hospital's own transport services (38.4%; 71 hospitals). As many as 87.6% of hospitals carried out teleconsultations prior to sending out medications and 59.6% recorded their telepharmacy activities in the hospital pharmacy appointments record.

Interestingly, Emergency Department (ED) referrals for reasons other than Covid-19 seem to have declined steeply. In the present paper, we aimed to verify how the Covid-19 outbreak changed ED referral pattern. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of patients referred to the ED of a University Hospital in Northern Italy from 1st March to 13th April 2020. We compared the following data with those belonging to the same period in 2019: number of EDs accesses, rate of hospital admission, frequencies of the most common causes of ED referral, priority codes of access. RESULTS The number of ED referrals during the Covid-19 outbreak was markedly reduced when compared to the same period in 2019 (3059 vs. 5691;-46.3%). Conversely, the rate of hospital admission raised from 16.9% to 35.4% (p<0.0001), with a shift toward higher priority codes of ED admission. In 2020, we observed both a reduction of the number of patients referred for both traumatic (513, 16.8% vs. 1544, 27.1%; \u03c72=118.7, p<0.0001) and non-traumatic (4147 vs. 2546) conditions. Among the latter, suspected Covid-19 accounted for 1101 (43.2%) accesses. CONCLUSIONS The Covid-19 pandemic completely changed the pattern of ED referral in Italy, with a marked reduction of the accesses to the hospitals. This could be related to a limited exposure to traumas and to a common fear of being infected during EDs in-stay. This may limit the misuse of EDs for non- urgent conditions, but may also delay proper referrals for urgent conditions.","publish_time":1592265600000,"author_summary":" Bellan, Mattia; Gavelli, Francesco; Hayden,<br>Eyal; Patrucco, Filippo; Soddu, Daniele;<br>Pedrinelli, Anita R; Cittone, Micol G; Rizzi, Eleonora;<br>Casciaro, Giuseppe F; Vassia, Veronica; Landi,<br>Raffaella; Menegatti, Mirta; Gastaldello, Maria L;<br>Beltrame, Michela; Labella, Emanuela; Tonello,<br>Stelvio; Avanzi, Gian C; Pirisi, Mario; Castello, Luigi<br>M; Sainaghi, Pier P","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease<br>(COVID-19) outbreak is putting the European National<br>Health Systems under pressure.

Methods: We conducted an observational study, examining demographics and diagnoses for all patient visits to the ED of an urban Level-1 trauma center before and after the state declaration and compared them to visits from a similar period in 2019. We estimated the ratios of the before and after periods using Poisson regression, calculated the percent change with respect to 2019 for total ED visits, patient characteristics, and diagnoses, and then evaluated the interactions between each factor and the overall change in ED visits. Results: There was a significant 35.2% drop in overall ED visits after the state declaration. Disproportionate declines were seen in visits by pediatric and older patients, women, and Medicare recipients as well as for presentations of syncope, cerebrovascular accidents, urolithiasis, abdominal and back pain.

Conclusions: Patient concerns about health care settings and public health have significantly altered care-seeking during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Considerable attention has been paid to the burden COVID-19 has put on acute care hospitals, with numerous models projecting hospitalizations and ICU needs for the duration of the pandemic. However, less attention has been paid to where these patients may go if they require additional care following hospital discharge. As COVID-19 patients recover from severe infections, many of them require additional care. Yet with post-acute care facilities averaging 85% capacity prior to the pandemic and the significant potential for outbreaks, consideration of the downstream effects of the surge of hospitalized COVID-19 patients is critical. Here, we present a method for projecting COVID-19 post-acute care needs. Our model is designed to take the output from any of the numerous epidemiological models (hospital discharges) and estimate the flow of patients to post-acute care services, thus providing a similar surge planning model for post-acute care services. Using data from the University of Utah Hospital, we find that for those who require specialized post-acute care, the majority require either home health care or skilled nursing facilities. Likewise, we find the expected peak in post-acute care occurs about two weeks after the expected peak for acute care hospitalizations, a result of the duration of hospitalization. This short delay between acute care and post-acute care surges highlights the importance of considering the organization necessary to accommodate the influx of recovering COVID patients and protect non-COVID patients prior to the peak in acute care hospitalizations. We developed this model to guide policymakers in addressing the \"aftershocks\" of discharged patients requiring further supportive care; while we only show the outcomes for discharges based on preliminary data from the University of Utah Hospital, we suggest alternative uses for our model including adapting it to explore potential alternative strategies for addressing the surge in acute care facilities during future pandemic waves.","publish_time":1592006400000,"author_summary":" Maloney, M.; Morley, R.; Checketts, R.; Weir,<br>P.; Barfuss, D.; Meredith, H.

This study aimed to determine the number of critically ill patients with COVID-19 who required intensive care, including mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), during the pandemic and to compare these patient numbers with Japan's overall intensive care capacity. Methods: Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine datasets were used to obtain the number of confirmed patients with COVID-19 who had undergone mechanical ventilation and ECMO between February 15 and June 4 2020, to determine and compare intensive care unit (ICU) and attending bed needs for patients with COVID-19, and to estimate peak ICU demands in Japan. Results: In total, 17968 ICU days, 15171 mechanical ventilation days, and 2797 ECMO days were attributable to patients with COVID-19. There was a median (interquartile range) 143 (63-255) patients in ICU, 124 (51-225) patients on mechanical ventilation, and 18 (15-36) patients on ECMO machines. During the epidemic peak in late April, 11443 patients (1.03 per 10000 adults) had been infected, 373 patients (0.034 per 10000 adults) were in ICU, 312 patients (0.028 per 10000 adults) were receiving mechanical ventilation, and 62 patients (0.0056 per 10000 adults) were on ECMO machines per day. The number of infected patients at the peak of the epidemic was 651% of total designated beds and the number of patients requiring intensive care at the peak of the epidemic was 6.0% of total ICU beds in Japan, 19.1% of total board-certified intensivists in Japan and 106% of total designated medical institutions for Category II infectious diseases in Japan, respectively. Conclusions: Following the state of emergency declaration on April 7 2020, the number of patients with COVID-19 and the number of critically ill patients continued to rise, exceeding the number of designated beds but not exceeding ICU capacity.

Design A survey comprising a series of closed questions and a free text comments box allowing for a qualitative analysis. Setting Online survey. Participants British Thoracic Society members and multi-professional clinicians, across specialities were invited to take part. Results 1031 participants responded from a broad range of specialities over 6 days. There was overwhelming support for early post discharge from hospital phase of the recovery programme to advise patients about the management of fatigue (95% agreed\/ strongly agreed), breathlessness (94%), and mood disturbances (including symptoms of anxiety and depression) 92%. At the 6-8-week time point an assessment was considered important, focusing on the assessment of a broad range of possible symptoms and the need to potentially return to work. Recommendations for the intervention described a holistic programme focusing on symptom management, return of function and return to employment.

Methods: We developed a mechanistic transmission model to simulate a range of scenarios of COVID-19 spread in the Greater Toronto Area. We estimated healthcare needs against 2019 daily admissions using healthcare administrative data, and applied outputs to hospital-specific data on catchment, capacity, and baseline non-COVID admissions to estimate potential surge by day 90 at two hospitals (St. Michael\u0092s Hospital [SMH] and St. Joseph\u0092s Health Centre [SJHC]). We examined fast\/large, default, and slow\/small epidemics, wherein the default scenario (R0 2.4) resembled the early trajectory in the GTA. Results: Without further interventions, even a slow\/small epidemic exceeded the city\u0092s daily ICU capacity for patients without COVID-19. In a pessimistic default scenario, for SMH and SJHC to remain below their non-ICU bed capacity, they would need to reduce non-COVID inpatient care by 70% and 58% respectively. SMH would need to create 86 new ICU beds, while SJHC would need to reduce its ICU beds for non-COVID care by 72%. Uncertainty in local epidemiological features was more influential than uncertainty in clinical severity. If physical distancing reduces contacts by 20%, maximizing the diagnostic capacity or syndromic diagnoses at the community-level could avoid a surge at each hospital. Interpretation: As distribution of the city\u0092s surge varies across hospitals over time, efforts are needed to plan and redistribute ICU care to where demand is expected.

From the Plan-Do-Check-Act improvement cycle, they were grouped into categories: risk management, organizational management and decision-making. Finally, an external team carried out a qualitative evaluation of the implementation of the contingency plan carried out. RESULTS The Intestinal Inflammatory Disease Unit of the Digestive Service has obtained an assessment of compliance with the 10 recommended measures to confidently face a pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Sharing the deployment of the contingency plan and its results is useful to identify good practices. This article shows a method to evaluate decision-making in pandemic situations. The outcomes faces the The Intestinal Inflammatory Disease Unit in an excelent position.","publish_time":1592265600000,"author_summary":" Carpio L\u00f3pez, Daniel; Mart\u00ednez Pillado,<br>Modesto; Salgado Barreira, \u00c1ngel; Daponte Angueira,<br>Sandra; D\u00edez Lage, Raquel; Castro Ortiz, Elena;<br>Fern\u00e1ndez Salgado, Estela; P\u00e9rez Galindo, Pablo; Turnes<br>V\u00e1zquez, Juan","abstract_summary":" OBJECTIVE Decision making in hospitals, and<br>especially in their own healthcare services, is hardly<br>referenced in the literature.

Methods A cross-sectional point prevalence survey, was developed and disseminated through the pediatric emergency medicine research networks for Europe (REPEM) and the United Kingdom and Ireland (PERUKI). We aimed to include ten EDs for countries with > 20 million inhabitants and five EDs for less populated countries, unless the number of eligible EDs was below five. ED directors or their delegates completed the survey between March 20th and 21st to report practice at that time. We used descriptive statistics to analyse data. Results Overall 102 centers from 18 countries (86% response rate) completed the survey: 34% did not have an ED contingency plan for pandemics and 36% had never had simulations for such events. Wide variation on PPE items was shown for recommended PPE use at pre-triage and for patient assessment, with 62% of centers experiencing shortage in one or more PPE items, most frequently FFP2\/N95 masks. Only 17% of EDs had negative pressure isolation rooms. COVID-19 positive ED staff was reported in 25% of centers. Conclusion We found variation and identified gaps in preparedness and response to the COVID-19 epidemic across European referral EDs for children. A lack in early availability of a documented contingency plan, provision of simulation training, appropriate use of PPE, and appropriate isolation facilities emerged as gaps that should be optimized to improve preparedness and inform responses to future pandemics.","publish_time":1589500800000,"author_summary":" Bressan, Silvia; Buonsenso, Danilo;<br>Farrugia, Ruth; Parri, Niccolo\u2019; Oostenbrink, Rianne;<br>Titomanlio, Luigi; Roland, Damian; Nijman, Ruud G.;<br>Maconochie, Ian; Da Dalt, Liviana; Mintegi, Santiago","abstract_summary":" Abstract Study objective We aimed to describe<br>the variability and identify gaps in preparedness<br>and response to the COVID-19 pandemic in European<br>EDs caring for children.

METHODS: We described the intensive care unit (ICU) and inpatient bed needs for confirmed COVID-19 patients in two Chinese cities (Wuhan and Guangzhou) from January 10 to February 29, 2020, and compared the timing of disease control measures in relation to the timing of SARS-CoV-2 community spread. We estimated the peak ICU bed needs in US cities if a Wuhan-like outbreak occurs. RESULTS: In Wuhan, strict disease control measures were implemented six weeks after sustained local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Between January 10 and February 29, COVID-19 patients accounted for an average of 637 ICU patients and 3,454 serious inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 19,425 patients (24.5 per 10,000 adults) were hospitalized, 9,689 (12.2 per 10,000 adults) were considered to be in serious condition, and 2,087 patients (2.6 per 10,000 adults) needed critical care per day. In Guangzhou, strict disease control measures were implemented within one week of case importation. Between January 24 and February 29, COVID-19 accounted for an average of 9 ICU patients and 20 inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 15 patients were in critical condition, and 38 were classified as serious. If a Wuhan-like outbreak were to happen in a US city, the need for healthcare resources may be higher in cities with a higher prevalence of vulnerable populations. CONCLUSION: Even after the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, the number of seriously ill COVID-19 patients continued to rise, exceeding local hospitalization and ICU capacities for at least a month.

While the COVID infection is typically not a primary cerebrovascular condition, the downstream effects of this pandemic force adjustments to stroke care pathways to maintain optimal stroke patient outcomes. METHODS: The University of California San Diego (UCSD) Health System encompasses two academic, Comprehensive Stroke Centers (CSCs). The UCSD Stroke Center reviewed the national COVID-19 crisis and implications on stroke care. All current resources for stroke care were identified and adapted to include COVID-19 screening. The adjusted model focused on comprehensive and rapid acute stroke treatment, reduction of exposure to the healthcare team, and preservation of PPE. AIMS: The adjusted pathways implement telestroke assessments as a specific option for all inpatient and outpatient encounters and accounts for when telemedicine systems are not available or functional. COVID screening is done on all stroke patients. We outline a model of hyperacute stroke evaluation in an adapted stroke code protocol and novel methods of stroke patient management. CONCLUSIONS: The overall goal of the model is to preserve patient access and outcomes while decreasing potential COVID-19 exposure to patients and healthcare providers. This model also serves to reduce the use of vital PPE.

METHODS: Infection control recommendations, emergency department protocols and stroke response pathways utilized prior to the COVID 19 pandemic within our institution were evaluated by our stroke team in collaboration with the multidisciplinary healthcare services. Challenges during the COVID-19 scenario were identified, from which a revised acute stroke care algorithm was formulated to adapt to this pandemic. RESULTS: We formulated an algorithm that incorporates practices from internationally devised protocols while tailoring certain aspects to suit the available resources in our system locally. We highlighted the significance of the following: team role designation, coordination among different subspecialties and departments, proper use of personal protective equipment and resources, and telemedicine use during this pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This pandemic has shaped the stroke team's approach in the management of acute stroke patients. Our algorithm ensures proper resource management while optimizing acute stroke care during the COVID-19 pandemic in our local setting.

Emergency departments (ED) in hospitals are on the frontlines, serving an essential function in identifying these patients, isolating them early whilst providing urgent medical care. This outbreak has reinforced the role of Emergency Medicine in public health. This paper documents the challenges faced and measures taken by a tertiary hospital\u2019s ED in Singapore, in response to the outbreak. MAIN BODY: The ED detected the first case of COVID-19 in Singapore on 22 January 2020 in a Chinese tourist and also the first case of locally transmitted COVID-19 on 3 February 2020. The patient journeys through the patient reception area in the ED and undergoes fever screening before being shunted to isolation areas within the ED. Management and disposition of suspect COVID-19 patients are guided by a close-knit collaboration between ED and department of infectious diseases. With increasing number of patients, back-up plans for expansion of space and staff augmentation have been enacted. Staff safety is also of utmost importance, with provision and guidelines for personal protective equipment and team segregation to ensure no cross-contamination across staff. These have been made possible with an early setup of an operational command and control structure within the ED, managing manpower, logistics, operations, communication and information management and liaison with other clinical departments. CONCLUSION: With the large numbers of undifferentiated patients managed by the ED to date, more than 820 patients with COVID-19 have been identified in the hospital. Not a single member of the staff of the SGH Emergency Department has come down with the illness. The various measures undertaken by the department have helped to ensure good staff morale and strict adherence to safety procedures. We share the lessons learnt so that others who manage EDs around the world can benefit from our experience.","publish_time":1592352000000,"author_summary":" Quah, Li Juan Joy; Tan, Boon Kiat Kenneth; Fua,<br>Tzay-Ping; Wee, Choon Peng Jeremy; Lim, Chin Siah;<br>Nadarajan, Gayathri; Zakaria, Nur Diana; Chan, Shi-En<br>Joanna; Wan, Paul Weng; Teo, Lin Tess; Chua, Ying Ying;<br>Wong, Evelyn; Venkataraman, Anantharaman","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 disease outbreak<br>that first surfaced in Wuhan, China, in December<br>2019, has taken the world by storm and ravaged almost<br>every country in the world.

Government-initiated measures to decrease healthcare utilization (i.e., \u201cflattening the curve\u201d) have included shelter-in-place mandates and social distancing, which have taken effect across most of the USA. We evaluate the immediate impact of the Public Health Messaging and shelter-in-place mandates on Emergency Department (ED) demand for radiology services. METHODS: We analyzed ED radiology volumes from the five University of California health systems during a 2-week time period following the shelter-in-place mandate and compared those volumes with March 2019 and early April 2019 volumes. RESULTS: ED radiology volumes declined from the 2019 baseline by 32 to 40% (p < 0.001) across the five health systems with a total decrease in volumes across all 5 systems by 35% (p < 0.001). Stratifying by subspecialty, the smallest declines were seen in non-trauma thoracic imaging, which decreased 18% (p value < 0.001), while all other non-trauma studies decreased by 48% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Total ED radiology demand may be a marker for public adherence to shelter-in-place mandates, though ED chest radiology demand may increase with an increase in COVID-19 cases.

Global health care now faces unprecedented challenges with widespread and rapid human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and high morbidity and mortality with COVID-19 worldwide. Across the world, medical care is hampered by a critical shortage of not only hand sanitizers, personal protective equipment, ventilators, and hospital beds, but also impediments to the blood supply. Blood donation centers in many areas around the globe have mostly closed. Donors, practicing social distancing, some either with illness or undergoing self-quarantine, are quickly diminishing. Drastic public health initiatives have focused on containment and \u201cflattening the curve\u201d while invaluable resources are being depleted. In some countries, the point has been reached at which the demand for such resources, including donor blood, outstrips the supply. Questions as to the safety of blood persist. Although it does not appear very likely that the virus can be transmitted through allogeneic blood transfusion, this still remains to be fully determined.

METHOD: Tiantan hospital is one of the leading neuroscience institutions in the world. With 1650 beds, its annual inpatient admission exceeds 30 000 patients. Its COVID-19 rapid response policy was reviewed for its functionality. RESULTS: There are nine key components of this policy: an incident management system; a comprehensive infection prevention and control, outpatient triage and flow system; a designated fever clinic; patient screening and administration; optimised surgical operations, enhanced nucleic acid testing; screening of returning employees; and a supervision and feedback system. In addition, a specific protocol was designed for treating patients with acute stroke.

The emergency department and anesthesiology department of Galway University Hospital conducted a series of multidisciplinary, in situ simulations to rapidly identify operational errors and latent safety hazards in response to this outbreak. Each simulation involved an interdisciplinary response to a suspected\/COVID-19 patient. The cases were used as a training opportunity for staff and ultimately a platform to expeditiously implement system changes in response to deficits identified during the simulations.

Furthermore, rapid and effective stroke care remains paramount to achieve maximal functional recovery for those needing admission and to triage care appropriately for those who may be presenting with neurological symptoms but have an alternative diagnosis. METHODS\u2014: Available resources, COVID-19-specific infection prevention and control recommendations, and expert consensus were used to identify clinical screening criteria for patients and provide the required nuanced considerations for the healthcare team, thereby modifying the conventional code stroke processes to achieve a protected designation. RESULTS\u2014: A protected code stroke algorithm was developed. Features specific to prenotification and clinical status of the patient were used to define precode screening. These include primary infectious symptoms, clinical, and examination features. A focused framework was then developed with regard to a protected code stroke.

Since February 2020, multiple, consecutive ED closures have occurred due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis in Daegu. However, sudden ED closures are in contravention of laws for the provision of emergency medical care that enable the public to avail prompt, appropriate, and 24-hour emergency medical care. Therefore, this study ascertained the vulnerability of the ED at tertiary hospitals in Daegu with regard to the current standards. A revised triage and surveillance protocol has been proposed to tackle the current crisis. METHODS: This study was retrospectively conducted at 6 level 1 or 2 EDs in a metropolitan city where ED closure due to COVID-19 occurred from February 18 to March 26, 2020. The present status of ED closure and patient characteristics and findings from chest radiography and laboratory investigations were assessed. Based on the experience from repeated ED closures and the modified systems that are currently used in EDs, revised triage and surveillance protocols have been developed and proposed. RESULTS: During the study period, 6 level 1 or 2 emergency rooms included in the study were shut down 27 times for 769 hours. Thirty-one confirmed COVID-19 cases, of whom 7 died, were associated with the incidence of ED closure. Typical patient presentation with respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 was seen in less than 50% of patients, whereas abnormal findings on chest imaging investigations were detected in 93.5% of the study population. The chest radiography facility, resuscitation rooms, and triage area were moved to locations outside the ED, and a new surveillance protocol was applied to determine the factors warranting quarantine, including symptoms, chest radiographic findings, and exposure to a source of infection. The incidence of ED closures decreased after the implementation of the revised triage and surveillance protocols. CONCLUSION: Triage screening by emergency physicians and surveillance protocols with an externally located chest imaging facility were effective in the early isolation of COVID-19 patients. In future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, efforts should be focused toward the provision of continued ED treatment with the implementation of revised triage and surveillance protocols.","publish_time":1589241600000,"author_summary":" Chung, Han Sol; Lee, Dong Eun; Kim, Jong Kun;<br>Yeo, In Hwan; Kim, Changho; Park, Jungbae; Seo, Kang<br>Suk; Park, Sin-Yul; Kim, Jung Ho; Kim, Gyunmoo; Lee,<br>Suk Hee; Cheon, Jeon Jae; Kim, Yang Hun","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: When an emergency-care patient is<br>diagnosed with an emerging infectious disease,<br>hospitals in Korea may temporarily close their emergency<br>departments (EDs) to prevent nosocomial transmission.<br>Since February 2020, multiple, consecutive ED<br>closures have occurred due to the coronavirus disease<br>2019 (COVID-19) crisis in Daegu.

Many of them have acquired SARS-CoV-2 and some have died. In Africa, where the pandemic is escalating, there are major gaps in response capacity, especially in human resources and protective equipment. We examine these challenges and propose interventions to protect healthcare workers on the continent, drawing on articles identified on Medline (Pubmed) in a search on 24 March 2020. Global jostling means that supplies of personal protective equipment are limited in Africa. Even low-cost interventions such as facemasks for patients with a cough and water supplies for handwashing may be challenging, as is \u2018physical distancing\u2019 in overcrowded primary health care clinics. Without adequate protection, COVID-19 mortality may be high among healthcare workers and their family in Africa given limited critical care beds and difficulties in transporting ill healthcare workers from rural to urban care centres. Much can be done to protect healthcare workers, however. The continent has learnt invaluable lessons from Ebola and HIV control. HIV counselors and community healthcare workers are key resources, and could promote social distancing and related interventions, dispel myths, support healthcare workers, perform symptom screening and trace contacts. Staff motivation and retention may be enhanced through carefully managed risk \u2018allowances\u2019 or compensation. International support with personnel and protective equipment, especially from China, could turn the pandemic\u2019s trajectory in Africa around. Telemedicine holds promise as it rationalises human resources and reduces patient contact and thus infection risks. Importantly, healthcare workers, using their authoritative voice, can promote effective COVID-19 policies and prioritization of their safety. Prioritizing healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 testing, hospital beds and targeted research, as well as ensuring that public figures and the population acknowledge the commitment of healthcare workers may help to maintain morale. Clearly there are multiple ways that international support and national commitment could help safeguard healthcare workers in Africa, essential for limiting the pandemic\u2019s potentially devastating heath, socio-economic and security impacts on the continent.","publish_time":1589500800000,"author_summary":" Chersich, Matthew F.; Gray, Glenda; Fairlie,<br>Lee; Eichbaum, Quentin; Mayhew, Susannah;<br>Allwood, Brian; English, Rene; Scorgie, Fiona;<br>Luchters, Stanley; Simpson, Greg; Haghighi, Marjan<br>Mosalman; Pham, Minh Duc; Rees, Helen","abstract_summary":" Medical staff caring for COVID-19 patients<br>face mental stress, physical exhaustion,<br>separation from families, stigma, and the pain of losing<br>patients and colleagues.

Late May, 2020, over 100,000 COVID-19 related deaths were reported in the United State, the highest number of any country. This article describes COVID-19 as the next historical turning point in the physical therapy profession\u2019s growth and development. The profession has had over a 100-year tradition of responding to epidemics including poliomyelitis; two world wars and geographical regions experiencing conflicts and natural disasters; and the epidemic of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The evidence-based role of non-invasive interventions (non-pharmacologic\/non-surgical) that hallmark physical therapist practice has emerged as being highly relevant today in addressing COVID-19 in two primary ways. First, despite some unique features, COVID-19 presents as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in its severe acute stage. ARDS is well familiar to physical therapists in intensive care units. Body positioning and mobilization, prescribed based on comprehensive assessments\/examinations, counter the negative sequelae of recumbency and bedrest; augment gas exchange and reduce airway closure, deconditioning and critical illness complications; and maximize long-term functional outcomes. Physical therapists have an indisputable role across the COVID-19 care continuum. Second, over 90% of individuals who contract and die from COVID-19 have co-morbidities, most notably cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic lung disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Physical therapists need to redouble their efforts to address NCDs by assessing patients for risk factors and manifestations and institute evidence-based health education (smoking cessation, whole-food plant-based nutrition, weight control, physical activity\/exercise), and\/or support patients\u2019 efforts when these are managed by other professionals. Effective health education is a core competency for addressing risk of COVID-19 as well as NCDs. COVID-19 is a wake-up call to the profession, an opportunity to assert its role throughout the COVID-19 care continuum and augment public health initiatives by reducing the impact of the current pandemic.","publish_time":1593129600000,"author_summary":" Dean, Elizabeth; Jones, Alice; Yu, Homer<br>Peng-Ming; Gosselink, Rik; Skinner, Margot","abstract_summary":" Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has<br>sounded alarm bells throughout global health systems.<br>Late May, 2020, over 100,000 COVID-19 related<br>deaths were reported in the United State, the highest<br>number of any country.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative effectiveness study analyzed the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Guangzhou, China, from January 10 to February 29, 2020. EXPOSURES: Timing of disease control measures relative to timing of SARS-CoV-2 community spread. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Number of critical and severe patient\u2013days and peak number of patients with critical and severe illness during the study period. RESULTS: In Wuhan, strict disease control measures were implemented 6 weeks after sustained local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Between January 10 and February 29, 2020, patients with COVID-19 accounted for a median (interquartile range) of 429 (25-1143) patients in the ICU and 1521 (111-7202) inpatients with serious illness each day. During the epidemic peak, 19 425 patients (24.5 per 10 000 adults) were hospitalized, 9689 (12.2 per 10 000 adults) were considered in serious condition, and 2087 (2.6 per 10 000 adults) needed critical care per day. In Guangzhou, strict disease control measures were implemented within 1 week of case importation. Between January 24 and February 29, COVID-19 accounted for a median (interquartile range) of 9 (7-12) patients in the ICU and 17 (15-26) inpatients with serious illness each day. During the epidemic peak, 15 patients were in critical condition and 38 were classified as having serious illness. The projected number of prevalent critically ill patients at the peak of a Wuhan-like outbreak in US cities was estimated to range from 2.2 to 4.4 per 10 000 adults, depending on differences in age distribution and comorbidity (ie, hypertension) prevalence. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Even after the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, the number of patients with serious COVID-19 illness continued to rise, exceeding local hospitalization and ICU capacities for at least a month.

Methods We conducted a survey with sections addressing hospital characteristics, changes in infrastructure and resources, code stroke clinical pathways, diagnostic testing, rehabilitation, and outpatient care. We performed a descriptive analysis of results according to the level of complexity of stroke care (availability of stroke units and mechanical thrombectomy). Results The survey was completed by 22 of the 26 hospitals in the Madrid Regional Health System that attend adult emergencies, between 16 and 27 April 2020. Ninety-five percent of hospitals had reallocated neurologists to care for patients with COVID-19. The numbers of neurology ward beds were reduced in 89.4% of hospitals; emergency department stroke care pathways were modified in 81%, with specific pathways for suspected SARS-CoV2 infection established in 50% of hospitals; and SARS-CoV2-positive patients with acute stroke were not admitted to neurology wards in 42%. Twenty four hour on-site availability of mechanical thrombectomy was improved in 10 hospitals, which resulted in a reduction in the number of secondary hospital transfers. The admission of patients with transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke was avoided in 45% of hospitals, and follow-up through telephone consultations was implemented in 100%.

Initial analysis suggests that 5% of infected patients will require critical care, and that respiratory failure requiring intubation is associated with high mortality. Sick patients are geographically dispersed: most patients will remain in situ until they are in need of critical care. Additionally, there are likely to be patients who require retrieval for other reasons but who are co-incidentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 or shedding virus. The COVID-19 pandemic therefore poses a challenge to critical care retrieval systems, which often depend on small teams of specialists who live and work together closely. The infection or quarantining of a small absolute number of these staff could catastrophically compromise service delivery. Avoiding occupational exposure to COVID-19, and thereby ensuring service continuity, is the primary objective of aeromedical retrieval services during the pandemic. In this discussion paper we collaborated with helicopter emergency medical services(HEMS) worldwide to identify risks in retrieving COVID-19 patients, and develop strategies to mitigate these. Simulation involving the whole aeromedical retrieval team ensures that safety concerns can be addressed during the development of a standard operating procedure. Some services tested personal protective equipment and protocols in the aeromedical environment with simulation. We also incorporated experiences, standard operating procedures and approaches across several HEMS services internationally. As a result of this collaboration, we outline an approach to the safe aeromedical retrieval of a COVID-19 patient, and describe how this framework can be used to develop a local standard operating procedure.","publish_time":1590364800000,"author_summary":" Bredmose, Per P.; Diczbalis, Monica;<br>Butterfield, Emma; Habig, Karel; Pearce, Andrew; Osbakk,<br>Svein Are; Voipio, Ville; Rudolph, Marcus; Maddock,<br>Alistair; O\u2019Neill, John","abstract_summary":" The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 emerged in<br>December 2019 and is now pandemic.

Little is known about the impact of COVID19 on pharmacy services across the United Kingdom (UK). We surveyed community pharmacists across the UK to understand their protective practices, professional and general well-being, and the delivery of pharmacy services during the COVID19 pandemic. METHODS: Community pharmacists were invited to participate in a cross-sectional survey via the nationwide weekly newsletter of Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee and the local pharmaceutical committees during the second week of May 2020. The survey remained open for 4 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 206 pharmacists responded to the survey with representations from England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. The majority of pharmacists (>75% or above) reported an increase in customer traffic to their pharmacy and were asking relevant questions from patients with flu-like symptoms before signposting them to the appropriate care. Most pharmacists (>85%) were maintaining a safe distance of 2 m from customers and 72% were wearing an N95 protective mask and 28% were using protective gloves and apron in addition to safe distancing and protective masks. Ninety-nine percent of pharmacists reported drug shortages with 38% and 26% reported significant drug shortages and critical drug shortages causing disruptions beyond over the counter medicines. Eighty-nine percent pharmacists reported inappropriate behaviour from patients or carers with 31% and 16% reported it to be a regular or frequent problem, respectively. Fifty-three% of pharmacists were willing to offer their assistance for mass testing of COVID19 antibodies if adequate training and reimbursement are provided. CONCLUSION: Community pharmacists in the UK are facing considerable challenges in terms of personal protection and the delivery of pharmacy services. Inappropriate behaviour from patients and carers towards community pharmacists require urgent attention to ensure a safe working place for all community pharmacists.","publish_time":1594252800000,"author_summary":" Razi Zaidi, Syed Tabish; Hasan, Syed Shahzad","abstract_summary":" INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease (COVID19)<br>has adversely affected the delivery of various<br>health services.

The response of the Emergency Medicine network, integrating \u201cout-of-hospital\u201d and \u201chospital\u201d activation, is crucial whenever the health system has to face a medical emergency, being caused by natural or human-derived disasters as well as by a rapidly spreading epidemic outbreak. We here report the Pavia Emergency Medicine network response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The \u201cout-of-hospital\u201d response was analysed in terms of calls, rescues and missions, whereas the \u201chospital\u201d response was detailed as number of admitted patients and subsequent hospitalisation or discharge. The data in the first 5 weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak (February 21\u2013March 26, 2020) were compared with a reference time window referring to the previous 5 weeks (January 17\u2013February 20, 2020) and with the corresponding historical average data from the previous 5 years (February 21\u2013March 26). Since February 21, 2020, a sudden and sustained increase in the calls to the AREU 112 system was noted (+ 440%). After 5 weeks, the number of calls and missions was still higher as compared to both the reference pre-Covid-19 period (+ 48% and + 10%, respectively) and the historical control (+ 53% and + 22%, respectively). Owing to the overflow from the neighbouring hospitals, which rapidly became overwhelmed and had to temporarily close patient access, the population served by the Pavia system more than doubled (from 547.251 to 1.135.977 inhabitants, + 108%). To minimize the possibility of intra-hospital spreading of the infection, a separate \u201cEmergency Department\u2014Infective Disease\u201d was created, which evaluated 1241 patients with suspected infection (38% of total ED admissions). Out of these 1241 patients, 58.0% (n = 720) were admitted in general wards (n = 629) or intensive care unit (n = 91). To allow this massive number of admissions, the hospital reshaped many general ward Units, which became Covid-19 Units (up to 270 beds) and increased the intensive care unit beds from 32 to 60. In the setting of a long-standing continuing emergency like the present Covid-19 outbreak, the integration, interaction and team work of the \u201cout-of-hospital\u201d and \u201cin-hospital\u201d systems have a pivotal role. The present study reports how the rapid and coordinated reorganization of both might help in facing such a disaster. AREU-112 and the Emergency Department should be ready to finely tune their usual cooperation to respond to a sudden and overwhelming increase in the healthcare needs brought about by a pandemia like the current one.

Previous studies related to the SARS pandemic showed a decrease up to 80% in the emergency care episodes. Hence, the objective of this study is to analyze the use of emergency services during the first pandemic month, compared to historical records. METHODS: Data from emergency episodes in mainland Portugal, from January 2014 to March 2020, were downloaded from the National Health Service (NHS) Transparency Portal and the NHS monitoring website. The evolution of emergency services from March to September 2020 was forecasted based on historical data from January 2014 to February 2020. Information for March 2020 was forecasted globally, by the Regional Health Administration (RHA) and Manchester Triage System (MTS). RESULTS: Compared with forecasted values, there was a 48% reduction in the number of emergency episodes in March 2020. In the analysis by the RHA, Alentejo had the smallest decrease in the number of episodes; interestingly, Alentejo is also the area with fewer COVID-19 cases in mainland Portugal. In the analysis by the MTS, the episodes classified as yellow showed the highest reduction (50%). For episodes classified as urgent, there is a difference of about 144,000 episodes during March 2020. DISCUSSION: The results of this preliminary study are aligned with the evidence produced for previous pandemics. Data about the use of emergency services, demographic and clinical characteristics of the episodes would be relevant to analyze this reduction. CONCLUSION: There was a significant drop in the number of emergency service use in March 2020, and although the causes of this reduction are not determined, the association between the beginning of the pandemic and the reduction of demand is evident. Understanding this phenomenon is crucial to plan interventions to avoid unnecessary morbidities or deaths, caused by a delayed visit to the emergency department.","publish_time":1587081600000,"author_summary":" Santana, Rui; Sousa, Joana Santos; Soares,<br>Patr\u00edcia; Lopes, S\u00edlvia; Boto, Paulo; Rocha, Jo\u00e3o Victor","abstract_summary":" INTRODUCTION: Since December 2019, more than<br>925,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported<br>worldwide, 8,251 cases in Portugal by the end of March.<br>Previous studies related to the SARS pandemic showed a<br>decrease up to 80% in the emergency care episodes.

Spain, where headache is the main reason for outpatient neurology consultation, is one of the countries with the most reported cases of the disease. Objectives This study aimed to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on headache units in Spain and to evaluate how neurologists see the future of these units. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of headache units during the sixth week of the state of alarm declared in Spain in response to the pandemic. Results The response rate was 74%, with the participation of centres with different characteristics and from all Autonomous Communities of Spain. Limitations in face-to-face activity were reported by 95.8% of centres, with preferential face-to-face consultation being maintained in 60.4%, and urgent procedures in 45.8%. In 91.7% of centres, the cancelled face-to-face activity was replaced by telephone consultation. 95.8% of respondents stated that they would use personal protection equipment in the future, and 86% intended to increase the use of telemedicine. The majority foresaw an increase in waiting lists (93.8% for initial consultations, 89.6% for follow-up, and 89.4% for procedures) and a worse clinical situation for patients, but only 15% believed that their healthcare structures would be negatively affected in the future.

DESIGN: Analysis of Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) registry data, supplemented by an ICU surge capability survey and veterinary facilities survey (both March 2020). SETTINGS: All Australian ICUs and veterinary facilities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline numbers of ICU beds, ventilators, dialysis machines, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines, intravenous infusion pumps, and staff (senior medical staff, registered nurses); incremental capability to increase capacity (surge) by increasing ICU bed numbers; ventilator\u2010to\u2010bed ratios; number of ventilators in veterinary facilities. RESULTS: The 191 ICUs in Australia provide 2378 intensive care beds during baseline activity (9.3 ICU beds per 100 000 population). Of the 175 ICUs that responded to the surge survey (with 2228 intensive care beds), a maximal surge would add an additional 4258 intensive care beds (191% increase) and 2631 invasive ventilators (120% increase). This surge would require additional staffing of as many as 4092 senior doctors (245% increase over baseline) and 42 720 registered ICU nurses (269% increase over baseline). An additional 188 ventilators are available in veterinary facilities, including 179 human model ventilators. CONCLUSIONS: The directors of Australian ICUs report that intensive care bed capacity could be near tripled in response to the expected increase in demand caused by COVID\u201019.
