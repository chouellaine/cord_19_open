New vaccine candidates are therefore urgently needed. Highly conserved Plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte-binding protein homologue-5 (PfRH5) has been identified as a potential candidate for anti-disease vaccine development. PfRH5 is essential for erythrocyte invasion by merozoites and crucial for parasite survival. However, there is paucity of data on the extent of genetic variations on PfRH5 in field isolates of Plasmodium falciparum. This study described genetic polymorphisms at the high affinity binding polypeptides (HABPs) 36718, 36727, 36728 of PfRH5 in Nigerian isolates of P. falciparum. This study tested the hypothesis that only specific conserved B and T cell epitopes on PfRH5 HABPs are crucial for vaccine development. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-five microscopically confirmed P. falciparum samples collected in a prospective cross-sectional study of three different populations in Lagos, Nigeria. Genetic diversity and haplotype construct of Pfrh5 gene were determined using bi-directional sequencing approach. Tajima\u2019s D and the ratio of nonsynonymous vs synonymous mutations were utilized to estimate the extent of balancing and directional selection in the pfrh5 gene. RESULTS: Sequence analysis revealed three haplotypes of PfRH5 with negative Tajima\u2019s D and dN\/dS value of \u2212 1.717 and 0.011 \u00b1 0.020, respectively. A single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP (G \u2192 A) at position 608 was observed, which resulted in a change of the amino acid cysteine at position 203 to tyrosine. Haplotype and nucleotide diversities were 0.318 \u00b1 0.016 and 0.0046 \u00b1 0.0001 while inter-population genetic differentiation ranged from 0.007 to 0.037. Five polypeptide variants were identified, the most frequent being KTKYH with a frequency of 51.3%. One B-cell epitope, 151 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II T-cell epitopes, four intrinsically unstructured regions (IURs) and six MHC class I T-cell epitopes were observed in the study. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences showed clustering and evidence of evolutionary relationship with 3D7, PAS-2 and FCB-2 RH5 sequences. CONCLUSIONS: This study has revealed low level of genetic polymorphisms in PfRH5 antigen with B- and T-cell epitopes in intrinsically unstructured regions along the PfRH5 gene in Lagos, Nigeria. A broader investigation is however required in other parts of the country to support the possible inclusion of PfRH5 in a cross-protective multi-component vaccine.","publish_time":1578268800000,"author_summary":" Ajibaye, Olusola; Osuntoki, Akinniyi A.;<br>Balogun, Emmanuel O.; Olukosi, Yetunde A.; Iwalokun,<br>Bamidele A.; Oyebola, Kolapo M.; Hikosaka, Kenji;<br>Watanabe, Yoh-ichi; Ebiloma, Godwin U.; Kita, Kiyoshi;<br>Amambua-Ngwa, Alfred","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: Vaccines are the most reliable<br>alternative to elicit sterile immunity against malaria but<br>their development has been hindered by<br>polymorphisms and strain-specificity in previously studied<br>antigens.

Initial CHMI studies showed significantly higher durable protection against homologous than heterologous strains, suggesting the presence of strain-specific vaccine-induced protection. However, interpretation of these results and understanding of their relevance to vaccine efficacy have been hampered by the lack of knowledge on genetic differences between vaccine and CHMI strains, and how these strains are related to parasites in malaria endemic regions. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing using long-read (Pacific Biosciences) and short-read (Illumina) sequencing platforms was conducted to generate de novo genome assemblies for the vaccine strain, NF54, and for strains used in heterologous CHMI (7G8 from Brazil, NF166.C8 from Guinea, and NF135.C10 from Cambodia). The assemblies were used to characterize sequences in each strain relative to the reference 3D7 (a clone of NF54) genome. Strains were compared to each other and to a collection of clinical isolates (sequenced as part of this study or from public repositories) from South America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia. RESULTS: While few variants were detected between 3D7 and NF54, we identified tens of thousands of variants between NF54 and the three heterologous strains. These variants include SNPs, indels, and small structural variants that fall in regulatory and immunologically important regions, including transcription factors (such as PfAP2-L and PfAP2-G) and pre-erythrocytic antigens that may be key for sporozoite vaccine-induced protection. Additionally, these variants directly contributed to diversity in immunologically important regions of the genomes as detected through in silico CD8(+) T cell epitope predictions. Of all heterologous strains, NF135.C10 had the highest number of unique predicted epitope sequences when compared to NF54. Comparison to global clinical isolates revealed that these four strains are representative of their geographic origin despite long-term culture adaptation; of note, NF135.C10 is from an admixed population, and not part of recently formed subpopulations resistant to artemisinin-based therapies present in the Greater Mekong Sub-region.

For more than 125 years, the therapy against diphtheria has been based on polyclonal horse sera directed against DT (diphtheria antitoxin; DAT). Animal sera have many disadvantages including serum sickness, batch-to-batch variation in quality and the use of animals for production. In this work, 400 human recombinant antibodies were generated against DT from two different phage display panning strategies using a human immune library. A panning in microtiter plates resulted in 22 unique in vitro neutralizing antibodies and a panning in solution combined with a functional neutralization screening resulted in 268 in vitro neutralizing antibodies. 61 unique antibodies were further characterized as scFv-Fc with 35 produced as fully human IgG1. The best in vitro neutralizing antibody showed an estimated relative potency of 454 IU\/mg and minimal effective dose 50% (MED50%) of 3.0 pM at a constant amount of DT (4x minimal cytopathic dose) in the IgG format. The targeted domains of the 35 antibodies were analyzed by immunoblot and by epitope mapping using phage display. All three DT domains (enzymatic domain, translocation domain and receptor binding domain) are targets for neutralizing antibodies. When toxin neutralization assays were performed at higher toxin dose levels, the neutralizing capacity of individual antibodies was markedly reduced but this was largely compensated for by using two or more antibodies in combination, resulting in a potency of 79.4 IU\/mg in the in vivo intradermal challenge assay.

One of the main reasons of disease survival is diversity of vectors and parasites in different malaria regions that have their specific features, behaviour and biology. Therefore, specific regional strategies are necessary for successful control of malaria. One of the tools that needs to be developed for elimination and prevention of reintroduction of malaria is a vaccine that interrupt malaria transmission (VIMTs). VIMT is a broad concept that should be adjusted to the biological characteristics of the disease in each region. One type of VIMT is a vector-based vaccine that affects the sexual stage of Plasmodium life cycle. According to recent studies, the aminopeptidase N-1 of Anopheles gambiae (AgAPN-1) is as a potent vector-based VIMT with considerable inhibition activity against the sexual stage of Plasmodium parasite. METHODS: Systems for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3\u02b9-RACE) and genome walking methods were used for sequence determination of apn-1 gene from Anopheles stephensi and distinct bioinformatics software were used for structural analysis. AsAPN-1 was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cell line using the baculovirus expression system. Recombinant AsAPN-1 was purified under the hybrid condition and its biological activity was assayed. RESULTS: Asapn-1 gene and its coded protein from An. stephensi were characterized for the first time in this study. Subsequently, the structural features and immunological properties of its coded protein were evaluated by in silico approaches. Enzymatic activity of the recombinant AsAPN-1, which was expressed in Sf9 insect cell line, was equal to 6 unit\/\u03bcl. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study revealed that AsAPN-1 is very similar to its counterpart in An. gambiae. In silico evaluation and fundamental data which are necessary for its evaluation as a VIMT-based vaccine in the next steps were acquired in this study and those could be useful for research groups that study on malaria vaccine for countries that An. stephensi is the main malaria vector there.","publish_time":1582070400000,"author_summary":" Dadgar Pakdel, Javad; Zakeri, Sedigheh; Raz,<br>Abbasali; Dinparast Djadid, Navid","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: According to the World Health<br>Organization reports, billions of people around the world<br>are at risk for malaria disease and it is important<br>to consider the preventive strategies for<br>protecting the people that are living in high risk areas.<br>One of the main reasons of disease survival is<br>diversity of vectors and parasites in different malaria<br>regions that have their specific features, behaviour<br>and biology.

METHODS: The cross-sectional study was carried out in Bouak\u00e9 (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) where entomological data and blood samples from children (0\u201314 years) were collected in two sites with similar malaria prevalence. Antibody (IgG, IgG1, IgG3) responses to PfAMA1 and PfMSP1 were evaluated by ELISA. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to assess the relationship between the immune responses to P. falciparum antigens and exposure to Anopheles bites in the total cohort and in each site, separately. The individual level of exposure to Anopheles bites was evaluated by quantifying specific IgG response to the Anopheles gSG6-P1 salivary peptide, which represents a proxy of Anopheles exposure. RESULTS: The anti-Plasmodium humoral responses were different according to the level of exposure of children, with those highly exposed to Anopheles presenting significantly lower antibody responses to PfMSP1 in total population (IgG and IgG3) and in Petessou village (IgG, IgG1, IgG3). No significant difference was seen for PfAMA1 antigen between children differently exposed to Anopheles. In Dar-es-Salam, a neighbourhood where a high Culex density was reported, children presented very low antibody levels specific to both antigens, and no difference according to the exposure to Anopheles bites was found. CONCLUSION: These findings may suggest that immunomodulatory components of Anopheles saliva, in addition to other factors, may participate to the modulation of the humoral response specific to Plasmodium merozoite stage antigens.

Typhi) is a highly invasive bacterium that infects the human intestinal mucosa and causes ~ 11.9\u201320.6 million infections and ~ 130,000\u2013223,000 deaths annually worldwide. Oral typhoid vaccine Ty21a confers a moderate level of long-lived protection (5\u20137 years) in the field. New and improved vaccines against enteric pathogens are needed but their development is hindered by a lack of the immunological correlates of protection especially at the site of infection. Tissue resident memory T (T(RM)) cells provide immediate adaptive effector immune responsiveness at the infection site. However, the mechanism(s) by which S. Typhi induces T(RM) in the intestinal mucosa are unknown. Here, we focus on the induction of S. Typhi-specific CD4+T(RM) subsets by Ty21a in the human terminal ileum lamina propria and epithelial compartments. METHODS: Terminal ileum biopsies were obtained from consenting volunteers undergoing routine colonoscopy who were either immunized orally with 4 doses of Ty21a or not. Isolated lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) and intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) CD4+T(RM) immune responses were determined using either S. Typhi-infected or non-infected autologous EBV-B cell lines as stimulator cells. T-CMI was assessed by the production of 4 cytokines [interferon (IFN)\u03b3, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-17A and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1] in 36 volunteers (18 vaccinees and 18 controls volunteers). RESULTS: Although the frequencies of LPMC CD103+ CD4+T(RM) were significant decreased, both CD103+ and CD103\u2212 CD4+T(RM) subsets spontaneously produced significantly higher levels of cytokines (IFN\u03b3 and IL-17A) following Ty21a-immunization. Importantly, we observed significant increases in S. Typhi-specific LPMC CD103+ CD4+T(RM) (IFN\u03b3 and IL-17A) and CD103\u2212 CD4+T(RM) (IL-2 and IL-17A) responses following Ty21a-immunization. Further, differences in S. Typhi-specific responses between these two CD4+T(RM) subsets were observed following multifunctional analysis. In addition, we determined the effect of Ty21a-immunization on IEL and observed significant changes in the frequencies of IEL CD103+ (decrease) and CD103\u2212 CD4+T(RM) (increase) following immunization. Finally, we observed that IEL CD103\u2212 CD4+T(RM), but not CD103+ CD4+T(RM), produced increased cytokines (IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 and IL-17A) to S.

The CIDR\u03b11 domain of PfEMP1 is responsible for binding host endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), and increasing evidence support that this interaction triggers severe malaria, accounting for the majority of malaria-related deaths. In high transmission regions, children develop immunity to severe malaria after the first few infections. This immunity is believed to be mediated by antibodies targeting and inhibiting PfEMP1, causing infected erythrocytes to circulate and be cleared in the spleen. The development of immunity to malaria coincides with acquisition of broad antibody reactivity across the CIDR\u03b11 protein family. Altogether, this identifies CIDR\u03b11 as an important vaccine target. However, the antigenic diversity of the CIDR\u03b11 domain family is a challenge for vaccine development. METHODS: Immune responses in mice vaccinated with Virus-Like Particles (VLP) presenting CIDR\u03b11 antigens were investigated. Antibody reactivity was tested to a panel of recombinant CIDR\u03b11 domains, and the antibodies ability to inhibit EPCR binding by the recombinant CIDR\u03b11 domains was tested in Luminex-based multiplex assays. RESULTS: VLP-presented CIDR\u03b11.4 antigens induced a rapid and strong IgG response capable of inhibiting EPCR-binding of multiple CIDR\u03b11 domains mainly within the group A CIDR\u03b11.4\u20137 subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The study observations mirror those from previous CIDR\u03b11 vaccine studies using other vaccine constructs and platforms. This suggests that broad CIDR\u03b11 antibody reactivity may be achieved through vaccination with a limited number of CIDR\u03b11 variants.

Plasmodium merozoite surface protein 4 (MSP4) has been listed as a blood-stage subunit vaccine candidate for malaria. Infection with Plasmodium ovale species including P. ovale wallikeri and P. ovale curtisi, is also a source of malaria burden in tropical regions where it is sometimes mixed with other Plasmodium species. However, little is known about P. ovale MSP4. METHODS: The msp4 gene was amplified through polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA extracted from blood samples of 46 patients infected with P. ovale spp. and amplified products were sequenced. Open reading frames predicted as immunogenic peptides consisting of 119 and 97 amino acids of P. ovale curtisi MSP4 (PocMSP4) and P. ovale wallikeri MSP4 (PowMSP4), respectively, were selected for protein expression. Recombinant proteins (rPoMSP4) were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, analysed, and immunized in BALB\/c mice. The specificity of anti-MSP4-immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies was evaluated by Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and cellular immune responses were analysed via lymphocyte proliferation assays. RESULTS: Full peptide sequences of PocMSP4 and PowMSP4 were completely conserved in all clinical isolates, except in the epidermal growth factor-like domain at the carboxyl terminus where only one mutation was observed in one P. o. wallikeri isolate. Further, truncated PoMSP4 segments were successfully expressed and purified as ~ 32 kDa proteins. Importantly, high antibody responses with end-point titres ranging from 1:10,000 to 1:2,560,000 in all immunized mouse groups were observed, with high IgG avidity to PocMSP4 (80.5%) and PowMSP4 (92.3%). Furthermore, rPocMSP4 and rPowMSP4 cross-reacted with anti-PowMSP4-specific or anti-PocMSP4-specific antibodies. Additionally, anti-PoMSP4 IgG antibodies showed broad immuno-specificity in reacting against rPoMSP1 and rPoAMA1. Lastly, PocMSP4- and PowMSP4-immunized mice induced cellular immune responses with PocMSP4 (36%) and PowMSP4 cells (15.8%) during splenocyte proliferation assays. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study suggest conservation in PoMSP4 protein sequences and high immunogenicity was observed in rPoMSP4. Furthermore, induction of immune responses in PocMSP4- and PowMSP4-immunized mice informed that both humoral and cellular immune responses play crucial roles for PoMSP4 in protection.","publish_time":1585526400000,"author_summary":" Uwase, Juliette; Chu, Ruilin; Kassegne,<br>Kokouvi; Lei, Yao; Shen, Feihu; Fu, Haitian; Sun, Yifan;<br>Xuan, Yinghua; Cao, Jun; Cheng, Yang","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need for an<br>effective vaccine to control and eradicate malaria, one<br>of the most serious global infectious diseases.<br>Plasmodium merozoite surface protein 4 (MSP4) has been<br>listed as a blood-stage subunit vaccine candidate for<br>malaria.

An important task in antibody and vaccine preparation is to choose an optimal carrier that will ensure a high immune response. Particularly promising in this regard are nanoscale particle carriers. An antigen that is adsorbed or encapsulated by nanoparticles can be used as an adjuvant to optimize the immune response during vaccination. a very popular antigen carrier used for immunization and vaccination is gold nanoparticles, with are being used to make new vaccines against viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections. Areas covered: This review summarizes what is currently known about the use of gold nanoparticles as an antigen carrier and adjuvant to prepare antibodies in vivo and design vaccines against viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections.

Thus, alternated attenuation method was sought to reduce the reactogenicity of strain rSC0011. Herein, we described another recombinant attenuated S.

When delivering the same pS-SaoA plasmid, the intraperitoneal LD(50) of rSC0012 was 18.2 times higher than that of rSC0011 in 3-week-old BALB\/C mice. rSC0012 with either pS-SaoA or pYA3493 was cleared from spleen and liver tissues 7 days earlier than rSC0011 with same vectors after oral inoculation. The strain rSC0012 synthesizing SaoA induced high titers of anti-SaoA antibodies in both systemic (IgG in serum) and mucosal (IgA in vaginal washes) sites, as well as increased level of IL-4, the facilitator of Th2-type T cell immune response in mice. The recombinant vaccine rSC0012(pS-SaoA) conferred high percentage of protection against S. suis or S. Choleraesuis challenge in BALB\/C mice.

Besides culling measures in infected farms in endemic areas, vaccination is the major tool against HPAIV. However, the mainly used inactivated preparations have several limitations, like application to the individual animal by injection and a reduced efficiency.

Understanding the genetic diversity of pfmsp-3 is important for recognizing genetic nature and evolutionary aspect of the gene in the natural P. falciparum population and for designing an effective vaccine based on the antigen. METHODS: Blood samples collected from P. falciparum-infected patients in Naung Cho and Pyin Oo Lwin, Myanmar, in 2015 were used in this study. The pfmsp-3 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and sequenced. Genetic polymorphism and natural selection of Myanmar pfmsp-3 were analysed using the programs DNASTAR, MEGA6, and DnaSP 5.10.00. Genetic diversity and natural selection of the global pfmsp-3 were also comparatively analysed. RESULTS: Myanmar pfmsp-3 displayed 2 different alleles, 3D7 and K1. The 3D7 allelic type was predominant in the population, but genetic polymorphism was less diverse than for the K1 allelic type. Polymorphic characters in both allelic types were caused by amino acid substitutions, insertions, and deletions. Amino acid substitutions were mainly occurred at the alanine heptad repeat domains, whereas most insertions and deletions were found at the glutamate rich domain. Overall patterns of amino acid polymorphisms detected in Myanmar pfmsp-3 were similar in the global pfmsp-3 population, but novel amino acid changes were observed in Myanmar pfmsp-3 with low frequencies. Complicated patterns of natural selection and recombination events were predicted in the global pfmsp-3, which may act as major driving forces to maintain and generate genetic diversity of the global pfmsp-3 population. CONCLUSION: Global pfmsp-3 revealed genetic polymorphisms, suggesting that the functional and structural consequences of the polymorphisms should be considered in designing a vaccine based on PfMSP-3.

In this study, the ability of two recombinant IBV vaccine candidates, BeauR-M41(S) and BeauR-4\/91(S), to induce cross-protection against a third serotype, QX, was assessed. Both rIBVs are genetically based on the Beaudette genome with only the S gene derived from either M41 or 4\/91, two unrelated serotypes.

The impact of the order of vaccination was also assessed. Homologous primary and secondary vaccination with BeauR-M41(S) or BeauR-4\/91(S) resulted in a significant reduction of infectious QX load in the trachea at four days post-challenge, whereas heterologous primary and secondary vaccination with BeauR-M41(S) and BeauR-4\/91(S) reduced viral RNA load in the conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue (CALT). Both homologous and heterologous vaccination regimes reduced clinical signs and birds recovered more rapidly as compared with an unvaccinated\/challenge control group.

In a first experiment, vaccinated chickens were challenged with an IBV Ark99-type virulent strain (AL\/4614\/98). Despite extensive sequence similarity between the vaccines, the more heterogeneous commercial ArkDPI was more efficient at reducing viral loads in challenged chickens, while respiratory signs and tracheal lesions were reduced similarly by either vaccine. A distinct subpopulation of the Ark challenge virus showing asparagine at S1 position 56 was consistently negatively selected by immune pressure originating from vaccination with either vaccine. Antibody levels and antibody avidity to Ark-type S1 protein were greater in CEK-ArkDPI-vaccinated chickens compared to chickens vaccinated with the more diverse commercial ArkDPI vaccine. Synchronous replication of a homogeneous virus population likely elicits clonal expansion and affinity maturation of a greater number of responding B cells compared to a diverse virus population continuously changing its proportion of phenotypes during replication. The results of a second experiment showed that during initial vaccine virus replication (24 and 48 hr postvaccination), the virus population showing increased diversity (commercial ArkDPI) achieved higher concentrations of IBV RNA in the trachea compared to the more homogenous virus. mRNA expression of genes associated with innate immune responses in the trachea 48 hr postvaccination generally showed greater upregulation in chickens vaccinated with the heterogeneous commercial ArkDPI vaccine compared to the CEK-adapted virus. The greater upregulation of these genes is likely associated with higher virus replication achieved by the heterogeneous commercial vaccine. Thus, while the adaptive antibody response was favored by the more homogenous structure of the CEK-ArkDPI vaccine population (higher antibody levels and antibody avidity), the innate immune response was favored by the more diverse viral population of the commercial ArkDPI.

Here, we developed a thermostable therapeutic antibody against EBOV based on chicken immunoglobulin Y (IgY). The IgY antibodies demonstrated excellent thermal stability, which retained their neutralizing activity at 25\u00b0C for one year, in contrast to conventional polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). We immunized laying hens with a variety of EBOV vaccine candidates and confirmed that VSV \u0394 G\/EBOVGP encoding the EBOV glycoprotein could induce high titer neutralizing antibodies against EBOV. The therapeutic efficacy of immune IgY antibodies in vivo was evaluated in the newborn Balb\/c mice model.

Author Summary Although several Ebola virus therapeutic antibodies have been reported in recent years, however, due to the poor thermal stability of mammalian antibody, their application in tropical endemic areas has been limited. We developed a highly thermostable therapeutic antibody against EBOV based on chicken immunoglobulin Y (IgY). The IgY antibodies demonstrated excellent thermal stability, which retained their neutralizing activity at 25\u00b0C for one year. The newborn mice receiving passive transfer of IgY achieved complete protection against a lethal dose of virus challenge indicating that the anti-EBOV IgY provides a promising countermeasure to solve the current clinical application problems of Ebola antibody-based treatments in Africa.","publish_time":1590019200000,"author_summary":" Zhang, Yuan; Wei, Yanqiu; Li, Yunlong; Wang,<br>Xuan; Liu, Yang; Tian, Deyu; Jia, Xiaojuan; Gong,<br>Rui; Liu, Wenjun; Yang, Limin","abstract_summary":" Ebola virus (EBOV) is the most virulent<br>pathogens that cause hemorrhagic fever with high<br>mortality rates in humans and nonhuman primates.

Such benefits include local induction of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) as well as activation and maturation of mucosal dendritic cells, homing of effector cells to the mucosal surfaces, expression of specific host defense peptides, and other innate effector molecules. In addition, mucosal vaccination offers the opportunity to induce colostral and lactogenic immunity during pregnancy and the possibility of avoiding neutralization of early life vaccines by maternal antibodies, both of which are critical for protecting the most susceptible from infectious diseases. Moreover, mucosal administration offers the advantage of inducing both effective systemic immunity and mucosal immunity, enhancing vaccine efficacy and providing improved protection. A number of animal vaccines are already administered via the mucosal surfaces, with many more to come over the next few years. It is gratifying to see that veterinary vaccine development has yet again taken a leadership role in exploring innovative approaches and technologies to mucosal vaccination. For the veterinary field, considerations for mucosal vaccine development and use necessarily include costs (often pennies per dose), mass delivery that preferably avoids animal restraint, and economic and trade considerations.

Humoral immunity and cell\u2010mediated immunity were assessed by enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and ELISPOT in gE subunit vaccine and by ELISA and fluorescent antibody to membrane antigen in LAV. RESULTS: The gE subunit vaccine\u2010induced gE\u2010specific antibodies and CD4(+) T\u2010cell responses (indicated by interferon\u2010\u03b3 [IFN\u2010\u03b3] and interleukin\u20102 secretion) in the ssRNA\u2010based adjuvant containing the VZV gE gene. Therefore, an ssRNA adjuvant combined with gE antigen can trigger the innate immune response and induce an adaptive immune response to ultimately activate humoral and cell\u2010mediated responses. VZV LAV could also induce VZV\u2010specific antibodies and IFN\u2010\u03b3 stimulated by LAV, whereas the effect of ssRNA as a vaccine adjuvant could not be confirmed. However, the ssRNA adjuvant increased VZV\u2010specific neutralizing antibody response. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results highlight that the gE subunit vaccine and LAV developed in this study can be functional VZV vaccines, and ssRNAs appear to function better as adjuvants in a subunit vaccine than in an LAV.","publish_time":1584057600000,"author_summary":" Lee, Su Jeen; Park, Hyo\u2010Jung; Ko, Hae Li; Lee,<br>Jung Eun; Lee, Hyun Joo; Kim, Hun; Nam, Jae\u2010Hwan","abstract_summary":" INTRODUCTION: Varicella\u2010zoster virus (VZV),<br>a human alphaherpesvirus 3, elicits both<br>chickenpox and shingles and\/or postherpetic neuralgia.

Non-replicating Ad vectors possess several attributes which make them attractive vaccines for infectious disease, including their capacity for high titer growth, ease of manipulation, safety, and immunogenicity in clinical studies, as well as their compatibility with clinical manufacturing and thermo-stabilization procedures. In general, Ad vectors are immunogenic vaccines, which elicit robust transgene antigen-specific cellular (namely CD8(+) T cells) and\/or humoral immune responses. A large number of adenoviruses isolated from humans and non-human primates, which have low seroprevalence in humans, have been vectorized and tested as vaccines in animal models and humans. However, a distinct hierarchy of immunological potency has been identified between diverse Ad vectors, which unfortunately limits the potential use of many vectors which have otherwise desirable manufacturing characteristics. The precise mechanistic factors which underlie the profound disparities in immunogenicity are not clearly defined and are the subject of ongoing, detailed investigation. It has been suggested that a combination of factors contribute to the potent immunogenicity of particular Ad vectors, including the magnitude and duration of vaccine antigen expression following immunization. Furthermore, the excessive induction of Type I interferons by some Ad vectors has been suggested to impair transgene expression levels, dampening subsequent immune responses. Therefore, the induction of balanced, but not excessive stimulation of innate signaling is optimal. Entry factor binding or receptor usage of distinct Ad vectors can also affect their in vivo tropism following administration by different routes. The abundance and accessibility of innate immune cells and\/or antigen-presenting cells at the site of injection contributes to early innate immune responses to Ad vaccination, affecting the outcome of the adaptive immune response. Although a significant amount of information exists regarding the tropism determinants of the common human adenovirus type-5 vector, very little is known about the receptor usage and tropism of rare species or non-human Ad vectors. Increased understanding of how different facets of the host response to Ad vectors contribute to their immunological potency will be essential for the development of optimized and customized Ad vaccine platforms for specific diseases.","publish_time":1589846400000,"author_summary":" Coughlan, Lynda","abstract_summary":" Adenoviral vectors are a safe and potently<br>immunogenic vaccine delivery platform.

In the last decades, the use of nanoparticles as a delivery system in vaccines has received special attention to improve vaccine efficacy. These nanoparticles could be composed of lipids, metal and nonmetal inorganics, several polymers, and virus-like particles, which have been tested in research; some of them have already been approved for human and animal use. The characteristics of the nanoparticles have allowed targeting desired antigen-presenting cells to improve immunization strategies to induce protection. The main characteristics of the nanoparticles are to protect the antigens from early proteolytic degradation, control antigen release, and help antigen uptake and processing by antigen-presenting cells, and they should be safe for human and veterinary use. In addition, the nanoparticles could be modified in their physicochemical properties to target specific cells and improve vaccine efficacy. This chapter focuses on the nanoparticle-based vaccine formulations and the approaches used to realize efficient delivery of vaccines in order to induce host protective immunity against infectious diseases.","publish_time":1579219200000,"author_summary":" Diaz-Ar\u00e9valo, Diana; Zeng, Mingtao","abstract_summary":" Infectious diseases are the tip of the iceberg<br>in the economic burden of the developing<br>countries, due to the resistance of the pathogens to<br>antibiotics and the lack of vaccines.

The urgent need to decrease the use of antibiotics and increase animal welfare in beef production has forced us to introduce new preventive methods. Vaccinations could contribute to the solution, but the high incidence of BRD already at an early age has made it difficult to introduce suitable vaccination programs. Challenge studies have shown promising results in 3\u201314 day old calves vaccinated with intranasal BRD vaccine, but very few field trials are available to assess the efficacy of the intranasal vaccines in field conditions. We evaluated the effect of one dose of commercial intranasal vaccination on calf mortality, daily gain, and treatment incidence for BRD in one calf rearing unit. In total, 497 calves (mean age 19 days) were included in our study, 247 of which were vaccinated at the time of arrival to the unit and 250 served as negative controls (unvaccinated). Vaccinated and unvaccinated calves were situated in separate compartments until weaning. Daily gain, treatment incidence, and mortality were recorded until the calves were transported to the finishing unit, which averaged 154.5 days from arrival. RESULTS: Average daily gain over the complete study period was 1151.9 g\/day (SD 137.9) for the vaccinated calves and 1139.5 g\/day (SD 135.9) for the unvaccinated calves. Intranasal vaccination combined with older arrival age (17 days or older) resulted in a higher daily gain (47.8 g\/day) compared with unvaccinated calves (coef. 0.0478, p = 0.003). This association was not recorded in calves that were younger than 17 days upon arrival. Intranasal vaccination was not significantly associated either with mortality (OR 0.976, p = 0.968) or treatment incidence for BRD (OR 1.341, p = 0.120). In total, six vaccinated calves (2.43%) and six unvaccinated calves (2.40%) died during the study period.

The current study assessed the formation of influenza-specific and RSV-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses in the lungs of mice, with special attention to the lung tissue-resident memory T cell subsets (T(RM)). The RSV epitopes did not affect influenza-specific CD4 effector memory T cell (Tem) levels in the lungs. The majority of these cells formed by LAIV or LAIV-RSV viruses had CD69(+)CD103(-) phenotype. Both LAIV+NA\/RSV and LAIV+NS\/RSV recombinant viruses induced significant levels of RSV M2(82) epitope-specific lung-localized CD8 Tem cells expressing both CD69 and CD103 T(RM) markers. Surprisingly, the CD69(+)CD103(+) influenza-specific CD8 Tem responses were augmented by the addition of RSV epitopes, possibly as a result of the local microenvironment formed by the RSV-specific memory T cells differentiating to T(RM) in the lungs of mice immunized with LAIV-RSV chimeric viruses.

METHODS: To accurately identify the important immunodominant region of S1, the purified truncated S1 proteins (SA, SB, SC, SD and SE) were used to immunize BALB\/c mice to prepare polyclonal antibodies. The antisera titers were determined by indirect ELISA, western blot and IFA after four immunizations to find the important immunodominant region of S1, and then purified the immunodominant region of S1 protein and immunized mice to generate the special antibodies, and then used recombinant peptides to determine the B-cell epitopes of monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: Five antisera of recombinant proteins of the spike protein region of PEDV were generated and we found that only the polyclonal antibody against part of the S1 region (signed as SE protein, residues 666\u2013789) could recognize the native PEDV. Purified SE protein was used to immunize BALB\/c mice and generate mAb 2E10. Pepscan of the SE protein demonstrated that SE16 ((722)SSTFNSTREL(731)) is the minimal linear epitope required for reactivity with the mAb 2E10. Further investigation indicated that the epitope SE16 was localized on the surface of PEDV S protein in the 3D structure. CONCLUSIONS: A mAb 2E10 that is specifically bound to PEDV was generated and identified a specific linear B-cell epitope (SE16, (722)SSTFNSTREL(731)) of the mAb. The epitope region of PEDV S1 localized in the different regions in comparison with the earlier identified epitopes. These findings enhance the understanding of the PEDV spike protein structure for vaccine design and provide a potential use for developing diagnostic methods to detect PEDV.","publish_time":1585872000000,"author_summary":" Kong, Ning; Meng, Qiong; Jiao, Yajuan; Wu,<br>Yongguang; Zuo, Yewen; Wang, Hua; Sun, Dage; Dong, Sujie;<br>Zhai, Huanjie; Tong, Wu; Zheng, Hao; Yu, Hai; Tong,<br>Guangzhi; Xu, Yongjie; Shan, Tongling","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus<br>(PEDV) infection causes an acute enteric tract<br>infectious disease characterized by vomiting, anorexia,<br>dehydration, weight loss and high mortality in neonatal<br>piglets.

For oral vaccination, the vaccine delivery system should be able to stably carry antigens and adjuvants and resist harsh physicochemical conditions in the stomach and intestinal tract. Besides many nano\/microcarrier tools generated by using natural and chemical materials, the development of oral vaccine delivery systems using food materials should be more robustly researched to expand vaccine coverage of gastrointestinal infections in developing countries. For intranasal vaccination, the vaccine delivery system should survive the very active mucociliary clearance mechanisms and prove safety because of the anatomical location of nasal cavity separated by a thin barrier.

Thus, development of novel adjuvant that offers safe and effective immunity is of urgent need. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present research engineers a novel chicken adjuvant with potent immune-potentiating capability by incorporating avian toll\ufeff-like receptor 21 (TLR21) agonist CpG ODN 2007 with a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based hollow nanoparticle platform (CpG-NP), which subsequently assessed ex vivo and in vivo. RESULTS: CpG-NPs with an average diameter of 164 nm capable of sustained release of CpG for up to 96 hours were successfully prepared. With the ex vivo model of chicken bone marrow\ufeff-derived dendritic cells (chBMDCs), CpG-NP was engulfed effectively and found to induce DC maturation, promoting dendrite formation and upregulation of CD40, CD80 and CCR7. In addition to enhanced expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3, 53\/84 immune\ufeff-related genes were found to be stimulated in CpG-NP-treated chBMDCs, whereas only 39 of such genes were stimulated in free CpG-treated cells. These upregulated genes suggest immune skewing toward T helper cell 1 bias and evidence of improved mucosal immunity upon vaccination with the CpG-NP. The CpG-NP-treated chBMDCs showed protective effects to DF-1 cells against avian influenza virus H6N1 infection. Upon subsequent coupling with infectious bronchitis virus subunit antigen administration, chickens were immunostimulated to acquire higher humoral immune response and protective response against viral challenge. CONCLUSTION: This work presents a novel hollow CpG-NP formulation, demonstrating effective and long-lasting immunostimulatory ability ex vivo and in vivo for chickens, as systemically compared to free CpG. This enhanced immune stimulation benefits from high stability and controlled release of internal component of nanoparticles that improve cellular delivery, lymphoid organ targeting and sustainable DC activation.

Pathogen-associated molecular patterns-type adjuvants contain microbial molecules that trigger inflammation and dendritic cell maturation through pattern recognition receptors. A third type of adjuvant consists of nanoparticles or emulsions optimized to deliver antigen efficiently to dendritic cells or alternatively to prolong the release of antigen into the body. Different types of adjuvants may be combined to maximize their effect.","publish_time":1594339200000,"author_summary":" Tizard, Ian R.","abstract_summary":" Adjuvants are added to vaccines to increase<br>their potency.

However, with rapid increases in international travel, globalization, geographic spread of viral vectors, and widespread use of vaccines, there is an increasing need to consider how pre-exposure to viruses which share similar antigenic regions can impact vaccine efficacy. Pre-existing antibodies, derived from either from maternal\u2013fetal transmission, or by previous infection or vaccination, have been demonstrated to interfere with vaccine immunogenicity of measles, adenovirus, and influenza LAVs. Immune interference of LAVs can be caused by the formation of virus\u2013antibody complexes that neutralize virus infection in antigen-presenting cells, or by the cross-linking of the B-cell receptor with the inhibitory receptor, Fc\u03b3RIIB. On the other hand, pre-existing antibodies can augment flaviviral LAV efficacy such as that of dengue and yellow fever virus, especially when pre-existing antibodies are present at sub-neutralizing levels. The increased vaccine immunogenicity can be facilitated by antibody-dependent enhancement of virus infection, enhancing virus uptake in antigen-presenting cells, and robust induction of innate immune responses that promote vaccine immunogenicity. This review examines the literature on this topic and examines the circumstances where pre-existing antibodies can inhibit or enhance LAV efficacy. A better knowledge of the underlying mechanisms involved could allow us to better manage immunization in seropositive individuals and even identify possibilities that could allow us to exploit pre-existing antibodies to boost vaccine-induced responses for improved vaccine efficacy.","publish_time":1588896000000,"author_summary":" Mok, Darren Z.
