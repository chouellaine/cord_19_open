In this review, we discuss preliminary data concerning the potential activity of type 1 interferons on SARS-CoV-2, and the relevance of evaluating these molecules in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19.Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can lead to excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but the production of type I interferons, which are key antiviral mediators, is reportedly blunted.Here, we argue that targeting IL-17 is immunologically plausible as a strategy to prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and discuss why we think that a clinical trial of a drug in this class could be a logical addition to the effort to find effective therapies.We suggest to pay more attention to the dysregulated IFN-I production in COVID-19 and to considerate cGAS, ALK and STING as potential therapeutic targets preventing cytokine storm.Approved drugs like suramin and ALK inhibitors are worthy of clinical trials.Regulating the upstream of the cytokines production could be a promising strategy to the treatment of COVID-19.", "title_summ": "Regulation of interferon production as a potential strategy for COVID-19 treatmentCOVID-19: a case for inhibiting IL-17?Type 1 interferons as a potential treatment against COVID-19Dysregulation of type I interferon responses in COVID-19", "title_abstract_phrases": "Type 1 interferons as a potential treatment against COVID-19Abstract Type 1 interferons have a broad antiviral activity in vitro and are currently evaluated in a clinical trial to treat MERS-CoV.
