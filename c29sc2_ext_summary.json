    Adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells for the treatment of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation.Regenerative medicine offers various cell-tissue therapeutics and related products, such as stem cell therapy, natural killer (NK) cell therapy, Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, exosomes, and tissue products.
    
    Because H7N9 and the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) share similar complications (such as ARDS and lung failure) and corresponding multi-organ dysfunction, MSC-based therapy could be a possible alternative for treating COVID-19.
    
    Mesenchymal stem cells in the fight against viruses: face to face with the invisible enemyThe relative ease of isolation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from different tissues coupled with their culture expansion in vitro and their differentiation capacity to mesodermal, endodermal and ectodermal lineages have made these cells attractive for a large number of therapeutic applications.
    
    Can Stem Cells Beat COVID-19: Advancing Stem Cells and Extracellular Vesicles Toward Mainstream Medicine for Lung Injuries Associated With SARS-CoV-2 InfectionsA number of medicines are currently under investigation for the treatment of COVID-19 disease including anti-viral, anti-malarial, and anti-inflammatory agents.
    
    Despite advances in supportive care approaches, ARDS is still associated with high mortality and morbidity."
