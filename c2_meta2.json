Such an understanding of digital entrepreneurship is perceived as a key pillar for economic growth, job creation and innovation. However, a number of issues regarding digital entrepreneurship and digital transformation are prevalent, inhibiting digital entrepreneurs to optimise the advantages that digital entrepreneurship contributes towards business value. Therefore, the aim of this research paper is to investigate digital entrepreneurship and digital transformation, their characteristics and inter-relationships. Data extracted and analysed through a structured analysis process, recognises and discusses the characteristics of digital entrepreneurship and digital transformation. The characteristics are reported by employing the Dynamic Capabilities Theory as the structure. By understanding the characteristics of digital entrepreneurship and digital transformation, individuals and organisations may either create new business ventures or transform existing businesses through the development of novel digital technologies or the innovative application of such technologies.",

        "abstract": "Smart manufacturing, Industry 4.0 and Smart Factory are phenomena regarded as a key necessity for Small, Medium and Micro Businesses (SMMEs) worldwide. Even though these 4(th) Industrial Revolution (4IR) phenomena are generally used interchangeably, this paper sought to identify how SMME readiness for smart manufacturing has been investigated through a systematic review. The systematic review was conducted through the lens of Nooteboom, and Tornatzky and Klein\u2019s research on technological innovation in SMMEs based on Rogers\u2019 diffusion of innovations theory. The findings reveal that there is little to no research on smart manufacturing in relation to SMMEs in low-income countries particularly the African continent. The results also show that smart manufacturing is still an emergent phenomenon with disparate definitional challenges. These definitional challenges make the adoption of smart manufacturing innovations a challenge in resource-constrained contexts; but similarly present an opportunity for new definitions and theories in such contexts. The little research often treats SMMEs homogenously and as such misses their important heterogeneous (sector or industry specific) nature. Few research studies investigate SMME awareness (adequate knowledge) or make explicit the benefits (relative advantage) of smart manufacturing. Even fewer studies are explicit on the smart manufacturing technologies that are relevant for different SMME sectors. Smart manufacturing is identified as incompatible with SMME characteristics, that is SMMEs lack expertise\/skills to comprehend the complexity of smart manufacturing, and also lack financial and human resources to implement smart manufacturing. Given that awareness, relative advantage, complexity and compatibility are critical barriers for SMME smart manufacturing readiness\/adoption, there is a critical need for research to focus on these factors in particular for the context of resource constrained low-income country environments.",

Drawing on previously conducted studies and considering current issues and practical experiences both from provider and user perspectives, we propose a framework that would identify, rank and recommend cloud services from multiple modules and components to individual consumers. Furthermore, we contribute an early-stage design of a cloud broker framework that considers cloud-service consumers\u2019 sourcing preferences while making new cloud-sourcing decisions and that can be used in the selection and adoption phase of implementing cloud services and\/or as part of a multicloud strategy.",

However, before implementing such an FC, teachers face the challenge of creating content in the form of materials and activities and finding a suitable development method. This is very time-consuming, which is why circumstances such as lack of time and personnel can make implementation difficult. In other areas, agile approaches have already proven to be effective in enabling flexible and efficient development. We use this opportunity to overcome different barriers in the context of FC development by creating an agile model for FC development. To achieve this, we first examined the previous research on agile development approaches concerning the implementation of an FC by a systematic literature review, concluding that no appropriate model exists yet. Building upon this, we designed an Agile(FC) Development Model, which can be used by teachers to create their FC. This model is very generally designed so that it can be easily adopted. On the other hand, it can be adjusted to a particular situation without effort. We also illustrate the application of the model using a small case study.",

In this paper, we conducted a systematic literature review to identify all I4.0-related organisational aspects, such as an I4.0-relevant strategy, digital business model innovation, technology investment optimisation, workforce management complexity, digital eco-systems, technology-centric convergence, virtual model and physical environment linkage, value chain digitalisation and product portfolio innovation. Furthermore, we presented these I4.0 organisational aspects identified in a conceptual model based on the components of organisational strategic alignment.

        "abstract": "Enterprise Architecture (EA) has had an interesting and often controversial history since its inception in the late 80\u2019s by pioneers such as John Zachman. Zachman proposed the Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture (ZFEA), a descriptive, holistic representation of an enterprise for the purposes of providing insights and understanding. Some scholars claim that EA is an imperative to ensure successful business structures or business-IT alignment, or more recently with Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM), to manage required organizational transformation. However, EA initiatives within companies are often costly and the expected return on investment is not realized. In fact, Gartner recently indicated in their 2018 Enterprise Architecture Hype Cycle that EA is slowly emerging from the trough of disillusionment after nearly a decade. In this paper we argue that the role and value of EA is often misunderstood, and that EA, specifically the ZFEA for the purpose of this paper, could be considered as a theory given the view of theory within Information Systems (IS). The purpose of IS theories is to analyse, predict, explain and\/or prescribe and it could be argued that EA often conform to these purposes. Using the taxonomy of theories as well as the structural components of theory within IS as proposed by Gregor, we motivate that the ZFEA could be regarded as an explanatory theory. Positioning ZFEA as IS explanatory theory provides insight into the role and purpose of the ZFEA (and by extension EA), and could assist researchers and practitioners with mediating the challenges experienced when instituting EA and EAM initiatives within organizations.",

In this context, new concepts such as digital connectivity, interconnection, and interoperability emerged as highly disruptive approaches for logistics systems and supply chain management (SCM). To shed more light on these complexities and see how companies organized in a SCM model can adopt, implement and operate in a digital connectivity model, this study proposes a framework, namely SIMPLE. To develop the framework, we employed a literature review approach, focusing on recent studies published in journals. After the literature analysis, six dimensions related to digital connectivity in supply chains and logistics emerged, namely Smart, Innovative, Measurable, Profitable, Lean, and Excellence (SIMPLE). This framework brings opportunities for future studies, while providing important insights into the dynamics of digital connectivity in logistics and supply chains. Therefore, these SIMPLE framework dimensions should enable the actors involved in organizations\u2019 operations to interact adequately and harmoniously so as to maximize the value generated in the network.",

The proposed framework was evaluated by an experienced programme director and its applicability was tested against a large scale IS outsourcing project.

Asset management organizations are by nature data intensive to manage their assets like bridges, dykes, railways and roads. For this, they often implement data lakes using a variety of architectures and technologies to store big data and facilitate data science initiatives. However, the decision-outcomes of data science models are often highly reliant on the quality of the data. The data in the data lake therefore has to be of sufficient quality to develop trust by decision-makers. Not surprisingly, organizations are increasingly adopting data governance as a means to ensure that the quality of data entering the data lake is and remains of sufficient quality, and to ensure the organization remains legally compliant. The objective of the case study is to understand the role of data governance as success factor for data science. For this, a case study regarding the governance of data in a data lake in the asset management domain is analyzed to test three propositions contributing to the success of using data science. The results show that unambiguous ownership of the data, monitoring the quality of the data entering the data lake, and a controlled overview of standard and specific compliance requirements are important factors for maintaining data quality and compliance and building trust in data science products.",

In this research, we attempt to explore research streams and trends by analyzing why existing studies were conducted, what outcomes were produced, and what methods were used in these studies. Starting from these three questions, a thematic framework was developed, and a literature synthesis was presented. The result shows the complexity of this area, the importance of balancing technical factors and non-technical factors, the challenges brought by non-functional requirements. Despite the importance of EA frameworks, few studies have been found in which government or city relevant requirements were addressed in a general way. Such findings are expected to provide useful insights for possible future research in this area.",

To address this issue, the main objective of this research is to identify BDA implementation considerations for new BDA endeavors that will help organisations to align their BDA efforts with their overall business strategy to maximize business value. Based on a Benefit Dependency Network (BDN) model as main theoretical underpinning, a structured literature review was conducted focusing on investment objectives, business benefits, enabling changes and IT enablers when implementing BDA. A BDA implementation requires a holistic approach by considering aspects such as the skills of people which will have an impact on the structure of the organisation, business processes and technology changes to deliver benefits and investment objectives. Each of the domains of the BDN should be considered prior to BDA implementations. The research offers a guideline to organisations implementing BDA, based on the foundation of BDN.",

To address this problem, we performed exploratory single-case study research at one large established software vendor. We gathered and analyzed the key challenges of tracking and documenting open source dependencies in products. We wanted to understand whether these ad-hoc solutions could be based on a single unified conceptual model for managing dependencies. Our study suggests that underlying the various point solutions that we found at this vendor lies a conceptual model that we tentatively call the product (architecture) model. In future cross-vendor work, we will investigate whether this conceptual model can be expanded to become a unifying model for all open source dependency management.",

        "abstract": "Increasing amount of data the organizations worldwide have at their disposal lead to the need to structure, organize and present the information obtained from it. That is because, in today\u2019s rapid-changing business environment, managers and executives need to be able to gain crucial insights about the ongoing project in as little time as possible. Recently, energy efficiency has become a greater field of research, and companies started concentrating on monitoring energy-related metrics. In addition, many of them have built their own internal tools (dashboards) to do just this. However, one of the major drawbacks of building specialized tools is the lack of adaptability. That is, they are often tailored to only one person (e.g. CEO), or a small group of them (e.g. board of directors, managers). Furthermore, the combination of metrics that is displayed to them does not change over time. This is a problem because most likely there exists a better metric combination that would allow users to get the crucial insights faster. To fill this gap, our ongoing research focuses on making the dashboards adaptable to multiple roles within the organization while optimizing for a certain goal. In some scenarios the dashboard\u2019s goal may be to detect defects, in others it may be to generate the most profit. As our primary research interest is to amplify energy efficiency, we have chosen that to be our dashboard\u2019s goal. Our previous work suggests that in order to handle compound metrics at scale it is needed to represent the dashboard as a complex system. This paper presents the design and the architecture of our proposed solution synergizing the notions from complexity theory, software architecture and user experience (UX) design.",

KAOS goal modelling is a software engineering approach that allows to identify high level goals of an organisation, refine and expand them into lower-level more concrete goals and assign them to specific system agents. The two approaches can be combined, such that the goal modelling is used to derive specific goals rooted in the organisational context, policies and strategies of an organisation. The GQM, in turn, utilises the derived specific goals to produce appropriate and meaningful metrics that can be used to obtain valuable insights and track the state and progress of the formulated goals. Moreover, both models can be presented within a single diagram, thus providing an expressive and concise overview of the systems goals, actors and measurements. The suggested combination is then applied in the context of an open source project, followed by the discussion on potential benefits and drawbacks of using the two approaches.",

This exploratory approach is based on information, whilst information systems and services contribute to developing new practices, creating new situations, generating new added value. In this perspective, information and knowledge can be viewed as information common good, which is in the heart of service design. It is essential that services are designed in an exploratory way, by involving multidisciplinary, multi-institutional, even multi-national actors, whose active participation would lead to the development of new value-added services. This can be done thanks to a protected place adapted to co-construction of information services, Tiers-Lieu for Services (TLS).

Information systems must participate in the collective effort to move towards sustainable development, and software and application companies must lead a CSR strategy to achieve this aim. Moreover, beyond an individual company approach, sustainability should be seen as an integral quality of any software (as well as safety, performance or reliability). All of this seem obvious at a time when applications and programs of all kinds are ubiquitous in everyday life. Nevertheless, the challenges of sustainable development have still not been considered in certain key sectors such as the development of information technology.

Indeed, digital participation allows people to be involved in different societal activities at an unprecedented scale through the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Still, enabling participation at scale requires making it seamless for people to: interact with a variety of software platforms, get information from connected physical objects and software services, and communicate and collaborate with their peers. Toward this objective, this paper introduces and formalizes the concept of Social Participation Network, which captures the diverse participation relationships \u2013 between people, digital services and connected things \u2013 supporting participatory processes. The paper further presents the early design of an associated online service to support the creation and management of Social Participation Networks. The design advocates the instantiation of Social Participation Networks within distinct participation contexts\u2014spanning, e.g., private institutions, neighbor communities, and governmental institutions\u2014so that the participants\u2019 information and contributions to participation remain isolated and private within the given context.",

This includes limitations in interfaces, search capabilities, provision of quality information and the lack of definite standards and implementation guidelines. Many Semantic Web specifications and technologies are specifically designed to address the publication of data on the web. In addition, many official publication bodies encourage and foster the development of Open Data standards based on Semantic Web principles. However, no existing solution for managing Open Data takes full advantage of these possibilities and benefits. In this paper, we present our solution \u201cPiveau\u201d, a fully-fledged Open Data management solution, based on Semantic Web technologies. It harnesses a variety of standards, like RDF, DCAT, DQV, and SKOS, to overcome the barriers in Open Data publication. The solution puts a strong focus on assuring data quality and scalability. We give a detailed description of the underlying, highly scalable, service-oriented architecture, how we integrated the aforementioned standards, and used a triplestore as our primary database. We have evaluated our work in a comprehensive feature comparison to established solutions and through a practical application in a production environment, the European Data Portal.

        "abstract": "A number of qualitative studies find that team leadership is one essential success factor for evolving into a mature agile team. One such qualitative study suggests the 9-Factor Theory of Scrum Master roles, which claims that the Scrum Master performs a set of 9 leadership roles which are transferred to the team over time [14]. We aimed at conducting a quantitative exploration that examines the presence and change of the 9-Factor Theory in relation to team maturity. We conducted an online survey with 67 individuals at the conglomerate Robert Bosch GmbH. Descriptive statistics reveal that the Scrum Master and the agile team score differently on the 9 factors and that the Scrum Master role is most often distributed in teams that had been working between 3 and 5 months in an agile manner. Yet, we also find that the leadership roles predominantly remain with one dedicated Scrum Master. Based on our results we suggest to group the 9-Factor Theory into three clusters: the Scrum Master is rather linked to psychological team factors (1), while the team tends to be linked to rather product-related factors (2). Organizational factors (3) are less often present. Our practical implications suggest an extension of the Scrum Master description. Furthermore, our study lays groundwork for future quantitative testing of leadership in agile teams.",

An activity is closely defined, and six generic activities associated with all agile implementations are identified.

Evidence is gathered from participant interviews and the framework is used to surface learning and development obstacles and issues within an expansive learning cycle. The study argues that analysis via this modified AT framework brings original insight. Initial findings indicate that there are relatively few learning and development issues associated with the use of agile tools and techniques themselves and that most problems arise at the interface where the \u201cchanged\u201d (more agile) delivery teams meet the organisation\u2019s behavioural norms and practices.",

Due to their unique nature, AI based systems influence a wide range of stakeholders with or without their consent, and thus the development of these systems necessitates a higher degree of ethical consideration than is currently carried out in most cases. Various practical examples of AI failures have also highlighted this need. However, there is only limited research on methods and tools for implementing AI ethics in software development, and we currently have little knowledge of the state of practice. In this study, we explore the state of the art in startup-like environments where majority of the AI software today gets developed. Based on a multiple case study, we discuss the current state of practice and highlight issues. The cases underline the complete ignorance of ethical consideration in AI endeavors. We also outline existing good practices that can already support the implementation of AI ethics, such as documentation and error handling.",

Applying an effective risk management is in the nature of agile methods. However, when multiple agile teams work on the same product, a higher coordination effort is required and more formal practices are applied. The objective of this paper is to study how risk management can be improved in a scaled agile environment. Therefore, we conducted a case study in a large-sized ecommerce company and interviewed several project managers. The results show that there are differences for risk management in terms of two contexts. On the one hand, informal risk management is rated as good enough for one autonomous team. On the other hand, more formal approaches are needed, when several teams work on the same requirement. Furthermore, a tool for the support of risk management in a scaled agile environment is presented. We can conclude that hybrid development approaches consisting of agile practices and traditional practices, are beneficial, when several teams work in parallel.",

Critical analysis of related studies suggests that impeding behaviors are mostly rooted in the hierarchical culture of Indian organizations and related management behavior of command-and-control. But what happens in distributed projects with a more empowering onshore management? In this paper, we present the findings from a multiple-case study of DevOps teams with members from a mature agile company located in Sweden and a more hierarchical offshore vendor from India. Based on two focus groups we list culturally different behaviors of offshore engineers that were reported to impede agile ways of working. Furthermore, we report the findings from surveying 36 offshore team members from five DevOps teams regarding their likely behavior in situations reported to be problematic. Our findings confirm a number of previously reported behaviors rooted in cultural differences that impede the adoption of agile ways of working when collaborating with offshore engineers. At the same time, our survey results suggest that among the five surveyed teams there were teams that succeeded with the cultural integration of the offshore team members. Finally, our findings demonstrate the importance of cultural training especially when onboarding new team members.",

The first step of an experiment-based approach is to elicit hypotheses to guide experiments. Software startups base their products on business assumptions, but there is a lack of understanding of how these assumptions are formed and how teams could elicit hypotheses systematically. To fill this gap, we performed an empirical study consisted of two steps. First, we explored based on which assumptions startups define their products using a multiple case study. The results indicate that these companies developed their products based on founders\u2019 assumptions derived from their previous experience.

We investigated these teams for six months, from the moment that team members were trained on the job to grasp the essence of using the integrated approach inspired on Pivotal Labs proposal to the time they were considered mature enough to share their experiences with others within the organization. Through our in-depth study, we illustrate how this adoption promotes changes regarding to mindset, activities, practices, and techniques.

        "abstract": "Nowadays, software is ubiquitous and present in almost everything we buy and use. Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming prevalent in software products. The use of AI entices consumer inquisitiveness, promising software products that can make our lives easier, productive, and in some mission-critical applications safer. Similar reasoning can be applied to systems exploring Internet of Things, cloud services, and mobile technologies. However, there is a trust deficit when it comes to accepting AI as well as the other above-mentioned features, as a reliable technology platform. This paper argues that the more critical the domain is, the less consumers seem to trust software to make decisions on their behalf or even to be used. Aspects such as safety, privacy, and ethics challenges the perception of trustworthy computing. In the past two decades, several works have suggested that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) may play an essential role in creating a trust paradigm between customers and businesses promoting loyalty, customer retention and thus enhancing customer trust and increasing corporate profit. We believe that the software industry will need soon rather than later to encourage trust in their embedded software. A promising approach lies in adapting principles associated with CSR to guide the software development processes. Such an approach could help to achieve two goals: Deliver trustworthy software and, if desired, deliver socially responsible software. We believe that Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) will play a crucial role in this endeavor. This paper highlights a first approach to establishing a basic set of NFRs that should always be carefully considered when developing software, as to aim socially responsible software.",

Software quality correlates with the success of requirements engineering (RE) sessions.

These activities are mostly performed manually, which causes process delays and software quality attributes like reliability, usability, comprehensibility, etc., are diminished causing software devaluation. Innovative aspects. This research idea paper proposes a framework for automating the tasks of requirements specification.

The innovative aspect of this research comes from digitally transforming the software development life cycle (SDLC) where requirements are generated \u201con the fly\u201d and virtual reality systems are in place. Potential to make change. The proposed framework has the potential to renovate the role of software analysts, which can experience substantial reduction of manual tasks, more efficient communication, dedication to more analytical tasks, and assurance of software quality from conception phases.

However, it is defined so broadly, so holistically, that companies find it challenging to improve it through well-defined projects with an impact analysis of the different changes that could be brought about. Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM) is supposed to be a suitable means to support the management of such transformation projects. However, the depth and disruptive nature of these changes raise multiple questions concerning the adequacy of EAM for Customer Experience Improvement (CEI). In current corporate practice, there seems to be no regular application of EAM as a central support service for CEI in the digital context. In this paper, we explore how EAM can support CEI and examine how digitalization transforms the customer experience. We further identify the required information inputs for these transformations. Based on this foundation, we identify content elements that EAM can provide by analyzing EAM meta-models. Comparing the requirements by CEI projects and the supply by EAM shows that EAM, in general, provides valuable inputs for organizational issues and roles but shows weaknesses when it comes to information about trends, contextual and environmental information.",

The design and engineering methodology for organizations (DEMO) is an established modelling method for representing the organization domain of an enterprise. However, heterogeneity in enterprise design stakeholders generally demand for transformations between conceptual modelling languages. Specifically, in the case of DEMO, a transformation into business process modelling and notation (BPMN) models is desirable to account to both, the semantic sound foundation of the DEMO models, and the wide adoption of the de-facto industry standard BPMN. Model transformation can only be efficiently applied if tool support is available. Our research starts with a state-of-the-art analysis, comparing existing DEMO modelling tools. Using a design science research approach, our main contribution is the development of a DEMO modelling tool on the ADOxx platform. One of the main features of our tool is that it addresses stakeholder heterogeneity by enabling transformation of a DEMO organization construction diagram (OCD) into a BPMN collaboration diagram. A demonstration case shows the feasibility of our newly developed tool.",

In contemporary, fast-paced markets, business models are volatile in nature and should be continuously innovated to accommodate new customer needs and technology developments. Business model innovation can be considered as an iterative process to guide business models from ideation towards implementation, in which the proper evaluation of business model prototypes is essential. For this evaluation, we need normative guidance, tools and rules to understand the relative performance of a new business model design. In the early design phases, this implies dealing with high levels of uncertainty. A few techniques and methods have been proposed for this purpose, but these lack the formal basis required for systematical application and development of automated evaluation tools. As a novel approach, we have earlier proposed the application of linguistic summarization to support early-phase, soft-quantitative business model evaluation. In this paper, we focus on a structural formalization of this approach as the basis for the development of well-defined user guidelines and automated evaluation tools. In doing so, we bridge the existing gap between qualitative and quantitative business model evaluation. We demonstrate the formalization by means of a running case inspired by a real-world project in the highly dynamic urban mobility domain.",

A total of 302 subjects participated in the research showing that previous expertise impacts the interpretation of landscape elements and designs whereas, in the case of having contextual information, subjects responded more consistently. The results also show that the basic relationships between processes are intuitive to users, also in the case when only proximity between shapes is facilitated. Our findings may imply future designs of languages for process landscapes. They also may be useful for those who actually model process landscape diagrams and search for suitable notations.",

        "abstract": "Failure of IT projects has risen to become an eyesore for most organisations. This is often attributed to the \u2018mum effect\u2019- an individual\u2019s reluctance to report the exact position of troubled software projects. With the increasing digitalization of operations by most State Universities in Zimbabwe, the mum effect has the potential to rise to exponential proportions. Guided by the Design Science approach data was gathered from an intensity sample of 15 participants comprising 7 software project team members, 3 ICT project managers, and 5 users of the system drawn from three Zimbabwean state universities. The data collection was done using key informant interviews and focus group discussions. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and NVivo (version 11) software was used to store, organise, and code data transcripts. Factors suppressing Bad News Reporting were grouped into three broad categories which included organisational factors, personal factors, and situational factors. The findings suggest the need to incorporate these multi-level factors in the design and implementation of software projects if they are to be efficacious. This study recommends the establishment of clear channels of communication to manage bad news reporting and creating formal structures that function outside the traditional organisational hierarchy to convey information regarding anomalies. This study contributes to practice by providing appropriate interventions based on empirical evidence based on the centrality of software project team members\u2019 insights, experiences as well as practices.",

When developing an open platform many architectural design decisions have to be made, which are driven from the companies\u2019 business objectives. The set of decisions results in an overwhelming design space of architectural variabilities. Until now, there are no architectural guidelines and tools that explicitly capture design variabilities of open platforms and their relation to business objectives. As a result, systematic knowledge is missing; platform providers have to fall back to ad-hoc decision-making; this bears consequences such as risks of failure and extra costs. In this paper, we present a pattern-driven approach called SecoArc to model diverse design decisions of open platforms and to analyze and compare alternative architectures with respect to business objectives. SecoArc consists of a design process, a modeling language, and an automated architectural analysis technique. It is implemented and ready-to-use in a tool. We evaluate the approach by means of a real-world case study. Results show that the approach improves the decision-making. Future platform providers can reduce risks by making informed decisions at design time.",

Many approaches to optimal resource allocation have been proposed in the Business Process Management community.

In this article, we propose an approach for recommending unfamiliar activities to employees by comparing their work histories with work histories of other similar employees. The aim of the proposed approach is to put employees on a gradual path of multi-skilling whereby they are provided with an opportunity to perform unfamiliar process activities and thus gain their experience through learning-by-doing. The approach is based on the analysis of process execution data and has been implemented. In the evaluation, we compared recommendations provided by the approach with actual activity executions of different employees recorded in process data.

        "abstract": "The production sector has faced many difficulties in taking full advantage of opportunities found in other web application domains. Production research has focused on sophisticated mathematical models ranging from molecular materials modeling to efficient production control to inter-company supply network logistics. Often, these models have no closed-form solutions; this led to intense simulation research for individual modeling viewpoints, often labeled \u201cDigital Twins\u201d. However, the complexity of the overall system precludes Digital Twins covering more than just a few system perspectives, especially if near-realtime performance is required. Moreover, the wide variety of individual situations and behaviors is usually captured only as statistical uncertainty. In order to achieve better performance and more context adaptation, the interdisciplinary research cluster \u201cInternet of Production\u201d at RWTH Aachen University is exploring the concept of \u201cDigital Shadows\u201d. Digital Shadows can be understood as compact views on dynamic processes, usually combining condensed measurement data with highly efficient simplified mathematical models. In this exploratory paper, we argue based on a couple of initial case studies that Digital Shadows are not just valuable carriers of deep engineering knowledge but due to their small size also help in reducing network congestion and enabling edge computing. These properties could make Digital Shadows an interesting solution to address resilience in other information-intensive dynamic systems.",

        "abstract": "Various technologies have been developed to automate the deployment of applications. Although most of them are not limited to a specific infrastructure and able to manage multi-cloud applications, they all require a central orchestrator that processes the deployment model and executes all necessary tasks to deploy and orchestrate the application components on the respective infrastructure. However, there are applications in which several organizations, such as different departments or even different companies, participate. Due to security concerns, organizations typically do not expose their internal APIs to the outside or leave control over application deployments to others. As a result, centralized deployment technologies are not suitable to deploy cross-organizational applications. In this paper, we present a concept for the decentralized cross-organizational application deployment automation. We introduce a global declarative deployment model that describes a composite cross-organizational application, which is split to local parts for each participant. Based on the split declarative deployment models, workflows are generated which form the deployment choreography and coordinate the local deployment and cross-organizational data exchange. To validate the practical feasibility, we prototypical implemented a standard-based end-to-end toolchain for the proposed method using TOSCA and BPEL.",

It focuses on the analysis of enterprise systems, which are widely used in corporate sectors and are notoriously large, monolithic and challenging to manually decouple because they manage asynchronous, user-driven business processes and business objects (BOs) having complex structural relationships. The technique presented leverages semantic knowledge of enterprise systems, i.e., BO structure, together with syntactic knowledge of the code, i.e., classes and interactions as part of static profiling and clustering. On a semantic level, BOs derived from databases form the basis for prospective clustering of classes as modules, while on a syntactic level, structural and interaction details of classes provide further insights for module dependencies and clustering, based on K-Means clustering and optimization. Our integrated techniques are validated using two open source enterprise customer relationship management systems, SugarCRM and ChurchCRM. The results demonstrate improved feasibility of remodularizing enterprise systems (inclusive of coded BOs and classes) as microservices. Furthermore, the recommended microservices, integrated with \u2018backend\u2019 enterprise systems, demonstrate improvements in key non-functional characteristics, namely high execution efficiency, scalability and availability.",

        "doi": "10.1007\/978-3-030-43177-8_5",
        "abstract": "Nowadays, the implementation of cloud manufacturing technologies epitomizes the avant-garde in production systems. This affects several aspects of the management of these production systems, in particular scheduling activities, due to the possibility provided by cloud manufacturing of having real-time information about the stages of a product life cycle and about the status of all services. However, so far, cloud manufacturing has mainly focused on machines, with limited interest in material handling systems. This shortfall has been addressed in this study, where a new material-handling paradigm, called Cloud Material Handling System (CMHS) and developed in the Logistics 4.0 Lab at NTNU (Norway), has been introduced. With CMHS, the scheduling of the Material Handling Modules (MHMs) can be optimized, increasing the flexibility and productivity of the overall manufacturing system. To achieve this, the integration of advanced industry 4.0 technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), and in particular Indoor Positioning Technologies (IPT), Cloud Computing, Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI), is required. In fact, based on the relevant information provided on the cloud platform by IPT and IoT for each product, called Smart Object (SO) (position, physical characteristics and so on), an Intelligent Cognitive Engine (ICE) can use ML and AI to decide, in real time, which MHM is most suitable for carrying out the tasks required by these products based on a compatibility matrix, on their attributes, and on the defined scheduling procedure.",

In this paper, we present an event-based approach in a non-intrusive customization framework that can enable customization for multi-tenant SaaS and address the problem of too many API calls to the main software product. The experimental results on Microsoft\u2019s eShopOnContainers show that our approach can empower an event bus with the ability to customize the flow of processing events, and integrate with tenant-specific microservices for customization. We have shown how our approach makes sure of tenant-isolation, which is crucial in practice for SaaS vendors.

        "abstract": "While there is not much discussion on the importance of formally describing and analysing quantitative requirements in the process of software construction; in the paradigm of API-based software systems it could be vital. Quantitative attributes can be thought as attributes determining the Quality of Service \u2013 QoS provided by a software component published as a service. In this sense, they play a determinant role in classifying software artifacts according to specific needs stated as requirements. In previous works we presented an efficient, and fully automatic, analysis technique for establishing Service Level Agreements \u2013 SLA. Such a proposal relays on describing QoS contracts as convex specifications, and compliance checking is performed by the application of an analysis algorithm based on state of the art techniques used in hybrid system verification. Such a technique succeeds in offering a procedure for determining SLA but fails in the more realistic scenario where, potentially, no service fully satisfies the requirements. In this scenario the running application may still prefer to invoke the service that offers the best chances of successfully executing with values for QoS attributes meeting the requirements satisfactorily. In this work we propose and implement a metric for automatically quantifying partial satisfaction of QoS requirements, leading to a way of ranking services according to such notion of partial compliance.",

In a decentralized blockchain, the state of smart contracts is collaboratively maintained by a peer-to-peer network of mutually untrusted nodes, which collect from users a set of transactions (representing the required actions on contracts), and execute them in some order. Once this sequence of transactions is appended to the blockchain, the other nodes validate it, re-executing the transactions in the same order. The serial execution of transactions does not take advantage of the multi-core architecture of modern processors, so contributing to limit the throughput.

Based on this, we show how static analysis of smart contracts can be exploited to parallelize the execution of transactions.",

By conducting a text analysis on these clusters, we identify the main themes and provide insights regarding article relevance, theoretical frameworks, and methodologies for each cluster. In addition, we categorize the themes within each cluster into three main groups of Matured, Developing, and Emerging. Based on the identified Emerging categories, we provide detailed discussions on the promising avenues for research and practice in three main areas of Sustainable SCRM, Behavioral SCRM, and nascent methodologies and theories in SCRM studies.

There are many solutions allowing software architecture design. In this paper, we use software design patterns as a solution. This is due to their reusable software elements. Our principal objective is to propose other alternatives to the informal visual description of software architectures. In past work, we have studied Service Oriented Architectures. We used SOA design patterns with standard formal notations. This work is a continuation to the past one. We apply our approach on design patterns for the Internet of Things. We introduce a refinement-based approach for modeling IoT design patterns. It takes advantage of graphical modeling and formal method. It is organized around two main axes. The first axis is to provide modeling solutions in conformance with the UML standard language. The second axis covers the general specification of design pattern models with the Event-B method. As a result, we propose a design support tool for IoT architectures based on IoT design patterns. It allows modeling of correct-by-design software systems.",

Although there have been several studies on the factors affecting the reuse of building components, there is no single study that has tried to harmonize the circumstances affecting this intervention. Through a systematic literature review targeting peer-reviewed journal articles, this study intends to identify and stratify factors affecting the reuse of components of the superstructure of a building and eventually delineate correlations between these factors. Factors identified throughout this study are classified into six major categories and 23 sub-categories. Then the inter-dependencies between the barriers are studied by developing the correlation indices between the sub-categories. Results indicate that addressing the economic, social and regulatory barriers should be prioritized. Although the impact of barriers under perception, risk, compliance and market sub-categories are very pronounced, the highest inter-dependency among the sub-categories is found between perception and risk. It suggests that the perception of the stakeholders about building components reuse is affected by the potential risks associated with this intervention.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Often today\u2019s designers are relegated to degrade their own output to realize mass production on existing manufacturing capital equipment. These considerations are typically encoded in the design process through \u201cDesign for Manufacturing\u201d where constraints on the production processes available and limits to each manufacturing approach are ideally considered early in design. This Design for Manufacturing guise inhibits true designer creativity and the possibility to realize truly revolutionary products. In this paper, the authors formalize their previous introduction of the concept of Manufacturing for Design (MFD), a framework whereby product design creativity is used instead as a motive force of innovation to rethink manufacturing process approaches and assist in facilitating real innovation in manufacturing. This is not proposed as a replacement for DFM, but an extension that can help \u201cquestion\u201d the manufacturing-based requirements during the development process. It is clear that existing machines cannot be abandoned, but one can instead consider an intermediate augmentation step to feasibly enhance existing capital, to realize new designs in new materials, or to achieve new functional requirements and desires. The blending of MFD and DFM strategies (a proposed MFD|DFM approach) can lead to feasible evolution of manufacturing, and ultimately disruptive process innovation, defined as a rethinking of manufacturing rather than just improvement on existing solutions. Herein is reported the integration of the MFD|DFM concept to two separate education programs, one undergraduate and one graduate. These programs are independent but share resources together with those of an Advanced Manufacturing technical college program to educate students across disciplines and curricula in the dichotomy of Design and Manufacturing, and how the concepts can be properly considered together.",

        "abstract": "Abstract In the wake of industry 4.0, many industries have started to pivot towards digital, collaborative, and smart manufacturing systems by connecting their machinery as part of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT has the potential to provide visibility and improve manufacturing systems through data collection, analysis, and subsequent actions based on insights generated from large amounts of manufacturing data. Even though comparatively newer equipment come readily equipped with embedded sensors and industrial connectivity necessary to connect to the IoT environment, there are many manufacturers (equipment users) who rely on long standing \u201clegacy systems\u201d that offer no or very limited connectivity. In this context, solutions mostly result in the development of low-cost retrofit or upgrade kits that allow integrating legacy equipment into Industry 4.0 environment and thus enable digital servitization. Servitization is a transformation journey that involves firms developing the capabilities they need to provide technical and data-driven services that supplement traditional product offerings. However, retrofitting solutions of legacy equipment rarely involve Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who may otherwise leverage the opportunity to create and capture unique value by retrofitting and then provisioning data-driven value-added services for the manufacturers. Hence, the primary objective of this paper is to identify and analyze the available literature on retrofitting and upgrading of the legacy equipment for Industry 4.0 integration. In doing so, this study also investigates the potential opportunities and challenges of OEMs in supporting the Industry 4.0 transition of legacy equipment in a servitization context.",

We present control metrics to connect with those factors and existing quotation of a product. Since a quotation of product needs a large number of parameters to represent, the control metrics can be alternative of those parameters of quotation. Then, we propose a model of quoting. The correlation between the control metrics and a quotation of product is explored. Finally, a reduction approach of crucial metrics is developed by rough set on incomplete data. The case study is conducted to validate the performance of the proposed method of reduction. The outcomes show that the multiple reducts can be obtained to facilitate the enterprises to make viable quotation decision from the multiple schemes in terms of their characteristics and different demands of the customers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract To stay competitive in the marketplace, manufacturing firms that rely on high product variety should involve the customer in the product design process. However, customer interaction with the product at the design level could compromise the product functionality and the operational arrangement of the manufacturing system. To address these challenges, we aim to align the preferences of the design and manufacturing teams within a manufacturing firm in the context of mass customization. The preference of the design team is in terms of product modularity, associated with product upgradeability and flexibility. In the manufacturing team, complexity is a preference associated with cost and quality. In our research, the motivation for selecting these attributes is that product modularity is used to deal with product variety, and complexity is related to the uncertainty of product manufacturing. These two perspectives could support the manufacturing firm decision of selecting which product architecture is more convenient for a given operational arrangement and vice versa. We use a Multi-Attribute Utility function to assess the preferences of the design and manufacturing teams in terms of modularity and manufacturing complexity. We analyze the functional requirements of the product and then their mapping into the product architecture. Finally, we study the relationship of the product components to the operational arrangement of the manufacturing system. In addition, we include a case study in which we analyze two products and their relationship to a single manufacturing system, where the highest utility produces the best relationship between product design and manufacturing configuration complexity. By using this integrated approach, a manufacturer can decide to update the product design, the related operational configuration, or both.",

This research focuses on establishing whether a relationship exists between the organization\u2019s culture and the capability of team members to engage in structured problem solving practices. Six hypotheses were formulated based on potential relationships between steps required for structured problem solving, and critical organizational culture traits that influence an organization\u2019s problem solving capabilities. A survey was administered to gather data as are necessary for evaluating the hypotheses. Results indicate there is a positive correlation between organizational cultural traits and the ability of team members to engage in structured problem solving practices for continuous improvement. For all hypotheses, the survey results permitted their rejection. This study examined the relationship between one organizational culture trait and one (or a few) problem solving step(s). It is, however, likely that multiple culture traits affect multiple problem solving steps and vice versa. Further studies to examine such relationships can be very useful to help ascertain how best to develop an organizational culture (traits) to succeed and sustain lean transformations. Study findings can guide organizations in their journey towards Lean transformation by helping identify organizational culture traits that must be promoted. Promoting the desired culture traits can create an environment where team members can engage in structured problem solving effectively to help continuous improvement for Lean transformations. The empirical examination of potential relationships between an organization\u2019s cultural traits and the ability of team members to engage in continuous improvement through the problem solving for lean transformations is lacking.

        "abstract": "Abstract In the age of digital manufacturing there is a need to elicit and transfer procedural knowledge between humans and machines. Having proper knowledge is essential in decision-making. The more the knowledge, the better decisions are made. To capture experiences and turn them into knowledge is fundamental in learning processes and knowledge development. Knowledge engineering and knowledge management have been subject for research for decades and several concepts about knowledge and knowledge transfer have been introduced, but a functional approach to exploit knowledge efficiently in manufacturing is still missing. In the era of Industry 4.0, humans and machines must be able to collaborate in such way that both can exploit the best abilities of each other in a manufacturing process. This paper introduces a procedural knowledge process (PKP) approach to capturing and defining unexpected events, while a process step is able to perform its required functions and transfer that information as machine-understandable knowledge about a failure mode. Function blocks (FBs), as per the IEC-61499 standard, have been proposed as a way to achieve distributed process planning in which the manufacturing process can adapt itself to runtime conditions, e.g. machine availability, etc. However, FBs are event-driven systems and the approach is limited to work under well-known runtime conditions, e.g. machine configurations and states, or deviations which are impossible to foresee in advance, for instance the outcome of a process failure mode effects analysis (PFMEA). The PKP introduced in this paper, aims at bridging this gap by integrating at runtime an expert operator\u2019s solution based on root cause analysis (RCA) in an FB architecture, making the FB knowledge-driven systems, for further executions of the same without redesigning it. Natural language representations of procedural knowledge blocks (PKBs) allow to transfer procedural knowledge to human operators, i.e. explain the process flow of a machine decision, while machine representations of PKBs allow to embed procedural knowledge that is elicited from expert operators upon unexpected events into the FBs process. The resulting PKP enhances the FBs for smart industrial applications, such as the process planning use case described in this paper.",

In contrast to development teams operating within a heavily-disciplined software development process, these product teams often require a deeper and, importantly, a collective understanding of the product domain to serve as a rich context within which to understand the product requirements. Little is known about the factors that support or impede these teams in collectively achieving this deep understanding of the product domain. Using Constructivist Grounded Theory method, we study individuals and teams across seven software companies that create products for a diverse range of markets. The study found that certain organisational and planning process factors play a significant role in whether product development teams have the potential to collectively develop deep domain understanding. These factors also impact individual and development team dynamics. We identify two essential metaphorical dynamics of broadening the lens and blurring boundaries that cross-functional product teams employ in order to fully embrace product ownership, visioning, and planning towards achieving a deep collective domain understanding, creating a richer context in which to understand product requirements. We also conclude that the highly specialised nature of many organisational models and development processes is contraindicated for cross-functional product development teams in achieving this deep collective understanding and we call for a rethinking of conventional organisational and product planning practices for software product development.",

        "abstract": "The dissipation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a couple of weeks. The evolution of the disease and its economic impact is highly uncertain, which brings challenges for newly created software companies. Software startups are companies that create innovative software products and services in a dynamic and fast-growing market. Agile Software Methods aims to enable startups in responding to uncertainty caused by Covid-19. This paper investigates the impact of Covid-19 in a real software startup context to understand how they have reacted against uncertainties caused by Covid-19. As a research methodology, action research within Di2Win, a Brazilian software startup, has been applied. The study was carried out throughout six sprints, during the quarantine. Practices employed to mitigate threats while simultaneously allowing teams to remain open to opportunities and challenges are detailed. This paper shares lessons learned that could help agile software startups improve their way of work in an uncertain environment caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.",

To fill this gap, we perform a thorough survey by identifying and classifying the most recent high-quality research outputs that are closely related to the theoretical findings and essential mechanisms of blockchain systems and networks. Several promising open issues are also summarized finally for future research directions.

The expansive growth of cutting-edge technology in the blockchain industry outlines the need and opportunity for addressing oracle consensus in a manner both technologically and economically efficient as well as futureproof. Blockchain-agnosticism is inherently limited if proposing a technological solution involves adding one more architectural layer. As such, Gravity protocol is designed to be a truly blockchain-agnostic protocol. By ensuring parity through direct integration and by leveraging the stability and security of the respective interconnected ecosystems, Gravity circumvents the need for a dedicated, public blockchain and a native token. Ultimately, Gravity protocol intends to address scalability challenges by providing a solid infrastructure for the creation of gateways, cross-chain applications, and sidechains. This paper introduces and defines the concept of Oracle Consensus and its implementation in the Gravity protocol named the Pulse Consensus algorithm.

The paper explains the blockchain technology and a variety of its implementation through five different use cases in the field of drug supply chain, health insurance, land record management, courier services, and immigration records. The immigration blockchain is also proposed as a solution to check pandemic like the coronavirus (COVID-19) effectively. The implementation of the Blockchain is performed using a locally built IBM\u2019s hyper-ledger fabric-based platform, and Ethereum public platform. The results are encouraging enough to substitute existing business operations using Blockchain-based solutions.",

The scopes of building adaptation projects vary, and may include rehabilitating failing structures, improving environmental performances, and changing functional uses. In order to address multiple aspects of building adaptation, different terminologies are used in the literature and in practice, including refurbishment, retrofitting, rehabilitation, renovation, restoration, modernization, conversion, adaptive reuse, material reuse, conservation, and preservation, amongst others. These terminologies are often used interchangeably with overlapping definitions, causing a lack of clarity in the addressed scope of work. An extensive literature review of terminologies related to building adaptation was conducted and the most common and applicable terminologies were identified. Recent definitions, applications, and scope for the identified terminologies are reviewed. Based on this classification, a definition framework is developed enabling precise categorization of building adaptation projects, and application is demonstrated in multiple case studies. The proposed definition framework is a valuable reference for future researchers and practitioners to clearly and consistently define the scope of work in their building adaption projects, and thus avoid the high costs arising from codes, specifications, and project descriptions that confuse these definitions.",

In particular, we discuss a distributed scenario where nurses, technicians and medical doctors belonging to different hospitals cooperate through their federated hospital Clouds to form a virtual health team able to carry out a healthcare workflow in secure fashion leveraging the intrinsic security features of the Blockchain technology. In particular, both public and hybrid Blockchain scenarios are discussed and assessed using the Ethereum platform.",

Our call for papers to this special issue invited original studies to go further and advance our thinking on the strategic implications of this layered evolution of workplace technologies on work and the structure of organisations. In this introduction, we synthesise the main themes from the special issue, and also ongoing dialogues with the growing community at the regular AIS \/ IFIP 9.1 workshop on the Changing Nature of Work. A key observation is that the work involved in configuring emergent Digital\/Human configurations, is vastly under-reported and poorly understood. Paradoxically, this configuring work is the most demanding and critical in the shaping of modern organisations. We suggest that this type of largely invisible work requires engagement beyond the level of execution or even the meaning of work, it requires intervening with third order effects that get to the core of what an organisation is. We highlight the challenges for organisations in dealing with third order change, particularly because these effects are beyond existing frames of reference and require more dynamic and supple responses based on the values, purpose andintent dominantin the organisation \u2013 we describe this as structural digital work. Leaders that are unable or unwilling to engage with effects at this level, and this type of work, will miss identifying core opportunities and risks associated with digital transformation emerging in organisations. We also reflect on the value of current theories and methods used to research this important and emergent phenomenon.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Customer relationship management (CRM) is an innovative technology that seeks to improve customer satisfaction, loyalty, and profitability by acquiring, developing, and maintaining effective customer relationships and interactions with stakeholders. Numerous researches on CRM have made significant progress in several areas such as telecommunications, banking, and manufacturing, but research specific to the healthcare environment is very limited. This systematic review aims to categorise, summarise, synthesise, and appraise the research on CRM in the healthcare environment, considering the absence of coherent and comprehensive scholarship of disparate data on CRM. Various databases were used to conduct a comprehensive search of studies that examine CRM in the healthcare environment (including hospitals, clinics, medical centres, and nursing homes). Analysis and evaluation of 19 carefully selected studies revealed three main research categories: (i) social CRM \u2018eCRM\u2019; (ii) implementing CRMS; and (iii) adopting CRMS; with positive outcomes for CRM both in terms of patients relationship\/communication with hospital, satisfaction, medical treatment\/outcomes and empowerment and hospitals medical operation, productivity, cost, performance, efficiency and service quality. This is the first systematic review to comprehensively synthesise and summarise empirical evidence from disparate CRM research data (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed) in the healthcare environment. Our results revealed that substantial gaps exist in the knowledge of using CRM in the healthcare environment. Future research should focus on exploring: (i) other potential factors, such as patient characteristics, culture (of both the patient and hospital), knowledge management, trust, security, and privacy for implementing and adopting CRMS and (ii) other CRM categories, such as mobile CRM (mCRM) and data mining CRM.",

        "abstract": "FinTech (Financial Technology) and Blockchain are prevalent topics among technology leaders in finance today. This article describes the impact and revolution of FinTech and Blockchain in the financial industry and demonstrates the main characteristics of such technology. Then, we present three critical challenges as well as three ethical issues about using Blockchain technology. Next, we discuss the development of Blockchain for the financial sector. In addition, we describe the real motivations for banks to explore Blockchain, and problems they face. In order to have a good understanding of the industry, a qualitative method was adopted, and sixteen experts were interviewed. It was identified that knowledge hiding in Blockchain was common and the rationale behind was analyzed using the TPB (Theory of Planned Behavior) approach. The analysis results suggested that knowledge hiding was due to affective, behavioral and cognitive evaluations. The interviewees also provided several recommendations and success factors to overcome current issues in Blockchain adoption. Therefore, four important propositions have been developed. Finally, this article suggests how financial services should respond to this new technology and how to manage knowledge sharing in a more structured way. This article contributes to the literature related to the current entrepreneurial finance landscape for Blockchain.",

A key aspect of the transformation has been increased digitalization and the accelerated implementation of previously predicted trends that have been discussed for many years in the information management literature. Human endeavour has encouraged us to adapt to the \u201cnew normal\u201d through immediate necessity in areas such as work, education, healthcare, entertainment and leisure, and online commerce. This new environment has provided unprecedented opportunities for the information management research community to develop research that will have a significant impact on practice in these and other areas. We are essentially at the pinnacle of new developments in the digital space and must seek to develop exemplars that can help to signpost the future direction of digital global society for the benefit of all. Notwithstanding, the problems of digitalization have also been exacerbated and must be further understood and ameliorated in the post-COVID world. This paper examines opportunities and problems in information management brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. It details implications for research and practice.",

        "abstract": "Business models have being designed, worldwide, to create sustainability competencies and in particular to incorporate reverse logistics, but Brazilian executives have not yet fully adhered to Law 12,305 on solid waste and reverse logistics. What would be the Brazilian executives' perception about reverse logistics competency and the support provided by a collaborative and IT competency? The objective of the paper is to investigate the effects of collaboration and IT competency in developing reverse logistics competency, as a strategy, and its consequences in economic and environmental performance. A survey was performed with 320 Brazilian supply chain executives and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. The models demonstrated that collaboration has a direct positive influence on the development of reverse logistics competency, by executives' point of view. The moderation effect between collaboration and IT competency for reverse logistics was not confirmed, since it was adopted a strategic view of reverse logistics. Therefore, despite there was not a moderation effect, IT presented a lower direct effect on reverse logistics competency. Results reinforce that organizations that develop reverse logistics competency tend to improve their economic and environmental performances.",
