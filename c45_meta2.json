Recent trauma society guidelines suggesting that all children over 15 years old should receive thromboprophylaxis may result in overtreatment. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of a previously published VTE prediction algorithm and compare it to current recommendations. METHODS: Two institutional trauma registries were queried for all pediatric (age < 18 years) patients admitted from 2007 to 2018. Clinical data were applied to the algorithm and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was calculated to test algorithm efficacy. RESULTS: A retrospective review identified 8271 patients with 30 episodes of VTE (0.36%). The VTE prediction algorithm classified 51 (0.6%) as high risk (> 5% risk), 322 (3.9%) as moderate risk (1\u20135% risk) and 7898 (95.5%) as low risk (< 1% risk). AUROC was 0.93 (95% CI 0.89\u20130.97). In our population, prophylaxis of the \u2018moderate-\u2019 and \u2018high-risk\u2019 cohorts would outperform the sensitivity (60% vs. 53%) and specificity (96% vs. 77%) of current guidelines while anticoagulating substantially fewer patients (373 vs. 1935, p < 0.001).

PURPOSE: To investigate CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) findings of PTE in COVID-19 and its association with clinical and radiological conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study includes 109 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who underwent CTPA for suspected PTE from March 20 to May 3, 2020. Data were collected from our PACS. CTPA findings of PTE were evaluated. Based on the presence or absence of PTE, patients were divided in two groups and the clinical and radiological conditions were compared using Mann-Whitney U test and \u03c7(2) test. RESULTS: Study population comprised 82M\/19F, mean age 64.1\u00b115.0 [95% confidence interval CI:60.4-67.6] years. CTPAs were performed 19.8\u00b16.1 [95% CI:18.1-20.2] days after the symptom onset and 10.5\u00b13.8 [95% CI:10.2-12.9] days after the admission. Patients with PTE were 41\/101(40.6%). PTE was mostly bilateral or only right (37\/41[90.2%]), mainly involved segmental (37\/41[90.2%]) or subsegmental (25\/41[61.0%]) arteries, and affected mainly the lower lobes branches (30\/41[73.2%]). Parenchymal segments supplied by segmental arteries with PTE showed a prevalent consolidation pattern (25\/37[67.6%]). Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was present only in 5\/41(12.2%). Comparing groups with and without PTE, no significant difference was observed in age, gender, onset symptoms, comorbidities, tumor history, use of respiratory supports, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and DVT. Conversely, differences were evaluated in CT lesion score (15.7\u00b11.4 [95% CI:15.3-16.1] vs 14.1\u00b11.1 [95% CI:13.8-14.4], p=0.035); d-dimer (p<0.001); lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p<0.001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p=0.042). CONCLUSION: PTE in COVID-19 involves mainly the segmental and sub-segmental arteries of segments affected by consolidations in patients with more severe lung disease. We hypothesize that the development of PTE in COVID-19 might be a pulmonary artery thrombosis due to severe lung inflammation and hypercoagulability rather than thromboembolism.","publish_time":1594252800000,"author_summary":" Cavagna, Enrico; Muratore, Francesco;<br>Ferrari, Fabio","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019<br>(COVID-19) in hospitalized patients is frequently<br>complicated by pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE).

In this opinion report, we examine the published evidence of hematological and hemostatic laboratory derangements in COVID-19 and the interrelated SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammation, with a focussed discussion on platelet count alterations. We explore whether thrombocytopenia could be a potential disease biomarker and we provide recommendations for future studies in this regard.","publish_time":1590451200000,"author_summary":" Amgalan, Ariunzaya; Othman, Maha","abstract_summary":" Severe acute respiratory syndrome<br>coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the<br>coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) which rapidly<br>evolved from an outbreak in Wuhan, China into a pandemic<br>that has resulted in over millions of infections and<br>over hundreds of thousands of mortalities<br>worldwide.

Approach and Results: Medical records of 616 pneumonia patients who were admitted to the Yichang Central People's Hospital in Hubei, China, from January 1 to March 23, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. The patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were treated in the dedicated COVID-19 units, and the patients with CAP were admitted to regular hospital campus. Risks of VTE were assessed using the Padua prediction score. All the patients received pharmaceutical or mechanical VTE prophylaxis. VTE was diagnosed using Duplex ultrasound or computed tomography pulmonary angiogram. Differences between COVID-19 and CAP groups were compared statistically. All statistical tests were 2 sided, and P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All data managements and analyses were performed by IBM SPSS, version 24, software (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL). Of the 616 patients, 256 had COVID-19 pneumonia and 360 patients had CAP. The overall rate of VTE was 2% in COVID-19 pneumonia group and 3.6% in CAP group, respectively (P=0.229). 15.6% of the COVID-19 pneumonia patients and 10% of the CAP patients were categorized as high risk for VTE (Padua score, >4), which were significantly different (P=0.036).

This accumulating body of evidence has centered around case series and often empiric therapies as controlled trials are just getting underway. What is clear is that patients appear to be at higher risk for thrombotic disease states including acute coronary syndrome (ACS), venous thromboembolism (VTE) such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), or stroke.

We suggest that higher, possibly therapeutic levels of anticoagulation might be mandatory for a further subset of patients with COVID-19 where a discrepant evolution of C-reactive protein and D-dimer is observed.

Demographic and clinical data, laboratory data, including ultrasound scans of the lower extremities, and outcome variables were obtained, comparisons were made between DVT and non-DVT groups. Results: Of the 143 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (aged 63 \u00b1 14 years; 74 [51.7%] man), 66 patients developed lower extremity DVT (46.1%, included 23 [34.8%] with proximal DVT and 43 [65.2%] with distal DVT).Compared with patients who with no DVT, patients with DVT were older and had a lower oxygenation index, a higher rate of cardiac injury, and worse prognosis including an increased proportion of deaths (23 [34.8%] vs 9 [11.7%], P = 0.001) and a decreased proportion of patients discharged (32 [48.5%] vs 60 [77.9%], P < 0.001).

This study examined 75 consecutive patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, with specific exclusions. METHODS Almost all patients (pts) admitted to our hospital in the first half of May underwent comprehensive vein ultrasonography. 75 pts (aged 27-92 y, median - 63 y, 36 males and 39 females) with moderate to severe COVID-19 were included in our study. RESULTS Spontaneous echo contrast (decreased blood velocity and blood stasis) was detected in common femoral veins in 53 pts (70.7%). DVT was found in 15 pts (20%). The vast majority of those with DVT (13 pts, 86.7%) had thrombi only in calf veins and ileofemoral thrombosis was detected in 2 pts with DVT (13.3%). There was no significant observed difference between DVT and non-DVT patients with respect to age, underlying diseases, lung CT scores and SpaO2 at admission. There was also no significant observed difference between DVT and non-DVT patients with respect to both \"time from symptoms onset to admission\" and with respect to the majority of lab data.

In COVID-19 pulmonary compliance is preserved despite severe hypoxemia, contrarily to classic ARDS, corroborating the hypothesis that perfusion mismatch may play a significant role in the development of respiratory failure in these patients. Based on this rationale, a series of 27 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital were treated with heparin in doses tailored to clinical severity, ranging from 1 - 2 mg\/kg of enoxaparin BD.

Medical records, including demographic, platelet counts, heparin-involved treatments, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia-(HIT) related laboratory tests, and fatal outcomes of COVID-19 patients were analyzed and compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. Findings Sixty-one critical COVID-19 patients treated in ICU included 15 survivors and 46 nonsurvivors. Forty-one percent of them (25\/61) had severe thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count (PLT) less than 50x109\/L, of whom 76% (19\/25) had a platelet decrease of >50% compared to baseline; 96% of these patients (24\/25) had a fatal outcome. Among the 46 nonsurvivors, 52.2% (24\/46) had severe thrombocytopenia, compared to 6.7% (1\/15) among survivors. Moreover, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) could induce a significant decrease in PLT in 81.3% of critical CRRT patients (13\/16), resulting in a fatal outcome. In addition, a high level of anti-heparin-PF4 antibodies, a marker of HIT, was observed in most ICU patients. Surprisingly, HIT occurred not only in patients with heparin exposure, such as CRRT, but also in heparin-naive patients, suggesting that spontaneous HIT may occur in COVID-19. Interpretation Anti-heparin-PF4 antibodies are induced in critical COVID-19 patients, resulting in a progressive platelet decrease.

Pulmonary embolism as well as microembolisation of vital organs may be direct causes of death in COVID-19 positive individuals.

Objectives To test whether Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) indicates hypercoagulopathy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and whether patients with severe disease have a more pronounced hypercoagulopathy compared with less severely ill patients. Methods COVID-19 positive patients over 18 years admitted to St Gorans Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden were eligible for inclusion. Patients were divided into two groups depending on care level: 1) regular wards or 2) wards with specialized ventilation support. ROTEM was taken as soon after admission to hospital as possible (median day 1 after hospitalization). The data were compared with healthy controls. Results The ROTEM variables Maximum Clot Firmness (EXTEM-MCF and FIBTEM-MCF) were significantly higher in both groups of COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls (p<0.001) and higher in severely ill patients compared with patients at regular wards (p<0.05). Coagulation Time (EXTEM-CT) was significantly longer and Clot Formation Time (EXTEM-CFT) significantly shorter in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. Our results suggest that hypercoagulopathy is present in hospitalized patients with mild to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusion ROTEM variables (EXTEM-MCF, FIBTEM-MCF, EXTEM-CT, EXTEM-CFT) were significantly different in COVID-19 patients early after admission compared with healthy controls. This pattern was more pronounced in patients with increased disease severity, suggesting that ROTEM-analysis could be a potentially useful predictor of thromboembolic complications and mortality in these patients.","publish_time":1591920000000,"author_summary":" Almskog, L.; Wikman, A.; Svensson, J.;<br>Wanecek, M.; Bottai, M.; van der Linden, J.; Agren, A.","abstract_summary":" Background High rates of thrombotic events in<br>severely ill COVID-19 patients have been reported.<br>Pulmonary embolism as well as microembolisation of vital<br>organs may be direct causes of death in COVID-19<br>positive individuals.

Methods We evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital. Results We studied 184 ICU patients with proven COVID-19 pneumonia of whom 23 died (13%), 22 were discharged alive (12%) and 139 (76%) were still on the ICU on April 5th 2020. All patients received at least standard doses thromboprophylaxis. The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome was 31% (95%CI 20-41), of which CTPA and\/or ultrasonography confirmed VTE in 27% (95%CI 17-37%) and arterial thrombotic events in 3.7% (95%CI 0-8.2%).

Conclusion The 31% incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections is remarkably high.

OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the incidence of DVT in ICU patients with CoViD-19 compared to non-CoViD-19 ICU patients who were treated in the University Hospital Augsburg during the same period. In addition, the aim was to investigate what type of anticoagulation was present in CoViD-19 patients at the time the DVT occurred and to what extent DVT is associated with increased mortality in this patient population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective single center study, which was conducted between 18 April 2020 and 30 April 2020, 20 SARS-CoV2 positive patients were compared with 20 non-CoVid-19 patients in the ICU with respect to the occurrence of DVT. For this purpose, demographic data, laboratory parameters, and clinical outcomes were recorded and evaluated. RESULTS: The rate of DVT in the investigated patient collective was markedly higher in patients with SARS-CoV2 (CoViD-19 patients 20% vs. non-CoViD-19 patients 5%). Both DVT and elevated D\u2011dimer levels were associated with increased mortality in the present study. CONCLUSION: We recommend the determination of D\u2011dimer levels and, in the case of elevated levels, the broad indication for compression sonography of the deep leg veins on admission of patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV2. In this way DVT in the setting of CoViD-19 can be recognized early and therapeutic anticoagulation can be started. All inpatient CoViD-19 patients should receive thrombosis prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin.

Stratifying risk of COVID-19 thromboses should be based on age, presence of comorbidities, D-dimer, CT scoring, and various blood cell ratios. Isolated heparin therapy may not be sufficient to combat thrombosis in this disease.

Currently, there is great interest to assess venous thrombosis prevalence, diagnosis, prevention, and management in patients with Covid\u201019. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in critically ill patients with Covid\u201019, using lower limbs venous ultrasonography screening. METHODS: Since March 8(th), we enrolled 25 patients, who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infections. The presence of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was systematically assessed by ultrasonography, between day 5 and 10 after admission. The data reported here are those available up until May 9(th) 2020. RESULTS: The mean (\u00b1SD) age of the patients was 68\u00b111 years, 64% were men. No patients had a history of VTE. During the ICU stay, 8 patients (32%) suffered from VTE; 6 (24%) proximal DVT, 5 (20%) pulmonary embolism. The rate of symptomatic VTE was 24%, while 8% of patients had screen\u2010detected DVT.

CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infections, DVT screening at day 5\u201010 of admission, yielded a 32% prevalence of VTE. 75% of events occurred before screening.

The review introduces the interim guidelines of the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) for management of COVID-19-induced coagulopathy, discusses the efficacy of these guidelines in clinical settings, and summarizes the response of the scientific community to these guidelines and their clinical implications. Due to the failure of patients to respond to the prophylactic doses of heparin recommended by ISTH, higher doses of heparin may be necessary to achieve adequate anticoagulation. Patients\u2019 resistance to prophylactic doses of heparin could be due to low levels of anti-thrombin and high levels of fibrinogen, which would reinforce the use of therapeutic doses of heparin in the early stages of hospitalization. The review also compares low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin (UFH) as anticoagulant choices for COVID-19 patients. Given the complications specific to COVID-19, UFH may be a better choice of anticoagulant. Outpatient anticoagulation options are also reviewed. Changing qualified patients from vitamin K antagonists (VKA) to direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) for the convenience of less frequent monitoring may be appropriate. New anticoagulant, nafamostat, used in Japan is also discussed as a possible potentiate for heparin therapy.","publish_time":1589587200000,"author_summary":" Turshudzhyan, Alla","abstract_summary":" As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<br>pandemic is evolving, coagulopathy induced by the<br>disease and its severe complications are raising<br>concerns in the medical community.

SETTING: A multicenter study including three Indianapolis area academic hospitals. PATIENTS: Two-hundred forty consecutive patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were admitted to one of three hospitals. One-hundred nine critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted to the ICU were included in the analysis. INTERVENTIONS: All patients received routine subcutaneous chemical venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome of this study was to determine the frequency of venous thromboembolism and the degree of inflammatory and coagulation marker elevation associated with venous thromboembolism development. Descriptive statistics outlined the frequency of venous thromboembolism at any time during severe coronavirus disease 2019. Clinical course and laboratory metrics were compared between patients that developed venous thromboembolism and patients that did not develop venous thromboembolism. Hypercoagulable thromboelastography was defined as two or more hypercoagulable parameters. MAIN RESULTS: One-hundred nine patients developed severe coronavirus disease 2019 requiring ICU care. The mean (\u00b1 sd) age was 61 \u00b1 16 years and 57% were male. Seventy-five patients (69%) were discharged home, 7 patients (6%) remain in the hospital, and 27 patients (25%) died. Venous thromboembolism was diagnosed in 31 patients (28%) 8 \u00b1 7 days after hospital admission, including two patients diagnosed with venous thromboembolism at presentation to the hospital. Elevated admission d-dimer and peak d-dimer were associated with venous thromboembolism development (p < 0.05). d-dimer greater than 2,600 ng\/mL predicted venous thromboembolism with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.760 (95% CI, 0.661\u20130.858; p < 0.0001), sensitivity of 89.7%, and specificity of 59.5%. Twelve patients (11%) had thromboelastography performed and 58% of these patients had a hypercoagulable study. The calculated coagulation index was hypercoagulable in 50% of patients with thromboelastography. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that coronavirus disease 2019 results in a hypercoagulable state.

Patients admitted with suspicion of COVID-19 were divided into severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative groups based on in-hospital test results. Patients without clinical suspicion for COVID-19 were not tested. A retrospective case-control study design was used to identify potential risk factors for DVT in patients with COVID-19. Demographic, radiographic and laboratory values were abstracted and analyzed. RESULTS: During the study period, 3,404 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to the hospital. Of the 135 SARS-CoV-2 patients who underwent duplex scanning, there were 18 (13.3%) noted to have DVT compared to 72 of the 711 patients (10.1%) who were either SARS-CoV-2 negative or untested. The odds ratio for DVT in COVID-19 was 1.35 (95% CI 0.78 \u2013 2.34, p=0.289). Baseline characteristics for COVID-19 patients with and without DVT were overall similar. COVID-19 patients with DVT had an elevated median first D-dimer (18.88 mcg\/mL [IQR 7.79, 20.00] versus 2.55 mcg\/mL [IQR 1.45, 6.28], p=0.002, reference range <0.5 mcg\/mL), average in-hospital D-dimer (median 11.93 mcg\/mL [IQR 8.25, 16.97] versus 3.54 mcg\/mL [IQR 2.05, 8.53] , p<0.001) and median fibrinogen level (501.0 (IQR 440.0, 629.0) versus 654.5 (IQR 535.8, 780.0), p= 0.002, reference range 187-502 mg\/dL). There was a trend to significance for COVID-19 patients with DVT compared to without DVT in median D-dimer levels at the time of the duplex (13.61 mcg\/mL [IQR 4.04, 19.97] versus 3.58 mcg\/mL [IQR 2.51, 9.62], p=0.055) and median ferritin levels (1,679.0 ng\/mL [IQR 1,168.0, 2,577.0] versus 1,103.0 ng\/mL [IQR 703.5, 2,076.5], p=0.055, reference 25-270 ng\/mL). Twelve of the 18 patients with COVID who developed DVT did so despite chemical thromboprophylaxis, and two developed DVT in spite of therapeutic anticoagulation CONCLUSIONS: We found only a modestly increased risk of DVT in patients with COVID-19, likely underestimated due to limitations in duplex testing early in the epidemic. Elevated D-dimer and a less elevated fibrinogen are associated with DVT in patients with COVID-19 who appear to form thrombus despite conventional chemical thromboprophylaxis.

Thoracic ultrasound showed signs of bilateral interstitial pneumonia and the Sars-Cov-2 swab was positive. Antiretroviral therapy and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin treatment were initiated. Due to the progressive impairment of respiratory function, the patient was intubated after eight days from the admission. The day after he showed signs of bilateral acute limb ischemia. A duplex ultrasound demonstrated the complete thrombosis of the aortic graft without flow at the femoral level. An urgent angio-computed tomography (CT) scan for revascularization purpose was requested, but the patient died upon the arrival in radiological suite.

SETTING: Tertiary-care center in Indianapolis, IN, United States. PATIENTS: Patients hospitalized at international units Health Methodist Hospital with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 requiring intubation between March 23, 2020, and April 8, 2020, who underwent ultrasound evaluation for venous thrombosis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 45 patients were included. Nineteen of 45 patients (42.2%) were found to have deep venous thrombosis. Patients found to have deep venous thrombosis had no difference in time to intubation (p = 0.97) but underwent ultrasound earlier in their hospital course (p = 0.02). Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were similar between the groups on day of intubation and day of ultrasound (p = 0.44 and p = 0.07, respectively). d-dimers were markedly higher in patients with deep venous thrombosis, both for maximum value and value on day of ultrasound (p < 0.01 for both). Choice of prophylactic regimen was not related to presence of deep venous thrombosis (p = 0.35). Ultrasound evaluation is recommended if d-dimer is greater than 2,000 ng\/mL (sensitivity 95%, specificity 46%) and empiric anticoagulation considered if d-dimer is greater than 5,500 ng\/mL (sensitivity 53%, specificity 88%). CONCLUSIONS: Deep venous thrombosis is very common in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019.

Severe forms are associated with coagulation changes, mainly characterized by an increase in D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, with a higher risk of thrombosis, particularly pulmonary embolism. The impact of obesity in severe COVID-19 has also been highlighted. In this context, standard doses of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) may be inadequate in ICU patients, with obesity, major inflammation, and hypercoagulability. We therefore urgently developed proposals on the prevention of thromboembolism and monitoring of hemostasis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Four levels of thromboembolic risk were defined according to the severity of COVID-19 reflected by oxygen requirement and treatment, the body mass index, and other risk factors. Monitoring of hemostasis (including fibrinogen and D-dimer levels) every 48 h is proposed. Standard doses of LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin 4000 IU\/24 h SC) are proposed in case of intermediate thrombotic risk (BMI < 30 kg\/m(2), no other risk factors and no ARDS). In all obese patients (high thrombotic risk), adjusted prophylaxis with intermediate doses of LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin 4000 IU\/12 h SC or 6000 IU\/12 h SC if weight > 120 kg), or unfractionated heparin (UFH) if renal insufficiency (200 IU\/kg\/24 h, IV), is proposed. The thrombotic risk was defined as very high in obese patients with ARDS and added risk factors for thromboembolism, and also in case of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), unexplained catheter thrombosis, dialysis filter thrombosis, or marked inflammatory syndrome and\/or hypercoagulability (e.g., fibrinogen > 8 g\/l and\/or D-dimers > 3 \u03bcg\/ml). In ICU patients, it is sometimes difficult to confirm a diagnosis of thrombosis, and curative anticoagulant treatment may also be discussed on a probabilistic basis. In all these situations, therapeutic doses of LMWH, or UFH in case of renal insufficiency with monitoring of anti-Xa activity, are proposed. In conclusion, intensification of heparin treatment should be considered in the context of COVID-19 on the basis of clinical and biological criteria of severity, especially in severely ill ventilated patients, for whom the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism cannot be easily confirmed.","publish_time":1592524800000,"author_summary":" Susen, Sophie; Tacquard, Charles Ambroise;<br>Godon, Alexandre; Mansour, Alexandre; Garrigue,<br>Delphine; Nguyen, Philippe; Godier, Anne; Testa,<br>Sophie; Levy, Jerrold H.; Albaladejo, Pierre; Gruel,<br>Yves","abstract_summary":" COVID-19 is an infection induced by the<br>SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and severe forms can lead to acute<br>respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive<br>care unit (ICU) management.

Although it was initially thought that insidious venous thromboembolic events (VTE) were mainly confined to ventilated patients [3], we now understand thrombotic risk to be a wider problem in COVID-19. An overexuberant host inflammatory response, in selected patients with severe COVID-19, may contribute to the high mortality. We recently recommended screening for virally-driven hyperinflammation in COVID-19 and proposed that immunomodulation in this subgroup of patients, may improve outcomes [4]. There are several ongoing, randomised controlled trials evaluating the therapeutic potential of Janus Kinase inhibitors (JAKi) in severe COVID-19 (table 1). JAKi have a purported advantage over other immunomodulatory strategies in COVID-19, as they may exert dual anti-inflammatory (blockade of multiple, pro-inflammatory cytokines simultaneously) and anti-viral effects (impeding cellular viral endocytosis [5, 6]) and have convenient oral administration, with relatively short half-lives. JAKi may interrupt the signalling of several pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of hyperinflammation, including interleukin (IL)-6, which has been the focus of several clinical trials in COVID-19. JAKi may also inhibit the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the AT2 alveolar epithelial cells; baricitinib (a JAK1\/2 inhibitor), is a numb-associated kinase (NAK) inhibitor, with a particularly high affinity for AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1), a pivotal regulator of clathrin-mediated viral endocytosis [5].

Our purpose was to assess thrombotic risk in severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: All patients referred to 4 intensive care units (ICUs) from two centers of a French tertiary hospital for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 between March 3rd and 31st 2020 were included. Medical history, symptoms, biological data and imaging were prospectively collected. Propensity score matching was performed to analyze the occurrence of thromboembolic events between non-COVID-19 ARDS and COVID-19 ARDS patients. RESULTS: 150 COVID-19 patients were included (122 men, median age 63 [53; 71] years, SAPSII 49 [37; 64] points). Sixty-four clinically relevant thrombotic complications were diagnosed in 150 patients, mainly pulmonary embolisms (16.7%). 28\/29 patients (96.6%) receiving continuous renal replacement therapy experienced circuit clotting. Three thrombotic occlusions (in 2 patients) of centrifugal pump occurred in 12 patients (8%) supported by ECMO. Most patients (> 95%) had elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen. No patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. Von Willebrand (vWF) activity, vWF antigen and FVIII were considerably increased, and 50\/57 tested patients (87.7%) had positive lupus anticoagulant. Comparison with non-COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 145) confirmed that COVID-19 ARDS patients (n = 77) developed significantly more thrombotic complications, mainly pulmonary embolisms (11.7 vs. 2.1%, p < 0.008). Coagulation parameters significantly differed between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Despite anticoagulation, a high number of patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 developed life-threatening thrombotic complications. Higher anticoagulation targets than in usual critically ill patients should therefore probably be suggested.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of VTE in patients with severe NCP. METHODS: In this study, 81 severe NCP patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Union Hospital (Wuhan, China) were enrolled. The results of conventional coagulation parameters and lower limb vein ultrasonography of these patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The incidence of VTE in these patients was 25% (20\/81), of which 8 patients with VTE events died.

Viral infections are known to be associated with coagulation impairment thus thrombosis, hemorrhage, or both, may occur. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of coagulation disorders during viral infection is essential for the development of therapeutic strategies. Coagulopathy in COVID-19 infection is emerging as a precipitant factor for severe respiratory complications and death. An increase in coagulation markers such as fibrinogen and D-Dimer has been found in severe COVID-19 cases.

A severe inflammatory response, originating in the alveoli, triggers a dysfunctional cascade of inflammatory thrombosis in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to a state of local coagulopathy. This is followed, in patients with more severe disease, by a generalized hypercoagulable state that results in macro- and microvascular thrombosis. Of concern, is the observation that anticoagulation may be inadequate in many circumstances, highlighting the need for alternative or additional therapies.

Reference lists were reviewed to identify additional relevant articles. DATA SYNTHESIS: Coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a strikingly high prevalence of coagulopathy and venous thromboembolism that may contribute to respiratory deterioration. Monitoring coagulation variables is important, as abnormal coagulation tests are related to adverse outcomes and may necessitate adjuvant antithrombotic interventions. In the initial phase of the infection, d-dimer and fibrinogen levels are increased, while activated partial prothrombin time, prothrombin time, and platelet counts are often relatively normal. Increased d-dimer levels three times the upper limit of normal may trigger screening for venous thromboembolism. In all hospitalized patients, thromboprophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin is currently recommended. The etiology of the procoagulant responses is complex and thought to be a result of specific interactions between host defense mechanisms and the coagulation system. Although the coagulopathy is reminiscent of disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathy, it has features that are markedly distinct from these entities. CONCLUSIONS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\/coronavirus disease 2019 frequently induces hypercoagulability with both microangiopathy and local thrombus formation, and a systemic coagulation defect that leads to large vessel thrombosis and major thromboembolic complications, including pulmonary embolism in critically ill hospitalized patients. d-dimers and fibrinogen levels should be monitored, and all hospitalized patients should undergo thromboembolism prophylaxis with an increase in therapeutic anticoagulation in certain clinical situations.","publish_time":1590451200000,"author_summary":" Iba, Toshiaki; Levy, Jerrold H.; Levi, Marcel;<br>Connors, Jean Marie; Thachil, Jecko","abstract_summary":" Recent studies have reported a high prevalence<br>of thrombotic events in coronavirus disease<br>2019.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether extended-duration rivaroxaban reduces the risk of venous and arterial fatal and major thromboembolic events without significantly increasing major bleeding in acutely ill medical patients after discharge. METHODS: MARINER (A Study of Rivaroxaban [JNJ-39039039] on the Venous Thromboembolic Risk in Post-Hospital Discharge Patients) studied acutely ill medical patients with additional risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Medically ill patients with a baseline creatinine clearance \u226550 ml\/min were randomized in a double-blind fashion to rivaroxaban 10 mg or placebo daily at hospital discharge for 45 days. Exploratory efficacy analyses were performed with the intent-to-treat population including all data through day 45. Time-to-event curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A blinded independent committee adjudicated all clinical events. RESULTS: In total, 4,909 patients were assigned to rivaroxaban and 4,913 patients to placebo. The mean age was 67.8 years, 55.5% were men, mean baseline creatinine clearance was 87.8 ml\/min, and mean duration of hospitalization was 6.7 days. The pre-specified composite efficacy endpoint (symptomatic VTE, myocardial infarction, nonhemorrhagic stroke, and cardiovascular death) occurred in 1.28% and 1.77% of patients in the rivaroxaban and placebo groups, respectively (hazard ratio: 0.72; 95% confidence interval: 0.52 to 1.00; p = 0.049), whereas major bleeding occurred in 0.27% and 0.18% of patients in the rivaroxaban and placebo groups, respectively (hazard ratio: 1.44; 95% confidence interval: 0.62 to 3.37; p = 0.398).

METHODS: In this single-centre cross-sectional study, hospitalised adult (\u226518 years) patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were identified in the medical intensive care unit (ICU) or a specialised non-ICU COVID-19 floor in our hospital. Asymptomatic, non-hospitalised controls were recruited as a comparator group for biomarkers that did not have a reference range. We assessed markers of endothelial cell and platelet activation, including von Willebrand Factor (VWF) antigen, soluble thrombomodulin, soluble P-selectin, and soluble CD40 ligand, as well as coagulation factors, endogenous anticoagulants, and fibrinolytic enzymes. We compared the level of each marker in ICU patients, non-ICU patients, and controls, where applicable. We assessed correlations between these laboratory results with clinical outcomes, including hospital discharge and mortality. Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis was used to further explore the association between biochemical markers and survival. FINDINGS: 68 patients with COVID-19 were included in the study from April 13 to April 24, 2020, including 48 ICU and 20 non-ICU patients, as well as 13 non-hospitalised, asymptomatic controls. Markers of endothelial cell and platelet activation were significantly elevated in ICU patients compared with non-ICU patients, including VWF antigen (mean 565% [SD 199] in ICU patients vs 278% [133] in non-ICU patients; p<0\u00b70001) and soluble P-selectin (15\u00b79 ng\/mL [4\u00b78] vs 11\u00b72 ng\/mL [3\u00b71]; p=0\u00b70014). VWF antigen concentrations were also elevated above the normal range in 16 (80%) of 20 non-ICU patients. We found mortality to be significantly correlated with VWF antigen (r = 0\u00b738; p=0\u00b70022) and soluble thrombomodulin (r = 0\u00b738; p=0\u00b70078) among all patients. In all patients, soluble thrombomodulin concentrations greater than 3\u00b726 ng\/mL were associated with lower rates of hospital discharge (22 [88%] of 25 patients with low concentrations vs 13 [52%] of 25 patients with high concentrations; p=0\u00b70050) and lower likelihood of survival on Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis (hazard ratio 5\u00b79, 95% CI 1\u00b79\u201318\u00b74; p=0\u00b70087). INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that endotheliopathy is present in COVID-19 and is likely to be associated with critical illness and death. Early identification of endotheliopathy and strategies to mitigate its progression might improve outcomes in COVID-19.
