{"cluster": 23, "subcluster": 148, "abstract_summ": " We assess the impact of COVID-19 response measures implemented in Germany and Switzerland on cumulative hospitalization and death rates . Our analysis exploits the fact that the epidemic was more advanced in some regions than in others when certain lockdown measures came into force . We find for both countries that a relatively later exposure to the measures entails higher hospitalization rates on region-specific days after outbreak ."}
