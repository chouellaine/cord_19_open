CR3022 targets a highly conserved epitope, distal from the receptor-binding site, that enables cross-reactive binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Structural modeling further demonstrates that the binding epitope can only be accessed by CR3022 when at least two RBD on the trimeric S protein are in the \u201cup\u201d conformation and slightly rotated.", "title_summ": "Structural basis of receptor recognition by SARS-CoV-2.A highly conserved cryptic epitope in the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoVComparative analysis of non structural protein 1 of SARS-COV2 with SARS-COV1 and MERS-COV: An in silico studyStructural and Functional Basis of SARS-CoV-2 Entry by Using Human ACE2Cell entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2A highly conserved cryptic epitope in the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoVA Cryptic Site of Vulnerability on the Receptor Binding Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein", "title_abstract_phrases": "First, SARS-CoV-2 RBD has higher hACE2 binding affinity than SARS-CoV RBD, supporting efficient cell entry.These findings shed light on the viral pathogenesis and provide important structural information regarding development of therapeutic countermeasures against the emerging virus.ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY Structural study of a cross-reactive SARS antibody reveals a conserved epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain.Highlights Structural elucidation at molecular level of nsp1 of SARS-COV1, SARS-COV2, and MERS-COV Identifications of epitopes by immunoinformatics approach SARS-COV2 nsp1 cover a large conformational space due to greater flexibility Molecular docking between SARS-COV2 nsp1 and POLA1 to identify important residues Structural insights of nsp1 could be used in drug design process against COVID-19 Graphical abstractStructural and Functional Basis of SARS-CoV-2 Entry by Using Human ACE2The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in China has caused significant public health concerns.Second, paradoxically, the hACE2 binding affinity of the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike is comparable to or lower than that of SARS-CoV spike, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 RBD, albeit more potent, is less exposed than SARS-CoV RBD."}
