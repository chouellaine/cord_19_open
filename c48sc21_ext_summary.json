P = 0.018).In order to reduce the overdiagnosis risk of acute myocardial injury in critically ill patients, detection of increased troponin levels should always be contextualized into a multi-parametric evaluation.CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized patients with concomitant cardiac disease and COVID-19 have an extremely poor prognosis compared with subjects without a history of cardiac disease, with higher mortality, thrombo-embolic events, and septic shock rates.", "title_summ": "Acute cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19Myocardial injury is associated with in-hospital mortality of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: A single center retrospective cohort studyCardiac function in relation to myocardial injury in hospitalised patients with COVID-19In-hospital cardiac arrest outcomes among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, ChinaAcute limb ischemia in patients with COVID-19 pneumoniaPrevalence and Impact of Myocardial Injury in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19 InfectionMyocardial injury characterized by elevated cardiac troponin and in\u2010hospital mortality of COVID\u201019: an insight from a meta\u2010analysisStatinImplications of the complex biology and micro-environment of cardiac sarcomeres in the use of high affinity troponin antibodies as serum biomarkers for cardiac disordersCardiac injury is associated with mortality and critically ill pneumonia in COVID-19: A meta-analysisImpaired cardiac function is associated with mortality in patients with acute COVID-19 infectionCharacteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and cardiac disease in Northern ItalyCharacteristics and Outcomes in Patients Presenting with COVID-19 and ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial InfarctionPrevalence and Impact of Myocardial Injury in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19 InfectionPrognostic role of serum high mobility group box 1 concentration in cardiac surgeryInitially elevated arterial lactate as an independent predictor of poor outcomes in severe acute pancreatitisAcute myocardial injury is common in patients with covid-19 and impairs their prognosis.[New insights into the seriousness of acute myocardial injury during COVID-19].Death, discharge and arrhythmias among patients with COVID-19 and cardiac injury.[Analysis of myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19 and association between concomitant cardiovascular diseases and severity of COVID-19].[Impact of complicated myocardial injury on the clinical outcome of severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients].[Prognostic value of myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19].Risk factors for myocardial injury and death in patients with COVID-19: insights from a cohort study with chest computed tomography.Prognostic significance of cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients with and without coronary artery disease.Myocardial injury determination improves risk stratification and predicts mortality in COVID-19 patients.", "title_abstract_phrases": "CONCLUSION Cardiac injury on admission is associated with worse clinical outcome and higher mortality risk in COVID-19 patients including patients free of previous CAD diagnosis.Death, discharge and arrhythmias among patients with COVID-19 and cardiac injury.Conclusion Cardiac injury is associated with mortality, need for ICU care, and severity of disease in patients with COVID-19.Impaired cardiac function is associated with mortality in patients with acute COVID-19 infectionBACKGROUND: COVID-19 infection may cause severe respiratory distress and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.The study also provides novel insights into the risk factors for myocardial injury, showing that an increased pulmonary artery diameter, assessed by chest computed tomography, is an independent predictor of myocardial injury as well as of mortality, suggesting that pulmonary circulation dysfunction is a pivotal pathological event with cardiac implications in COVID-19.Prognostic significance of cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients with and without coronary artery disease.[Conclusions] Cardiac injury defined by hs-cTnI elevation and elevated d-dimer on admission were risk factors for in-hospital death, while higher SpO2 could be seen as a protective factor, which could help clinicians to identify patients with adverse outcome at the early stage of COVID-19.Cardiac function in relation to myocardial injury in hospitalised patients with COVID-19BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported on myocardial injury in patients with coronavirus infectious disease 19 (COVID-19) defined as elevated cardiac biomarkers."}
