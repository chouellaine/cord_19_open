{"cluster": 60, "subcluster": 24, "abstract_summ": " Certain stem-loops impede ribosome movement along mRNA and stimulate programmed ribosomes frameshifting via mechanisms that are not well understood . We propose that a similar strategy may be utilized by other classes of nucleic acid polymerases to ensure templating nucleotide positioning for efficient catalysis ."}
