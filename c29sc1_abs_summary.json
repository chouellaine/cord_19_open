{"cluster": 29, "subcluster": 1, "abstract_summ": " Lung injury and fibrosis represent the most significant outcomes of severe and acute lung disorders, including COVID-19 . In this study, we report the generation of clinical-grade human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)-derived immunity- and matrix-regulatory cells (IMRCs) produced under good manufacturing practice (GMP) requirements . IMRCs possess a unique gene expression profile distinct from umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells, such as higher levels of proliferative, immunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic genes . In light of public health crises involving pneumonia, acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome ."}
