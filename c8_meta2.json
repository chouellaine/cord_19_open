Then, differences were explored in 24 in-depth interviews in the public and private sectors, including financial industry, manufacturing, and oil and gas. Results indicate that RPA is used to either layoff or not reemploy knowledge workers, but also to empower knowledge workers with more interesting tasks. Private sector was different from public sector in that private, financial companies have experienced the strongest reduction in the need for employment. RPA often lead to layoffs indirectly, and to reduced need for consultants, especially in financial companies. In contrast, public companies use RPA more for innovations in their service production from increased quality in data registration, handling of invoices, and data migration between systems. We conclude that RPA is maturing as a management tool motivated by cost reductions from reduced employment, and we suggest propositions for further research.","publish_time":1583452800000,"author_summary":" Eikebrokk, Tom Roar; Olsen, Dag H\u00e5kon","abstract_summary":" This paper explores an overly optimistic and<br>tenacious claim in the literature that robotic process<br>automation (RPA) will only free knowledge workers from<br>mundane tasks and introduce more interesting work.

This study intends to provide modeling bases for the dynamics of preferences and behaviors due to mutual influence among agents in groups, particularly for the study of fertility intention and behavior in families, and more broadly, the forecast of population growth and effects of fertility policy.

We prove that the counting rule, which chooses the decision procedures with greatest supports, is the unique aggregation rule that satisfies anonymity (A), neutrality (N), strict monotonicity (SM), and partition consistency (PC), where PC is proposed based on the idea that representations of equivalent criteria in different ways should not affect the results. Two distinct standpoints for PCBPC are highlighted: one is to regard criteria as atomic, i.e., inseparable, objects and the other as composite, i.e., separable, objects.

Analogical inference relies on the fact that if a proportion [Formula: see text] is valid, one of the four components of the proportion can be computed from the three others.

When such information is unavailable, as is commonly the case when sources are unknown a priori (e.g., in crowdsourcing), prior work has proposed the extraction of valuable insight (captured within FMs) directly from the evidence or input data by analyzing properties such as specificity or agreement amongst sources. Here, existing agreement-based FMs use established measures of similarity such as Jaccard and Dice to estimate the source agreement. Recently, a new similarity measure based on bidirectional subsethood was put forward to compare evidence, minimizing limitations such as aliasing (where different inputs result in the same similarity output) present in traditional similarity measures. In this paper, we build on this new similarity measure to develop a new instance of the agreement-based FM for interval-valued data. The proposed FM is purposely designed to support aggregation, and unlike previous agreement FMs, it degrades gracefully to an average operator for cases where no overlap between sources exists. We validate that it respects all requirements of a FM and explore its impact when used in conjunction with the Choquet FI for data fusion as part of both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing empirically that it generates robust and qualitatively superior outputs for the cases considered.","publish_time":1589500800000,"author_summary":" Kabir, Shaily; Wagner, Christian","abstract_summary":" Recent advances in the literature have<br>leveraged the fuzzy integral (FI), a powerful<br>multi-source aggregation operator, where a fuzzy measure<br>(FM) is used to capture the worth of all combinations<br>of subsets of sources.

In this work, we introduce SK-MOEFS (acronym of SciKit-Multi Objective Evolutionary Fuzzy System), a new Python library that allows the user to easily and quickly design FRBSs, employing Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms. Indeed, a set of FRBSs, characterized by different trade-offs between their accuracy and their explainability, can be generated by SK-MOEFS. The user, then, will be able to select the most suitable model for his\/her specific application.","publish_time":1589587200000,"author_summary":" Gallo, Gionatan; Ferrari, Vincenzo;<br>Marcelloni, Francesco; Ducange, Pietro","abstract_summary":" Recently, the explainability of Artificial<br>Intelligence (AI) models and algorithms is becoming an<br>important requirement in real-world applications.<br>Indeed, although AI allows us to address and solve very<br>difficult and complicated problems, AI-based tools act<br>as a black box and, usually, do not explain<br>how\/why\/when a specific decision has been taken.

Continuous optimization is used to generate a schedule from the assignments found in the discrete optimization models at each time point by extremizing the Hamiltonian function at this time point subject to scheduling objective(s). In addition, the execution of the operations in time can be accurately modeled in continuous time as a continuous state variable; the machine availability and capacity disturbances at the machines are also considered.

Cuckoo-Firefly-GR not only employs the random walk in CS, but also uses mechanisms in FA to generate and select fitter individuals. The content- and behavior-based features of emails used in the existing works, along with Doc2Vec features of the email body are employed to extract the syntactic and semantic information in the emails. By establishing an optimal balance between intensification and diversification, and reaching global optimization using two metaheuristics, we argue that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the performance of UBE detection, by selecting the most discriminative feature subspace. This study presents significant observations from the extensive evaluations on UBE corpora of 3, 844 emails, that underline the efficiency and superiority of our proposed Cuckoo-Firefly-GR over the base optimizations (Cuckoo-GR and Firefly-GR), dense autoencoders, recurrent neural autoencoders, and several state-of-the-art methods.

Aiming to address these issues, we therefore seek to propose a hybrid strategy to improve the BFO algorithm in each stage of the bacteria\u2019s\u2019 foraging behavior. Firstly, a non-linear descending strategy of step size is adopted in the process of flipping, where a larger step size is given to the particle at the very beginning of the iteration, promoting the rapid convergence of the algorithm while later on a smaller step size is given, helping enhance the particles\u2019 global search ability.

In this way, the particles will adjust the step size according to the degree of crowding to achieve efficient swimming.

In this study, a Performance Class-Based learning PSO (PCB-PSO) algorithm is proposed, that not only increases and maintains swarm diversity but also improves exploration and exploitation while speeding up convergence simultaneously. In the PCB-PSO algorithm, each particle belongs to a class based on its fitness value and particles might change classes at evolutionary stages or search step based on their updated position. The particles are divided into an upper, middle and lower. In the upper class are particles with top fitness values, the middle are those with average while particles in the bottom class are the worst performing in the swarm. The number of particles in each group is predetermined. Each class has a unique learning strategy designed specifically for a given task. The upper class is designed to converge towards the best solution found, Middle class particles exploit the search space while lower class particles explore. The algorithm\u2019s strength is its flexibility and robustness as the population of each class allows us to prioritize a desired swarm behavior.

We pose the problem as a game between the sender and receiver, where the receiver tries to maximize the number of sequences that can be recovered perfectly and the sender maximizes its utility. We show that, in spite of the sender being strategic and the presence of noise in the channel, there is a strategy for the receiver by which it can perfectly recover an \\textit{exponentially} large number of sequences. Our analysis leads to the notion of the \\textit{information extraction capacity} of the sender which quantifies the growth rate of the number of recovered sequences with blocklength, in the presence of a noiseless channel. We identify cases where this capacity is equal to its theoretical maximum, and also when it is strictly less than maximum. In the latter case, we show that the capacity is sandwiched between the independence number and the Shannon capacity of a suitably defined graph. These results lead to an exact characterization of the information extraction capacity in large number of cases. We show that in the presence of a noisy channel, the rate of information extraction achieved by the receiver is the minimum of the zero-error capacity of the channel and the information extraction capacity of the sender.

For a small number of issues m, the social cost can be made even closer to optimal by delegation procedures that weigh committee members according to their number of followers.

In this study we address a trilevel optimization problem for the protection of depots of utmost importance in a routing network against an intelligent adversary. We formulate the problem as a defender-attacker-defender game and refer to it as the trilevel r-interdiction selective multi-depot vehicle routing problem (3LRI-SMDVRP). The defender is the decision maker in the upper level problem (ULP) who picks u depots to protect among m existing ones. In the middle level problem (MLP), the attacker destroys r depots among the (m\u2013u) unprotected ones to bring about the biggest disruption. Finally, in the lower level problem (LLP), the decision maker is again the defender who optimizes the vehicle routes and thereby selects which customers to visit and serve in the wake of the attack. All three levels have an identical objective function which is comprised of three components. (i) Operating or acquisition cost of the vehicles. (ii) Traveling cost incurred by the vehicles. (iii) Outsourcing cost due to unvisited customers. The defender aspires to minimize this objective function while the attacker tries to maximize it. As a solution approach to this trilevel discrete optimization problem, we resort to a smart exhaustive enumeration in the ULP and MLP.

In this paper, we propose a multi-criterion decision-making method based on the Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory and generalized Z-numbers. To do so, inspired by the concept of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set, we extend the Z-number to a generalized form which is more in line with human expression habits. Afterwards, we make a bridge between the knowledge of Z-numbers and the DS evidence theory to integrate Z-valuations. The identification framework in the DS theory is used to describe the generalized Z-numbers to avoid ambiguity. Then, the knowledge of Z-numbers is used to derive the basic probability assignment of evidence and the synthetic rules in the DS theory are used to integrate evaluations. An illustrative example of medicine selection for the patients with mild symptoms of the COVID-19 is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.","publish_time":1588291200000,"author_summary":" Ren, Zongyuan; Liao, Huchang; Liu, Yuxi","abstract_summary":" Fuzzy set theory and a series of theories<br>derived from it have been widely used to deal with<br>uncertain phenomena in multi-criterion<br>decision-making problems.
