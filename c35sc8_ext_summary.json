Upon infection, SARS-CoV-2 induced hundreds of up-regulated host genes hallmarked by a significant cytokine production followed by virus-specific host antiviral responses.Finally, we compared transcriptomic SARS-CoV-2 response to H1N1 response in NHBE cells to elucidate the virus specificity of the response and virus specific extracellular proteins expressed by NHBE cells.", "title_summ": "Interplay of host regulatory network on SARS-CoV-2 binding and replication machineryComparative transcriptome analysis reveals the intensive early-stage responses of host cells to SARS-CoV-2 infectionBulk and single-cell gene expression profiling of SARS-CoV-2 infected human cell lines identifies molecular targets for therapeutic interventionThe transcriptomic profiling of COVID-19 compared to SARS, MERS, Ebola, and H1N1Growth factor receptor signaling inhibition prevents SARS-CoV-2 replicationCOVID-19: Viral-host interactome analyzed by network based-approach model to study pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infectionSARS-CoV-2 proteins exploit host\u2019s genetic and epigenetic mediators for the annexation of key host signaling pathways that confers its immune evasion and disease pathophysiologyHidden in plain sight: The effects of BCG vaccination in COVID-19 pandemicVirus-host interactome and proteomic survey of PMBCs from COVID-19 patients reveal potential virulence factors influencing SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesisEpigenetic regulator miRNA pattern differences among SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 world-wide isolates delineated the mystery behind the epic pathogenicity and distinct clinical characteristics of pandemic COVID-19Integrative Network Biology Framework Elucidates Molecular Mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 PathogenesisRe-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected host cell proteomics time-course data by impact pathway analysis and network analysis.A potential link with inflammatory responseFunctional characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests a complex inflammatory response and metabolic alterationsGenome-wide CRISPR screen reveals host genes that regulate SARS-CoV-2 infectionTranscriptional response of signalling pathways to SARS-CoV-2 infection in normal human bronchial epithelial cellsMulti-level proteomics reveals host-perturbation strategies of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoVTranscriptional landscape of SARS-CoV-2 infection dismantles pathogenic pathways activated by the virus, proposes unique sex-specific differences and predicts tailored therapeutic strategiesIntegration of transcriptomic profile of SARS-CoV-2 infected normal human bronchial epi-thelial cells with metabolic and protein-protein interaction networksA data-driven hypothesis on the epigenetic dysregulation of host metabolism by SARS coronaviral infection: potential implications for the SARS-CoV-2 modus operandiCOVID-19: viral\u2013host interactome analyzed by network based-approach model to study pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infectionTargeting hub genes and pathways of innate immune response in COVID-19: A network biology perspectiveRe-analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected host cell proteomics time-course data by impact pathway analysis and network analysis: a potential link with inflammatory response.The Prediction of miRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 Genomes: hsa-miR Databases Identify 7 Key miRs Linked to Host Responses and Virus Pathogenicity-Related KEGG Pathways Significant for Comorbidities.Proteome-wide Data Analysis Reveals Tissue-specific Network Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Infection.", "title_abstract_phrases": "Re-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected host cell proteomics time-course data by impact pathway analysis and network analysis.Here we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen with SARS-CoV-2 and identified known SARS-CoV-2 host factors including the receptor ACE2 and protease Cathepsin L. We additionally discovered novel pro-viral genes and pathways including the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and key components of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway.This study describes host cell signaling events upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and reveals GFR signaling as central pathway essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication.Integrating the experimentally validated host interactome proteins and differentially expressed host genes due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we have taken a blend of computational and knowledgebase approach to delineate the interplay between host and SARS-CoV-2 in various signaling pathways.Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 integrates its proteins in different immune signaling pathway and other cellular signaling pathways for developing efficient immune evasion mechanisms, while leading the host to more complicated disease condition."}
