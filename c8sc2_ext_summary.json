In order to address these applications, we consider continuous-time online learning problem with fairness considerations, and present a novel framework based on continuous-time utility maximization.To deal with Lipschitz continuous and strongly convex cost functions, a distributed online convex optimization algorithm that achieves sublinear individual regret for every node is developed.In the absence of any statistical knowledge, we propose a novel online learning algorithm based on dual ascent optimization for time averages, and prove that it achieves $\\tilde{O}(B^{-1/2})$ regret bound.", "title_summ": "On the Complexity of Stackelberg Matroid Pricing ProblemsNew Bounds for Maximizing Revenue in Online Dial-a-RideDynamic Pricing Using Thompson Sampling with Fuzzy EventsLearning while shopping: an experimental investigation into the effect of learning on consumer searchA Preliminary Study on Score-Based Hyper-heuristics for Solving the Bin Packing ProblemPush-Sum Distributed Online Optimization With Bandit Feedback.Online Learning and Optimization for Revenue Management Problems with Add-on DiscountsGroup-Fair Online Allocation in Continuous TimeUnbiased Lift-based Bidding System", "title_abstract_phrases": "In this article, we concentrate on distributed online convex optimization problems over multiagent systems, where the communication between nodes is represented by a class of directed graphs that are time varying and uniformly strongly connected.Group-Fair Online Allocation in Continuous TimeThe theory of discrete-time online learning has been successfully applied in many problems that involve sequential decision-making under uncertainty.Furthermore, as a consequence of certain ethical and economic concerns, the controller may impose deadlines on the completion of each task, and require fairness across different groups in the allocation of total time budget $B$.
