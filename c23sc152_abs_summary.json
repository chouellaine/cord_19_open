{"cluster": 23, "subcluster": 152, "abstract_summ": " Estimating the key epidemiological features of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic proves to be challenging, given incompleteness and delays in early data reporting . We developed an alternative geo-stratified debiasing estimation framework by incorporating human mobility with case reporting data in three stratified zones . We estimated the latent infection ratio to be around 0.12% (18,556 people) and the basic reproduction number to be 3.24 in Wuhan before January 23, 2020 ."}
