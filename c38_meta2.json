Hepatic I\/R injury also causes remote damage to other organs including the renal and pulmonary systems. Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a selective \u03b12-adrenoceptor agonist which is used as an adjuvant to general anesthesia, has been shown in preclinical studies to provide organ protection by ameliorating the effects of I\/R injury in a range of tissues (including the liver). However, prospective clinical evidence of any potential benefits in improving outcomes in liver transplantation is lacking. This study aimed to verify the hypothesis that the application of dexmedetomidine during the perioperative period of liver transplantation can reduce the incidence of EAD and primary graft non-function (PNF). At the same time, the effects of dexmedetomidine application on perioperative renal function and lung function were studied. METHODS: This is a prospective, single-center, randomized, parallel-group study. Two hundred participants (18\u201365 years) scheduled to undergo liver transplantation under general anesthesia will be included in this study. For participants in the treatment group, a loading dose of DEX will be given after induction of anesthesia (1 \u03bcg\/kg over 10 min) followed by a continuous infusion (0.5 \u03bcg\/kg \/h) until the end of surgery. For participants in the placebo group, an equal volume loading dose of 0.9% saline will be given after the induction of anesthesia followed by an equal volume continuous infusion until the end of surgery. All other supplements, e.g., opioids, sedatives, and muscle relaxant, will be identical in both arms and administered according to routine clinical practice. DISCUSSION: The present trial will examine whether DEX confers organoprotective effects in the liver, in terms of reducing the incidence of EAD and PNF in orthotopic liver transplantation recipients.

Kidney transplantation (KT) has been tremendously affected due to limited personal protective equipment (PPE) and intensive care unit (ICU) capacities. To provide valid information on risk factors for ICU admission in a high-risk cohort of old kidney recipients from old donors in the Eurotransplant Senior Program (ESP), we retrospectively conducted a bi-centric analysis. Overall, 17 (16.2%) patients out of 105 KTs were admitted to the ICU. They had a lower BMI, and both coronary artery disease (CAD) and hypertensive nephropathy were more frequent. A risk model combining BMI, CAD and hypertensive nephropathy gained a sensitivity of 94.1% and a negative predictive value of 97.8%, rendering it a valuable search test, but with low specificity (51.1%).

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary measure was vital status at end of study follow-up. Secondary measures included patient characteristics, laboratory analyses, changes to immunosuppression, and treatment administered for COVID-19. Results Twenty-eight patients with HT received a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The median age was 64.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 53.5-70.5) years, 22 (79%) were men, and the median time from HT was 8.6 (IQR, 4.2-14.5) years. Comorbid conditions included hypertension in 20 patients (71%), diabetes in 17 patients (61%), and cardiac allograft vasculopathy in 16 patients (57%).

Lung transplantation (LT) as the sole therapy for end-stage pulmonary fibrosis related to acute respiratory distress syndrome has been considered as the ultimate rescue therapy for these patients. METHODS From February 10 to March 10, 2020, three male patients were urgently assessed and listed for transplantation. After conducting a full ethical review and after obtaining assent from the family of the patients, we performed three LT procedures for COVID-19 patients with illness durations of >1 month and extremely high sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores. RESULTS Two of the three recipients survived post-LT and started participating in a rehabilitation program. Pearls of the LT team collaboration and perioperative logistics were summarized and continually improved. The pathological results of the explanted lungs were concordant with the critical clinical manifestation, and provided insight towards better understanding of the disease.

Eighty-eight centers reported COVID-19 infection in 57 LT candidates and in 272 LT recipients. Overall crude incidence of COVID-19 among LT candidates and recipients was estimated 1.05 % (range 0.5%-20% and 0.34% (range 0.1%-4.8%), respectively and it was significantly higher among candidates (p<0.001). Crude rate of death was 18% (10\/57) among candidates and 15% (36\/244) among recipients. This first large-scale European snapshot study clearly shows that both LT candidates and recipients are at a high risk for COVID-19. These results plead for an early and pro-active screening of COVID-19 symptoms in these populations.","publish_time":1593561600000,"author_summary":" Polak, Wojciech G; Fondevila, Constantino;<br>Karam, Vincent; Adam, Rene; Baumann, Ulrich;<br>Germani, Giacomo; Nadalin, Silvio; Taimr, Pavel; Toso,<br>Christian; Troisi, Roberto I; Zieniewicz, Krzysztof;<br>Belli, Luca S; Duvoux, Christophe","abstract_summary":" There are scarce data on the impact of COVID-19<br>pandemic on liver transplantation (LT) in Europe.

Pediatric patients admitted for renal transplantation from donation after brain death donors were randomized into a treatment arm receiving aminophylline and a placebo arm receiving normal saline infusions. Primary outcome was estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 5 days post-transplant. Secondary outcomes were rates of DGF\/SGF and urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels. RESULTS Twenty-three patients were randomized to aminophylline and 27 to placebo.

RESULTS KTRs should be considered immunocompromised hosts: potential risk for infection, non-negligible comorbidity, and exposure to long-term immunosuppression. Only single center small retrospective experiences are still available regarding KTRs with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 symptoms in KTRs are similar to that observed for the general population, being fever and cough the most frequently observed. Mild-to-moderate symptomatic KTRs can be managed in an outpatient setting, while patients exhibiting severe symptoms must be addmited to hospital. More rapid clinical progression, and higher complication and death rates have been observed for hospitalized KTRs, requiring hemodyalisis or ventilatory support. Lymphopenia, elevated serum markers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, IL-6, D-dimer), and chest-X-ray findings consistent with pneumonia are linked to worse prognosis. A number of antiviral therapies have been used. However, it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions regarding their efficacy at this point.

Preliminary data reported a high prevalence of CoV-2 infection and mortality due to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related to CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in kidney transplanted patients (KTRs). Nevertheless, the outcomes and the best treatments for SARS-CoV-2 affected KTRs remain unclear. METHODS In this report we describe the clinical data, the treatments and the outcomes of 5 KTRs with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to our hospital in Ancona, Marche region, Italy, from March, 17 to present. Due to the severity of SARS-CoV-2, immunosuppression with calcineurin inhibitors, antimetabolites and mTOR-inhibitors were stopped at the admission. All KTRs were treated with low-dose steroids. 4\/5 KTRs were treated with hydroxychloroquine. All KTRs received tocilizumab up to one dose. RESULTS Overall, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in KTRs in the Marche region was 0.85%. 3\/5 were admitted in ICU and intubated. One developed AKI with the need of CRRT with Cytosorb. At present 2 patients died, 2 patients were discharged and one is still inpatient in ICU. CONCLUSIONS The critical evaluation of all cases suggests that the timing of the administration of tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, could be associated with a better efficacy when administered in concomitance to the drop of the oxygen saturation. Thus, in SARS-CoV-2 affected KTRs a close biochemical and clinical monitoring should be set up to allow physicians to hit the virus in the right moment such as a sudden reduction of the oxygen saturation and\/or a significant increase of the laboratory values such as D-Dimer.","publish_time":1592870400000,"author_summary":" Maritati, Federica; Cerutti, Elisabetta;<br>Zuccatosta, Lina; Fiorentini, Alessandro; Finale,<br>Carolina; Ficosecco, Marta; Cristiano, Fabrizio;<br>Capestro, Alessandro; Balestra, Emilio; Taruscia,<br>Domenica; Vivarelli, Marco; Donati, Abele; Perna, Gian<br>Piero; Giacometti, Andrea; Tavio, Marcello; Onesta,<br>Maicol; Di Sante, Laura; Ranghino, Andrea","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND Infection related to<br>Coronavirus-19 (CoV-2) is pandemic affecting more than 4<br>million people in 187 countries worldwide.

It is therefore important to characterize the clinical course and outcome of Covid-19 in this vulnerable population and identify therapeutic strategies that are safe. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 54 adult kidney transplant patients diagnosed with Covid-19 and managed in New York State, the epicenter of Covid-19 pandemic. The patients were evaluated by video visits, phone interviews, or in the Emergency Room for respiratory illness symptoms consistent with Covid-19 from March 13, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Characteristics of the patients were stratified by hospitalization status and disease severity. Clinical course including alterations in immunosuppressive therapy were retrieved from their electronic medical records. Primary outcomes included recovery from Covid-19 symptoms, acute kidney injury, graft failure, and case fatality rate. Results: Of the 54 SARS-Cov-2 positive kidney transplant recipients, 39 with moderate to severe symptoms were admitted and 15 with mild symptoms were managed at home. Hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients were more likely to be male, of Hispanic ethnicity, and to have cardiovascular disease. At baseline, all but 2 were receiving tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and 32 were on a steroid free immunosuppression regimen. Tacrolimus dosage was reduced in 46% of hospitalized patients and maintained at baseline level in the non-hospitalized cohort. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) dosage was maintained at the baseline dosage in 11% of hospitalized patients and 64% of non-hospitalized patients, and was stopped in 61% hospitalized patients and 0% in the non-hospitalized cohort. Azithromycin or doxycycline were prescribed at a similar rate among hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients (38% vs. 40%). Hydroxychloroquine was prescribed in 79% of hospitalized patients and only one of 15 non-hospitalized patients. Acute kidney injury occurred in 51% of hospitalized patients. Patients with severe disease were more likely to have elevations in inflammatory biomarkers at presentation. At a median of 21 days follow up, 67% of patients have had their symptoms resolved or improved and 33% have persistent symptoms. Graft failure requiring hemodialysis occurred in 3 of 39 hospitalized patients (8%). Three of 39 (8%) hospitalized patients expired and none of the 15 non-hospitalized patients expired. Conclusions: Clinical presentation of Covid-19 in kidney transplant recipients was similar to what has been described in the general population. The case fatality rate in our entire cohort of 54 kidney transplant recipients was reassuringly low and patients with mild symptomology could be successfully managed at home. Data from the pilot study suggest that a strategy of systematic screening and triage to inpatient or outpatient care, close monitoring, and judicious use of immunosuppressive drugs rather than cessation is beneficial.","publish_time":1588636800000,"author_summary":" Lubetzky, M.; Aull, M.; Craig-Shapiro, R.;<br>Lee, J.; Sultan, S.; Marku-Podvorica, J.; Gingras,<br>L.; Kodiyanplakkal, R.

Among the 68 hospitalized patients, 12% required non\u2010rebreather and 35% required intubation. 91% received hydroxychloroquine, 66% azithromycin, 3% remdesivir, 21% tocilizumab, and 24% bolus steroids. Sixteen patients died (18% overall, 24% of hospitalized, 52% of ICU) and 37 (54%) were discharged. In this initial cohort, transplant recipients with COVID\u201019 appear to have more severe outcomes, although testing limitations likely led to undercounting of mild\/asymptomatic cases.

Whilst COVID-19 is predominantly a respiratory disease, in severe cases it can cause kidney and multi-organ failure. It is unknown if immunocompromised hosts are at higher risk of more severe systemic disease. Therefore, we report on seven cases of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients (median age 54 (range 45-69), three females, from a cohort of 2082 managed transplant follow-up patients) over a six-week period in three south London hospitals. Two of 32 patients presented within three months of transplantation. Overall, two were managed on an out-patient basis, but the remaining five required hospital admission, four in intensive care units. All patients displayed respiratory symptoms and fever. Other common clinical features included hypoxia, chest crepitation, lymphopenia and high C-reactive protein. Very high D dimer, ferritin and troponin levels occurred in severe cases and likely prognostic. Immunosuppression was modified in six of seven patients. Three patients with severe disease were diabetic. During a three week follow up one patient recovered, and one patient died. Thus, our findings suggest COVID-19 infection in kidney transplant patients may be severe, requiring intensive care admission. The symptoms are predominantly respiratory and associated with fever.

Although kidney transplant recipients are at increased risk of viral infections, the impact of their chronic immunosuppressed status on the risk of acquiring coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and disease severity is unknown. STUDY DESIGN: All cases of COVID-19 infection in our cohort of kidney transplant recipients were prospectively monitored. Clinical features, management and outcomes were recorded. A standard strategy of immunosuppression minimization was applied: discontinue the antimetabolite drug and reduce trough levels of calcineurin or mTOR inhibitors. Unless contraindicated, hydroxychloroquine was administered only to hospitalized patients. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 22 COVID-19 infections were diagnosed in our cohort of 1200 kidney transplant recipients. RESULTS: Most common initial symptoms included fever, cough, or dyspnea. Eighteen patients (82%) required hospitalization. Of those patients, 3 had everolimus-based immunosuppression. Chest computerized tomography (CT) at admission (performed in 15 patients) showed mild (n=3), moderate (n=8), extensive (n=1), severe (n=2), and critical (n=1) involvement. Immunosuppression reduction was initiated in all patients. Hydroxychloroquine was administered to 15 patients. Eleven patients required supplemental oxygen; 2 of them were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with mechanical ventilation.

The transplant community is faced with choosing a lesser of two evils: initiating immunosuppression and potentially accepting detrimental outcome when transplant recipients develop COVID-19 versus postponing transplantation and accepting associated waitlist mortality. Notably, prioritization of health care services for COVID-19 care raises concerns about allocation of resources to deliver care for transplant patients who might otherwise have excellent 1-year and 10-year survival rates. Children and young adults with end-stage organ disease in particular seem more disadvantaged by withholding transplantation because of capacity issues than from medical consequences of SARS-CoV-2. This report details the nationwide response of the Dutch transplant community to these issues and the immediate consequences for transplant activity. Worrisome, there was a significant decrease in organ donation numbers affecting all organ transplant services.

In addition, 10 of their family members diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the control group. Intervention Immunosuppressant reduction and low-dose methylprednisolone therapy. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis The clinical outcomes (the severity of pneumonia, recovery rate, time of virus shedding, and length of illness) were compared with the control group by statistical analysis. Results and limitations The clinical symptomatic, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in the renal transplant recipients were similar to those of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the general population. The severity of COVID-19 pneumonia was greater in the transplant recipients than in the control group (five severe\/three critical cases vs one severe case). Five patients developed transient renal allograft damage. After a longer time of virus shedding (28.4 \u00b1 9.3 vs 12.2 \u00b1 4.6 d in the control group) and a longer course of illness (35.3 \u00b1 8.3 vs 18.8 \u00b1 10.5 d in the control group), nine of the 10 transplant patients recovered successfully after treatment.

For patients with end-stage liver failure, liver transplantation is the only option. However, the strain on intensive care facilities caused by the pandemic is a major concern. There is an urgent need for ethical frameworks to balance the need for liver transplantation against the availability of national resources. METHODS: We performed an international multi-center study of transplant centers to understand the evolution of policies for transplant prioritization in response to the pandemic in March 2020. To describe the ethical tension arising in this setting, we propose a novel ethical framework, the Quadripartite Equipoise (QE) score, that is applicable to liver transplantation in the context of limited national resources. RESULTS: Seventeen large- and medium- sized liver transplant centers from twelve countries across four continents participated. Ten centers opted to limit transplant activity in response to the pandemic, favoring a \u201csickest-first\u201d approach. Conversely, some larger centers opted to continue routine transplant activity in order to balance waiting list mortality. To model these and other ethical tensions, we computed a QE score using 4 factors - Recipient Outcome, Donor\/Graft Safety, Waiting List Mortality and Healthcare Resources for seven countries. The fluctuation of the QE score over time accurately reflects the dynamic changes in the ethical tensions surrounding transplant activity in a pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This four-dimensional model of Quadripartite Equipoise addresses the ethical tensions in the current pandemic. It serves as a universally applicable framework to guide regulation of transplant activity in response to the increasing burden on healthcare systems to allow greater global solidarity and transparency in these austere times.","publish_time":1590192000000,"author_summary":" Chew, Claire Alexandra; Iyer, Shridhar<br>Ganpathi; Chieh Kow, Alfred Wei; Madhavan,<br>Krishnakumar; Teng Wong, Andrea Sze; Halazun, Karim J.;<br>Battula, Narendra; Scalera, Irene; Angelico, Roberta;<br>Farid, Sharid; Buchholz, Bettina M.; Rotellar,<br>Fernando; Chi-Yan Chan, Albert; Kim, Jong Man; Wang,<br>Chih-Chi; Pitchaimuthu, Maheswaran; Reddy, Mettu<br>Srinivas; Soin, Arvinder Singh; Derosas, Carlos;<br>Imventarza, Oscar; Isaac, John; Muiesan, Paolo; Mirza,<br>Darius F.; Bonney, Glenn Kunnath","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: The outbreak of Covid-19 has<br>vastly increased the operational burden on<br>healthcare systems worldwide.

Herein, we demonstrated two distinct cases with different clinical progress. The first case was a 36\u2010year\u2010old man who underwent KT 3 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID\u201019 expressing relevant symptoms. Following administration of lopinavir\/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine with reduced immunosuppressant, he recovered from COVID\u201019. However, the unexpected fluctuations in tacrolimus trough levels needed to be managed because of drug\u2010to\u2010drug interaction. The second case was developed in a 56\u2010year\u2010old man without any symptoms. He received a second KT from an ABO\u2010incompatible donor 8 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID\u201019 by screening due to exposure history. During the hospitalization period, the chest infiltrative lesion showed a wax and wane, but he successfully recovered by administration of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. These apparently different cases suggest that assertive screening and management could improve the clinical course. In addition, antiviral agents should be used cautiously, especially in patients on calcineurin inhibitors.","publish_time":1589587200000,"author_summary":" Kim, Yaerim; Kwon, Ohyun; Paek, Jin H.; Park,<br>Woo Y.; Jin, Kyubok; Hyun, Miri; Lee, Ji Y.; Kim,<br>Hyun A.; Han, Seungyeup","abstract_summary":" The fatality of novel coronavirus disease 2019<br>(COVID\u201019) is precipitously increased in patients with<br>underlying comorbidities or elderly people.

We will discuss our experience of 4 heart transplants with organs from DCD donors after normothermic regional perfusion (NRP). Our first heart transplant using a DCD organ was in January 2020, and the fourth was in March 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic. Our protocol using NRP allows us to evaluate the donor heart adequately to confidently determine organ acceptance. The co-location of the donor and the recipient in neighboring ORs limits ischemic times. Avoidance of an expensive ex-vivo organ perfusion machine is an additional benefit for programs that may not have the resources required to purchase and maintain the machine. Some hospitals may not have the resources and space to be able to co-locate both the donor and recipient. Use of cold storage may be an option to transport the procured organ, similar to DBD organs. We hope that this technique of NRP in DCD donors can help further increase the donor pool for heart transplantation in the US.","publish_time":1592956800000,"author_summary":" Ngai, Jennie; Masuno, Kiriko; Moazami, Nader","abstract_summary":" Worldwide, the majority of heart transplant<br>organs are from donation after brain death (DBD).<br>However, the shortage of suitable donors places severe<br>limitations on this route.

The MeSH terms used were \u201cCOVID-19\u201d AND \u201cTransplant.\u201d Thirty-nine COVID-19 cases were reported among SOT patients. The median interval for developing SARS-CoV-2 infection was 4 years since transplantation, and the fatality rate was 25.64% (10\/39). Sixteen cases were described in liver transplant (LT) patients, and the median interval since transplantation was 5 years. The fatality rate among LT patients was 37.5% (6\/16), with death occurring more than 3 years after LT. The youngest patient who died was 59 years old; there were no deaths among children. Twenty-three cases were described in kidney transplant (KT) patients. The median interval since transplantation was 4 years, and the fatality rate was 17.4% (4\/23). The youngest patient who died was 71 years old. Among all transplant patients, COVID-19 had the highest fatality rate in patients older than 60 years : LT, 62.5% vs 12.5% (p=0.006); KT 44.44% vs 0 (p=0.039); and SOT, 52.94% vs 4.54% (p=0.001). This study presents a novel description of COVID-19 in abdominal SOT recipients. Furthermore, we alert medical professionals to the higher fatality risk in patients older than 60 years.
