We present a methodology to probabilistically evaluate risk of infection given the network of contacts that individuals are likely to encounter in real life. Instead of binary \"infected\" or \"uninfected\" statuses, an infection risk probability is maintained which can be efficiently calculated based on probabilities of recent contacts, and updated when a recent contact is diagnosed with a disease. We demonstrate on realistic networks that this method sharply outperforms a naive immediate-contact method even in an ideal circumstance that all infected persons are known to the naive method. We demonstrate robustness to missing contact information (such as when phones fail to make bluetooth contact or the app is not installed). We show, within our model, a strong flattening of the infectious peak when even a small fraction of cases are identified, tested and isolated. In the real world, where most known-infected persons are isolated or quarantined and where many individuals may not carry their mobiles in public, we believe the improvement offered by our method warrants consideration.

Countries have responded with various levels of lockdown to save lives and stop health systems from being overwhelmed. At the same time, lockdowns entail large socio-economic costs. One exit strategy under consideration is a mobile phone app that traces close contacts of those infected with COVID- 19. Recent research has demonstrated the theoretical effectiveness of this solution in different disease settings. However, concerns have been raised about such apps because of the potential privacy implications. This could limit the acceptability of app-based contact tracing among the general population. As the effectiveness of this approach increases strongly with app take-up, it is crucial to understand public support for this intervention. Objectives: The objective of this study is to investigate user acceptability of a contact-tracing app in five countries hit by the pandemic. Methods We conducted a multi-country, large-scale (N = 5995) study to measure public support for digital contact tracing of COVID-19 infections. We ran anonymous online surveys in France, Germany, Italy, the UK and the US. We measured intentions to use a contact-tracing app across different installation regimes (voluntary installation vs. automatic installation by mobile phone providers), and studied how these intentions vary across individuals and countries. Results: We found strong support for the app under both regimes, in all countries, across all sub-groups of the population, and irrespective of regional-level COVID-19 mortality rates. We inves- tigated the main factors that may hinder or facilitate take-up and found that concerns about cyber security and privacy, together with lack of trust in government, are the main barriers to adoption. Conclusions: Epidemiological evidence shows that app-based contact-tracing can suppress the spread of COVID-19 if a high enough proportion of the population uses the app and that it can still reduce the number of infections if take-up is moderate. Our findings show that the willingness to install the app is very high. The available evidence suggests that app-based contact tracing may be a viable approach to control the diffusion of COVID-19.","publish_time":1588896000000,"author_summary":" Altmann, S.; Milsom, L.; Zillessen, H.;<br>Blasone, R.; Gerdon, F.; Bach, R.; Kreuter, F.; Nosenzo,<br>D.; Toussaert, S.; Abeler, J.","abstract_summary":" Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is the<br>greatest public health crisis of the last 100 years.<br>Countries have responded with various levels of lockdown<br>to save lives and stop health systems from being<br>overwhelmed.

However, assessing these interactions with surveys fails to capture their dynamic nature. While these behaviors can be captured with client-based passive sensing, these techniques are limited in scalability. By contrast, infrastructure-based approaches can scale to a large cohort and infer social interactions based on collocation of students. This paper investigates one such approach by leveraging WiFi association logs archived by a managed campus network. In their raw form, access point logs can approximate a student's location but with low spatio-temporal resolution. This paper first demonstrates that processing these logs can infer the collocation of 46 students in 34 lectures over 3 months, with a precision of 0.89 and a recall of 0.75. Next, we investigate how this WiFi-based coarse collocation reflects signals of social interaction. With 163 students in 54 project groups, we find that member performance shows a correlation of 0.75 with performance determined from collocation of groups through 14 weeks.

Doing this early would save millions of lives and help countries keep a stable economy. The easiest way to control the spread of a virus is to immediately inform the individuals who recently had close contact with the diagnosed patients. However, to achieve this, a centralized authority (e.g., a health authority) needs detailed location information from both healthy individuals and diagnosed patients. Thus, such an approach, although beneficial to control the spread of a virus, results in serious privacy concerns, and hence privacy-preserving solutions are required to solve this problem. Previous works on this topic either (i) compromise privacy (especially privacy of diagnosed patients) to have better efficiency or (ii) provide unscalable solutions. In this work, we propose a technique based on private set intersection between physical contact histories of individuals (that are recorded using smart phones) and a centralized database (run by a health authority) that keeps the identities of the positive diagnosed patients for the disease. Proposed solution protects the location privacy of both healthy individuals and diagnosed patients and it guarantees that the identities of the diagnosed patients remain hidden from other individuals. Notably, proposed scheme allows individuals to receive warning messages indicating their previous contacts with a positive diagnosed patient. Such warning messages will help them realize the risk and isolate themselves from other people. We make sure that the warning messages are only observed by the corresponding individuals and not by the health authority.

Currently, such functionality can be achieved using searchable encryption. Such cryptographic primitives provide provable guarantees for privacy, and allow decryption only when the location satisfies some predicate. Nevertheless, they rely on expensive pairing-based cryptography (PBC), of which direct application to the domain of location updates leads to impractical solutions. We propose secure and efficient techniques for private processing of location updates that complement the use of PBC and lead to significant gains in performance by reducing the amount of required pairing operations. We implement two optimizations that further improve performance: materialization of results to expensive mathematical operations, and parallelization. We also propose an heuristic that brings down the computational overhead through enlarging an alert zone by a small factor (given as system parameter), therefore trading off a small and controlled amount of privacy for significant performance gains.

As a result, authorities around the globe have expressed their needs for better tools to monitor the spread of the virus and to support human labor.

The goal of these applications is to continuously track people's proximity and to make the smartphone users aware if they have ever been in contact with positively diagnosed people, so that they could self-quarantine and possibly have an infection test. A fundamental challenge with these smartphone-based contact tracing technologies is to ensure the security and privacy of their users. Moving from manual to smartphone-based contact tracing creates new cyber risks that could suddenly affect the entire population. Major risks include for example the abuse of the people's private data by companies and\/or authorities, or the spreading of wrong alerts by malicious users in order to force individuals to go into quarantine. In April 2020, the Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) was announced with the goal to develop and evaluate secure solutions for European countries.

This paper introduces an alternative way to manual contact tracing. The proposed Smart Contact Tracing (SCT) system utilizes the smartphone's Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals and machine learning classifier to accurately and quickly determined the contact profile. SCT's contribution is two-fold: a) classification of the user's contact as high\/low-risk using precise proximity sensing, and b) user anonymity using a privacy-preserving communications protocol. SCT leverages BLE's non-connectable advertising feature to broadcast a signature packet when the user is in the public space. Both broadcasted and observed signatures are stored in the user's smartphone and they are only uploaded to a secure signature database when a user is confirmed by public health authorities to be infected. Using received signal strength (RSS) each smartphone estimates its distance from other user's phones and issues real-time alerts when social distancing rules are violated. The paper includes extensive experimentation utilizing real-life smartphone positions and a comparative evaluation of five machine learning classifiers. Reported results indicate that a decision tree classifier outperforms other states of the art classification methods in terms of accuracy.

A centralized approach, where data sensed by the app are all sent to a nation-wide server, raises concerns about citizens' privacy and needlessly strong digital surveillance, thus alerting us to the need to minimize personal data collection and avoiding location tracking. We advocate the conceptual advantage of a decentralized approach, where both contact and location data are collected exclusively in individual citizens'\"personal data stores\", to be shared separately and selectively, voluntarily, only when the citizen has tested positive for COVID-19, and with a privacy preserving level of granularity. This approach better protects the personal sphere of citizens and affords multiple benefits: it allows for detailed information gathering for infected people in a privacy-preserving fashion; and, in turn this enables both contact tracing, and, the early detection of outbreak hotspots on more finely-granulated geographic scale. Our recommendation is two-fold. First to extend existing decentralized architectures with a light touch, in order to manage the collection of location data locally on the device, and allow the user to share spatio-temporal aggregates - if and when they want, for specific aims - with health authorities, for instance. Second, we favour a longer-term pursuit of realizing a Personal Data Store vision, giving users the opportunity to contribute to collective good in the measure they want, enhancing self-awareness, and cultivating collective efforts for rebuilding society.","publish_time":1586476800000,"author_summary":" Nanni, Mirco; Andrienko, Gennady; Barab'asi,<br>Albert-L'aszl'o; Boldrini, Chiara; Bonchi, Francesco;<br>Cattuto, Ciro; Chiaromonte, Francesca; Comand'e,<br>Giovanni; Conti, Marco; Cot'e, Mark; Dignum, Frank;<br>Dignum, Virginia; Domingo-Ferrer, Josep; Ferragina,<br>Paolo; Giannotti, Fosca; Guidotti, Riccardo;<br>Helbing, Dirk; Kaski, Kimmo; Kertesz, Janos; Lehmann,<br>Sune; Lepri, Bruno; Lukowicz, Paul; Matwin, Stan;<br>Jim'enez, David Meg'ias; Monreale, Anna; Morik,<br>Katharina; Oliver, Nuria; Passarella, Andrea;<br>Passerini, Andrea; Pedreschi, Dino; Pentland, Alex;<br>Pianesi, Fabio; Pratesi, Francesca; Rinzivillo,<br>Salvatore; Ruggieri, Salvatore; Siebes, Arno; Trasarti,<br>Roberto; Hoven, Jeroen van den; Vespignani, Alessandro","abstract_summary":" The rapid dynamics of COVID-19 calls for quick<br>and effective tracking of virus transmission<br>chains and early detection of outbreaks, especially<br>in the phase 2 of the pandemic, when lockdown and<br>other restriction measures are progressively<br>withdrawn, in order to avoid or minimize contagion<br>resurgence.

For this purpose, contact tracing using smartphones is being considered as a promising technique. Here, smartphones emit and scan for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals for detecting devices in range. When a device is detected, its distance is estimated by evaluating its received signal strength. The main insight that is exploited for distance estimation is that the attenuation of a signal increases with the distance along which it has traveled. However, besides distance, there are multiple additional factors that impact the attenuation and hence disturb distance estimation. Among them, frequency selective hardware and signal propagation belong to the most significant ones. For example, a BLE device transmits beacons on three different frequencies (channels), while the transmit power and the receiver sensitivity depend on the frequency. As a result, the received signal strength varies for each channel, even when the distance remains constant. However, the information on which wireless channel a beacon has been received is not made available to a smartphone. Hence, this error cannot be compensated, e.g., by calibration. In this paper, we for the first time provide a solution to detect the wireless channel on which a packet has been received on a smartphone. We experimentally evaluate our proposed technique on multiple different smartphone models.

Also known as antibody or health certificates, there is a clear demand for any technology that could allow people to return to work and other crowded places without placing others at risk. One of the major criticisms of such systems is that they could be misused to unfairly discriminate against those without immunity, allowing the formation of an `immuno-privileged' class of people. In this work we are motivated to explore an alternative technical solution that is non-discriminatory by design. In particular we propose health tokens -- randomised health certificates which, using methods from differential privacy, allow individual test results to be randomised whilst still allowing useful aggregate risk estimates to be calculated. We show that health tokens could mitigate immunity-based discrimination whilst still presenting a viable mechanism for estimating the collective transmission risk posed by small groups of users.

Our experimental results show that for groups of size 500 or more, the error associated with our method can be as low as 0.03 on average and thus the aggregated results can be useful in a number of identity-free contexts.

In order to overcome these drawbacks, digital contact tracing has been proposed that typically involves deploying a contact tracing application on people's mobile devices which can track their movements and close social interactions. While studies suggest that digital contact tracing is more effective than manual contact tracing, it has been observed that higher adoption rates of the contact tracing app may result in a better controlled epidemic. This also increases the confidence in the accuracy of the collected data and the subsequent analytics. One key reason for low adoption rate of contact tracing applications is the concern about individual privacy. In fact, several studies report that contact tracing applications deployed in multiple countries are not privacy friendly and have potential to be used for mass surveillance by the concerned governments. Hence, privacy respecting contact tracing application is the need of the hour that can lead to highly effective, efficient contact tracing. As part of this study, we focus on various cryptographic techniques that can help in addressing the Private Set Intersection problem which lies at the heart of privacy respecting contact tracing. We analyze the computation and communication complexities of these techniques under the typical client-server architecture utilized by contact tracing applications.

In view of this tug-of-war between one's privacy and public safety, this work aims to deepen the understanding of privacy risks of contact trace data disclosure practices in South Korea. Method: In this study, publicly available contact trace data of 970 confirmed patients were collected from seven metropolitan cities in South Korea (20th Jan\u201320th Apr 2020). Then, an ordinal scale of relative privacy risk levels was introduced for evaluation, and the assessment was performed on the personal information included in the contact trace data, such as demographics, significant places, sensitive information, social relationships, and routine behaviors. In addition, variance of privacy risk levels was examined across regions and over time to check for differences in policy implementation. Results: It was found that most of the contact trace data showed the gender and age of the patients. In addition, it disclosed significant places (home\/work) ranging across different levels of privacy risks in over 70% of the cases. Inference on sensitive information (hobby, religion) was made possible, and 48.7% of the cases exposed the patient's social relationships. In terms of regional differences, a considerable discrepancy was found in the privacy risk for each category. Despite the recent release of government guidelines on data disclosure, its effects were still limited to a few factors (e.g., workplaces, routine behaviors). Discussion: Privacy risk assessment showed evidence of superfluous information disclosure in the current practice. This study discusses the role of \u201cidentifiability\u201d in contact tracing to provide new directions for minimizing disclosure of privacy infringing information. Analysis of real-world data can offer potential stakeholders, such as researchers, service developers, and government officials with practical protocols\/guidelines in publicizing information of patients and design implications for future systems (e.g., automatic privacy sensitivity checking) to strike a balance between one's privacy and the public benefits with data disclosure.","publish_time":1592438400000,"author_summary":" Jung, Gyuwon; Lee, Hyunsoo; Kim, Auk; Lee,<br>Uichin","abstract_summary":" Introduction: With the COVID-19 outbreak,<br>South Korea has been making contact trace data public<br>to help people self-check if they have been in<br>contact with a person infected with the coronavirus.<br>Despite its benefits in suppressing the spread of the<br>virus, publicizing contact trace data raises<br>concerns about individuals' privacy.

This leads to continual violations of individual privacy, as sensitive health records are put at risk in unmasked maps. New approaches to geographic masking are required that foster accessibility and ease of use, such that they become more widely adopted. This article describes a new geographic masking method, called street masking, that reduces the burden on users of finding supplemental population data by instead automatically retrieving OpenStreetMap data and using the road network as a basis for masking. We compare it to donut geomasking, both with and without population density taken into account, to evaluate its efficacy against geographic masks that require slightly less and slightly more supplemental data. Our analysis is performed on synthetic data in three different Canadian cities. RESULTS: Street masking performs similarly to population-based donut geomasking with regard to privacy protection, achieving comparable k-anonymity values at similar median displacement distances. As expected, distance-based donut geomasking performs worst at privacy protection. Street masking also performs very well regarding information loss, achieving far better cluster preservation and landcover agreement than population-based donut geomasking. Distance-based donut geomasking performs similarly to street masking, though at the cost of reduced privacy protection. CONCLUSION: Street masking competes with, if not out-performs population-based donut geomasking and does so without requiring any supplemental data from users. Moreover, unlike most other geographic masks, it significantly minimizes the risk of false attribution and inherently takes many geographic barriers into account.

Contact tracing using smartphone technology is a powerful tool that may be employed to limit disease transmission during an epidemic or pandemic; yet, contact tracing apps present significant privacy concerns regarding the collection of personal data such as location. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop an effective contact tracing smartphone app that respects user privacy by not collecting location information or other personal data. METHODS: We propose the use of an anonymized graph of interpersonal interactions to conduct a novel form of contact tracing and have developed a proof-of-concept smartphone app that implements this approach. Additionally, we developed a computer simulation model that demonstrates the impact of our proposal on epidemic or pandemic outbreak trajectories across multiple rates of adoption. RESULTS: Our proof-of-concept smartphone app allows users to create \u201ccheckpoints\u201d for contact tracing, check their risk level based on their past interactions, and anonymously self-report a positive status to their peer network. Our simulation results suggest that higher adoption rates of such an app may result in a better controlled epidemic or pandemic outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed smartphone-based contact tracing method presents a novel solution that preserves privacy while demonstrating the potential to suppress an epidemic or pandemic outbreak. This app could potentially be applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic as well as other epidemics or pandemics in the future to achieve a middle ground between drastic isolation measures and unmitigated disease spread.","publish_time":1586217600000,"author_summary":" Yasaka, Tyler M; Lehrich, Brandon M; Sahyouni,<br>Ronald","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease<br>2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an urgent public health<br>crisis, with epidemiologic models predicting severe<br>consequences, including high death rates, if the virus is<br>permitted to run its course without any intervention or<br>response.

However, sensitive information can be derived from movement patterns, thus protecting the privacy of mobile users is a major concern. Users may only be willing to disclose their locations when some condition is met, for instance in proximity of a disaster area or an event of interest. Currently, such functionality can be achieved using searchable encryption. Such cryptographic primitives provide provable guarantees for privacy, and allow decryption only when the location satisfies some predicate. Nevertheless, they rely on expensive pairing-based cryptography (PBC), of which direct application to the domain of location updates leads to impractical solutions. We propose secure and efficient techniques for private processing of location updates that complement the use of PBC and lead to significant gains in performance by reducing the amount of required pairing operations. We implement two optimizations that further improve performance: materialization of results to expensive mathematical operations, and parallelization. We also propose an heuristic that brings down the computational overhead through enlarging an alert zone by a small factor (given as system parameter), therefore trading off a small and controlled amount of privacy for significant performance gains. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed techniques significantly improve performance compared to the baseline, and reduce the searchable encryption overhead to a level that is practical in a computing environment with reasonable resources, such as the cloud.","publish_time":1592265600000,"author_summary":" Ghinita, Gabriel; Nguyen, Kien; Maruseac,<br>Mihai; Shahabi, Cyrus","abstract_summary":" Monitoring location updates from mobile users<br>has important applications in many areas, ranging<br>from public health (e.g., COVID-19 contact<br>tracing) and national security to social networks and<br>advertising.
