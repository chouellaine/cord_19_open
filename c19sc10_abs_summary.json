{"cluster": 19, "subcluster": 10, "abstract_summ": " The effect of titanium dioxide concentration on the thermodynamical and rheological properties on the polyvinylidene fluoride casting solution was investigated by the triangle phase diagram and viscosity measurement . It was concluded that titanium dioxide introduction caused thermodynamic enhancement, but the impact of rheology hinderance was higher at high concentrations ."}
