{"cluster": 14, "subcluster": 0, "abstract_summ": " Global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has reached over five million confirmed cases worldwide . Despite the wide outbreak of the infection, a remarkable asymmetry is observed in the number of cases and in the distribution of the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms in patients with respect to the countries/regions . We introduce a binary classifier based on an artificial neural network that can help in explaining those differences ."}
