Meanwhile, the LFD-RPA assay specifically amplified PDCoV, while there was no cross-amplification with other swine-associated viruses, including Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), Porcine kobuvirus (PKoV), Foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and Seneca valley virus (SVV).The limit of detection of LFS RPA assay was 1.0 \u00d7 10(1) copies per reaction using a recombinant plasmid containing target gene as template, which is 10 times lower than the limit of detection of the real-time RPA and real-time PCR assays.", "title_summ": "An enzyme-based immunodetection assay to quantify SARS-CoV-2 infectionValidation of the easyscreen flavivirus dengue alphavirus detection kit based on 3base amplification technology and its application to the 2016/17 Vanuatu dengue outbreakValidation of specific quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay panel for Infectious Bronchitis using synthetic DNA standards and clinical specimensRapid detection of African swine fever virus using Cas12a-based portable paper diagnosticsATeam technology for detecting early signs of viral cytopathic effectDevelopment of a Multiplex RT-qPCR for the Detection of Different Clades of Avian Influenza in PoultryOne-step multiplex TaqMan probe-based method for real-time PCR detection of four canine diarrhea virusesA new multiplex RT-qPCR method for the simultaneous detection and discrimination of Zika and chikungunya virusesDetection of bovine viral diarrhea virus genotype 1 in aerosol by a real time RT-PCR assayDevelopment and validation of the isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification assays for rapid detection of Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae in sheepRapid and visual detection of porcine deltacoronavirus by recombinase polymerase amplification combined with a lateral flow dipstickEstablishment of a Porcine Parvovirus (PPV) LAMP Visual Rapid Detection MethodPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus: Viral RNA detection and quantification using a validated one-step real time RT-PCRDevelopment of a real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification method for the detection of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virusAn ultra-rapid real-time RT-PCR method for detecting human orthopneumovirus using PCR1100.Development of a real-time PCR assay for detection of African swine fever virus with an endogenous internal control.Detection of Phytophthora infestans by Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification, Real-Time LAMP, and Droplet Digital PCR.Advances in laboratory assays for detecting human metapneumovirus.", "title_abstract_phrases": "This assay was specific for detection of BVDV-1, and no amplification was found for other pestiviruses such as classical swine fever virus (CSFV), border disease virus (BDV), and common infectious bovine viruses, including BVDV-2, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV), bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV-3), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) and bovine coronavirus (BcoV).The LAMP detection method for PPV represents a visual, sensitive and rapid assay which can detect the virus in the field, offering an attractive alternative for the PPV detection methods currently in use.The limit of detection of LFS RPA assay was 1.0 \u00d7 10(1) copies per reaction using a recombinant plasmid containing target gene as template, which is 10 times lower than the limit of detection of the real-time RPA and real-time PCR assays.Detection of bovine viral diarrhea virus genotype 1 in aerosol by a real time RT-PCR assayBACKGROUND: As a pestivirus of the Flaviviridae family, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), has imposed a large burden on animal husbandry worldwide, and such virus can be transmitted mainly through direct contact with other infected animals and probably via aerosols.We developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for P. infestans and compared this assay to conventional PCR, real-time LAMP, and droplet digital PCR for detection of P. infestans."}
