{"cluster": 23, "subcluster": 239, "abstract_summ": " In this paper, a delayed SIQR epidemic model with vaccination and elimination hybrid strategies is analysed under a white noise perturbation . We establish a stochastic threshold [Formula: see text] in order to study the extinction and persistence in mean of the model . Sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the epidemic disease is extinct and persistent in mean ."}
