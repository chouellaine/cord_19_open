{"cluster": 52, "subcluster": 2, "abstract_summ": "It was shown that management of PICU beds by an intensivist resulted in increased number of patients per year per PICU bed, increased care of true critical care patients who are in need of more intensive therapies and invasive procedures including extracorporeal treatment options, decreased length of stay, decreased number and rate of nosocomial infections, and decreased mortality rate.Conclusion and Relevance Leaders of health organizations need to engage with one another and with their professional teams to assure that roles and responsibilities are clear and that teams are both prepared to provide the highest quality and efficient care in critical care and in disaster.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The program has demonstrated numerous benefits including shared best practices related to critical care clinical services, expansion and refinement of care delivery models, development and optimization of research programs, and advancement of new training programs including specialty pharmacy residencies.The purpose of this study was to compare short-term satisfaction with care and decision making in patients or surrogates between two neurocritical care units [one staffed by a neurocritical care attending and advanced practice providers (APPs) and one staffed by a neurocritical care attending and resident/fellow trainees] using the Family Satisfaction in the ICU (FS-ICU) survey.CONCLUSIONS: A professional organization led visiting clinical professor program is viable, sustainable, and yields clear benefit for critical care pharmacy programs across the country.", "title_summ": "Schedule-based Family-centered Rounds: A Novel Approach to Achieve High Nursing Attendance and ParticipationA
