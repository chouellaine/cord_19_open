Furthermore, natural disasters (e.g. heat waves, severe storms, floods and large forest fires) are becoming more frequent. The impact of global warming and climate change on health involves an increase in respiratory, cardiovascular, renal and cognitive mental diseases. Furthermore, a change in the frequency and patterns of infectious diseases can also be observed in Europe. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This article presents the most important studies that investigated diseases associated with the climate change, with special reference to those that represent a challenge for intensive care medicine. RESULTS: Currently available epidemiological data and statistical extrapolations indicate that diseases resulting from the climate change (acute infection-related respiratory and intestinal diseases, exacerbation of pre-existing pulmonary lesions, heat-related dehydration, cerebral insults and myocardial infarction) are relevant for intensive care medicine. Particular emphasis is placed on a significant increase in acute kidney damage during heat waves. A previously unknown pattern of infectious diseases necessitates new knowledge and targeted management. In some studies, persisting mental impairments were registered during heat waves and natural disasters, e.g. posttraumatic stress disorder. CONCLUSION: Intensive care medicine must be prepared for the challenges due to global warming and climate change. Slow but continuous changes (e.g. rise in temperature) as well as acute changes (e.g. heat waves and natural disasters) will induce an increased need for intensive medical care services (e.g. an increase in the need for renal replacement procedures). Intensive care physicians will need to be familiar with the diagnostics and management of diseases associated with the climate change. An initiative of the specialist societies involved would be welcomed.","publish_time":1589241600000,"author_summary":" Bein, T.; Karagiannidis, C.; Gr\u00fcndling, M.;<br>Quintel, M.","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: In the last five decades a<br>continuous increase in the average global temperature has<br>been recorded.

OBJECTIVES: The special medical and insurance law aspects of a work-related MRSA colonization are presented using the example of an expert opinion case and an evaluation of the BK reports of suspected occupational disease (BK No. 3101) of the German Social Accident Insurance (DGUV). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The BK documentation of the DGUV from 2007\u20132012 and the patient cohort from the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Erlangen, presenting for expert assessment from 2007\u20132012 were retrospectively analysed for human-to-human transmitted infectious diseases of the skin (BK-No. 3101). RESULTS: Person-to-person transmission of infectious diseases of the skin is rare in the field of occupational dermatology. In the DGUV cohort, suspected BK-No. 3101cases amounted to 2.6% of all notified cases; recognized BK-No. 3101 cases accounted for 4.2% of all recognized cases, amongst which 9 were caused by MRSA. In contrast to a symptomatic infection, an asymptomatic MRSA colonization is not being recognized as BK-No. 3101. Bacterial superantigens can trigger atopic dermatitis (AD). In particular cases, occupationally acquired MRSA can elicit AD and may justify classification as an OD (BK-No. 3101).

Declaring a state of health emergency in order to curb a frightening epidemic, the authorities have decreed the home confinement of the majority of the population of our country for several weeks. In a few days, innumerable questions arise for very diverse spaces: epidemiological, immunological, sociological, information scientists, medical, administrative, political, etc. Objective. \u2013 We propose a reflection intended to describe the psychological risks, to clarify the disorders found and, to discuss the means to take care of them in the duration. Material and methods. \u2013 We base our thinking on a review of the literature confronted with our current clinical experience, including concerning the possibilities of dematerialized medico-psychological monitoring. Results. \u2013 We recall the collective repercussions of emerging lethal mass risks, and in particular viral infectious agents, before approaching the existing scientific models of collective confinement according to military operations in hostile zones, polar wintering missions and aerospace conquest. It appears that for the study of a global containment, somewhat studied during previous pandemics, the conceptions of stress reaction and psychodynamic adaptation prove to be relevant. We detail the psychological consequences of confinement on individual mental health and their countermeasures according to three population typologies: general population, population of caregivers on the front line against the epidemic, and population of subjects already suffering from mental illness or seeing their disorders reappear. We also refer to works in social cognitive psychology explaining how, in an anxiety-provoking situation, reasoning can be biased and lead to choices that ultimately prove to be not very rational, in the opinion of those who made them. The current situation in the health sector is favorable in this, as evidenced by the \"debate on chloroquine\" widely reported in the media and on social networks, opposing conclusions most often decided on the basis of beliefs on contrary to evidence based medicine. Discussion. \u2013 The psychological repercussions of confinement appear conditioned by the multiple forms that it can take: voluntary or suffered, more or less prolonged, spent at home or in another place, lived in individual isolation or in a small community, associated other stressors and\/or traumatic factors, etc. The home confinement of a population across a country has never been assessed. This experience seems to us to confront our society as a whole with the taboo of death which is imposed, death more and more evaded as the \"Western man\" tries to move away from his terrestrial origins. In this sense, psychotraumatic type repercussions are to be prevented. In order to face multiple challenges, the healthcare system has adapted with, in particular, the development of the use of the Internet for the provision of information intended to better experience confinement, or even the generalization of psychotherapy remotely asking as many questions as it provides answers. These intricacies of computer techniques in the area of psychotherapy, techniques with which we had some mistrust, became established as quickly as the virus: the task of clinicians and researchers to measure the issues and the consequences. Conclusion. \u2013 Public health programs could emerge on the model of those already existing in order to manage well-known chronic endemic disorders: protection against the effects of an unbalanced diet associated with a sedentary lifestyle, fight against smoking and alcoholism, prevention of self-aggressive behavior, etc. We will also need to support the caregivers who have been on the front line and who will emerge tested from this pandemic: will depend on the sustainability of the action capacities of our healthcare system to return to its nominal state and also perhaps, so that it can face other crises, especially social ones.","publish_time":1591315200000,"author_summary":" Aux\u00e9m\u00e9ry, Yann; Tarquinio, Cyril","abstract_summary":" Background. \u2013 The situation we are currently<br>experiencing is unprecedented.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this online survey was to assess the changes and current status of rheumatology departments and practices in Germany. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was designed to differentiate the impact of the pandemic on inpatient and outpatient operations. Questions addressed the following issues: characteristics of the department, impact on patient care, application of recommendations, personal protective equipment (PPE), and organizational adaptations to the new framework conditions. The survey was available for 14 days and closed on 3 May 2020. RESULTS: A total of 66 complete answers were recorded and evaluated. In the first 4 weeks of the COVID-19 crisis the proportion of outpatients in the institutions decreased on average by \u221240.6%. The number of outpatients receiving infusions decreased by \u221225.6%. Of the inpatient facilities 81% reported an average decrease of hospitalized patients of \u221254.9% and 52% of the participants complained of a lack of PPE. Organizational adjustments are reported. CONCLUSION: The rheumatological services were significantly reduced 4 weeks after the SARS-CoV\u20112 pandemic had reached Germany on a large scale. The study showed that in this phase there were decisive turning points in patient care and implicated substantial organizational and ultimately also economic effects on the healthcare system, both in hospitals and private practices.

More specifically, it affects people with various risk factors, which are more frequent in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders. Psychiatrists need to know: (i) how to identify, the risks associated with the prescription of psychotropic drugs and which can prove to be counterproductive in their association with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), (ii) how to assess in terms of benefit\/risk ratio, the implication of any hasty and brutal modification on psychotropic drugs that can induce confusion for a differential diagnosis with the evolution of COVID-19. We carried out a review of the literature aimed at assessing the specific benefit\/risk ratio of psychotropic treatments in patients suffering from COVID-19. Clinically, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (fever, cough, dyspnea, digestive signs) can be caused by various psychotropic drugs and require vigilance to avoid false negatives and false positives. In infected patients, psychotropic drugs should be used with caution, especially in the elderly, considering the pulmonary risk. Lithium and Clozapine, which are the reference drugs in bipolar disorder and resistant schizophrenia, warrant specific attention. For these two treatments the possibility of a reduction in the dosage \u2013 in case of minimal infectious signs and in a situation, which does not allow rapid control \u2013 should ideally be considered taking into account the clinical response (even biological; plasma concentrations) observed in the face of previous dose reductions. Tobacco is well identified for its effects as an inducer of CYP1A2 enzyme. In a COVID+ patient, the consequences of an abrupt cessation of smoking, particularly related with the appearance of respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea), must therefore be anticipated for patients receiving psychotropics metabolized by CYP1A2. Plasma concentrations of these drugs are expected to decrease and can be related to an increase risk of relapse. The symptomatic treatments used in COVID-19 have frequent interactions with the most used psychotropics. If there is no curative treatment for infection to SARS-CoV-2, the interactions of the various molecules currently tested with several classes of psychotropic drugs (antidepressants, antipsychotics) are important to consider because of the risk of changes in cardiac conduction. Specific knowledge on COVID-19 remains poor today, but we must recommend rigor in this context in the use of psychotropic drugs, to avoid adding, in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders, potentially vulnerable in the epidemic context, an iatrogenic risk or loss of efficiency.","publish_time":1588550400000,"author_summary":" Javelot, H.; Llorca, P.-M.; Drapier, D.;<br>Fakra, E.; Hingray, C.; Meyer, G.; Dizet, S.; Egron,<br>A.; Straczek, C.; Roser, M.; Masson, M.; Gaillard,<br>R.; Fossati, P.; Haffen, E.","abstract_summary":" The 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic<br>(SARS-CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome<br>coronavirus 2) has dramatic consequences on populations in<br>terms of morbidity and mortality and in social terms,<br>the general confinement of almost half of the<br>world's population being a situation unprecedented in<br>history, which is difficult today to measure the impact<br>at the individual and collective levels.

METHODS: This study evaluated 12 case series from China with 6\u20132143 children infected with SARS-CoV\u20112, which were identified by a literature search in PubMed up to 31 March 2020. The database of the German nationwide DGPI COVID-19 survey was accessed on 6 April 2020. RESULTS: The median patient age in the case series was between 2 and 7 years and 18\u201345% were infants <1 year of age. The duration of hospital stay was 5\u201320 days. Most commonly reported symptoms were fever and cough; in 40\u2013100% of cases involvement of the lower respiratory tract was reported, usually confirmed by computed tomography (CT). Severe and critical courses of disease were reported in up to 8% of the children including 2 fatalities. So far the German DGPI COVID-19 survey reported 33 hospitalized children up to 6 April 2020, mostly with upper airway infections. Of these children, 45% were infants and 32% had an underlying medical condition. So far 3 children (9%) needed admission to an intensive care unit. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 in hospitalized children usually presented as an uncomplicated febrile upper airway infection or mild pneumonia. Severe cases or fatalities rarely occurred in children.

They had mild forms of COVID-19 and non-specific clinical signs with the exception of agueusia\/anosmia, which was significantly more common in those with positive RT-PCR. The rate of RT-PCR positivity was 38% overall, without significant difference according to profession. It was higher among external consultants (47% versus 31%). In the hospital, this rate was significantly lower for symptomatic staff in the care sectors, compared to staff in the technical platforms and laboratories (24%, versus 45%, p = 0.006 and 54%, respectively, p < 0.001), but did not differ between staff in COVID units and other care sectors (30% versus 28%). Among the external consultants, the positivity rates of nursing home and private practices staff (53% and 55% respectively) were more than double that of acute care hospital staff (24%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the strong impact of COVID-19 on health professionals. The higher positivity rates among symptomatic professionals working outside the hospital compared to those working in hospital may be explained in part by a shortage of protective equipment and by difficulties in accessing virological diagnosis, which were greater outside the hospital when the epidemic began.","publish_time":1594166400000,"author_summary":" Greffe, S.; Espinasse, F.; Duran, C.; Labrune,<br>S.; Sirol, M.; Mantalvan, B.; Gramer, M.C.;<br>Babulle, C.; Do Rosario, G.; Vauvillier, Q.; Huet, A.;<br>Van der Heidjen, A.; Tysebaert, J.; Kramarz, L.F.;<br>Rabes, J.-P.; Pellissier, G.; Chinet, T.; Moreau, F.;<br>Rouveix, E.","abstract_summary":" INTRODUCTION: A consultation dedicated to<br>symptomatic health professionals was opened at the<br>beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in order to meet the<br>specific needs of this population.

He enforced a hand-washing policy for physicians. Those with unwashed hands were disallowed into labor room. The hand-washing practice for 1 year led to unprecedented decrease in maternal mortality.

Although not accepted during his lifetime, this causal hypothesis contributed significantly to the understanding of etiopathophysiology of not only puerperal fever but also many other communicable diseases.

Based on a simplified model of approximated and plausible parameters for the overall attack rate (AR), the AR(hospitalization) and the AR(ICU admission), the resources needed are compared with the available resources i.e. number of beds available in general and beds in ICU in particular. The calculations are carried out population-based for Ploen County as well as regionally together with the Kiel metropolitan area. RESULTS: Since the ARs in the up do date available cohorts are overestimated, considerably lower AR(hospitalization) and AR(ICU) should be expected. An AR(hospitalization) of 10% could not be materialized in Ploen County; one with 5% could. In the regional analysis together with the University Hospital Kiel (UKSH) an AR(hospitalization) of up to 10% is feasible, as also an AR(ICU) of 3%. The kinetics of hospital admissions is, however, dependent from countermeasures in public health as well as admission habits of the family physicians. The available number of beds is determined by beds made available and by the mean duration of hospitalization. The latter depends from the age and underlying conditions of the patients.

Abstract Objective: The lack of ressources and coordination to face the epidemic of coronavirus raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we keep in memory the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. Methods: authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. Results: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: 1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with covid-19; 2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); 3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and 4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and\/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of COVID + units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist \/ infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. Discussion: French mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.","publish_time":1585785600000,"author_summary":" Chevance, A; Gourion, D; Hoertel, N; Llorca,<br>P-M; Thomas, P; Bocher, R; Moro, M-R; Lapr\u00e9vote, V;<br>Benyamina, A; Fossati, P; Masson, M; Leaune, E; Leboyer, M;<br>Gaillard, R","abstract_summary":" R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Objectif: L\u2019absence de pr\u00e9paration du<br>syst\u00e8me de soins psychiatriques \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pid\u00e9mie de virus<br>SARS-CoV-2 fait redouter fait redouter un sc\u00e9nario<br>pessimiste pour la sant\u00e9 physique et mentale des patients<br>suivis en psychiatrie.

Thus, the recommendations for carrying out operations should always be adapted to the current, regional and epidemiological situation of the hospital.

The interest in anti-coronavirus drug development has been limited so far and effective methods to prevent or treat coronavirus infections in humans are still lacking. Urgent action is needed to fight this fatal coronavirus infection by reducing the number of infected people along with the infection contagiousness and severity. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak several weeks ago, we observe in GHU PARIS Psychiatrie & Neurosciences (Sainte-Anne hospital, Paris, France) a lower prevalence of symptomatic and severe forms of COVID-19 infections in psychiatric patients (\u223c4 %) compared to health care professionals (\u223c14 %). Similar observations have been noted in other psychiatric units in France and abroad. Our hypothesis is that psychiatric patients could be protected from the severe form of COVID-19 by their psychotropic treatments. Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a phenothiazine derivative widely used in clinical routine in the treatment of acute and chronic psychoses. This first antipsychotic medication has been discovered in 1952 by Jean Delay and Pierre Deniker at Sainte-Anne hospital. In addition to its antipsychotic effects, several in vitro studies have also demonstrated a CPZ antiviral activity via the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Recently, independent studies revealed that CPZ is an anti-MERS-CoV and an anti-SARS-CoV-1 drug. In comparison to other antiviral drugs, the main advantages of CPZ lie in its biodistribution: (i) preclinical and clinical studies have reported a high CPZ concentration in the lungs (20--200 times higher than in plasma), which is critical because of the respiratory tropism of SARS-CoV-2; (ii) CPZ is highly concentrated in saliva (20-60 times higher than in plasma) and could therefore reduce the contagiousness of COVID-19; (iii) CPZ can cross the blood-brain barrier and could therefore prevent the neurological forms of COVID-19. METHODS: In this context, we will test the hypothesis that CPZ could decrease the unfavorable evolution of COVID-19 infection in oxygen-requiring patients without the need for intensive care, but also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2. At this end, we designed a pilot, phase III, multicenter, single blind, randomized controlled therapeutic trial. Efficacy of CPZ will be assessed according to clinical, biological and radiological criteria. The main objective is to demonstrate a shorter Time To Response (TTR) to treatment in the CPZ + standard-of-care (CPZ + SOC) group, compared to the SOC group. Response to treatment is defined by a reduction of at least one level of severity on the WHO-Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (WHO-OSCI). The secondary objectives are to demonstrate in the CPZ + SOC group, compared to the SOC group: A) superior clinical improvement; B) a greater decrease in the biological markers of viral attack by SARS-CoV-2 (PCR, viral load); C) a greater decrease in inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP and lymphopenia); D) a greater decrease in parenchymal involvement (chest CT) on the seventh day post-randomization; E) to define the optimal dosage of CPZ and its tolerance; F) to evaluate the biological parameters of response to treatment, in particular the involvement of inflammatory cytokines. Patient recruitment along with the main and secondary objectives are in line with WHO 2020 COVID-19 guidelines. CONCLUSION: This repositioning of CPZ as anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity offers an alternative and rapid strategy to alleviate the virus propagation and the infection severity and lethality. This CPZ repositioning strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps, can save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easy to manage side effects. Indeed, CPZ is an FDA-approved drug with an excellent tolerance profile, prescribed for around 70 years, in psychiatry but also in clinical routine in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, in advanced cancer and also to treat headaches in various neurological conditions. The broad spectrum of CPZ treatment - including antipsychotic, anxiolytic, antiemetic, antiviral, immunomodulatory effects along with inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and modulation of blood-brain barrier - is in line with the historical French commercial name for CPZ, i.e. LARGACTIL, chosen as a reference to its 'LARGe ACTion' properties. The discovery of those CPZ properties, as for many other molecules in psychiatry, is both the result of serendipity and careful clinical observations. Using this approach, the field of mental illness could provide innovative therapeutic approaches to fight SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":1588118400000,"author_summary":" Plaze, Mario; Attali, David; Petit,<br>Anne-C\u00e9cile; Blatzer, Michael; Simon-Loriere, Etienne;<br>Vinckier, Fabien; Cachia, Arnaud; Chr\u00e9tien, Fabrice;<br>Gaillard, Rapha\u00ebl","abstract_summary":" Abstract OBJECTIVES: The ongoing COVID-19<br>pandemic comprises a total of more than 2 350 000 cases and<br>160 000 deaths.

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit. In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS. The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure. This consensus guidance should serve as a foundation for optimized supportive care to ensure the best possible chance for survival and to allow for reliable comparison of investigational therapeutic interventions as part of randomized controlled trials.","publish_time":1585526400000,"author_summary":" Cinesi G\u00f3mez, C\u00e9sar; Pe\u00f1uelas Rodr\u00edguez,<br>\u00d3scar; Luj\u00e1n Torn\u00e9, Manel; Egea Santaolalla, Carlos;<br>Masa Jim\u00e9nez, Juan Fernando; Garc\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez,<br>Javier; Carratal\u00e1 Perales, Jos\u00e9 Manuel;<br>Heili-Frades, Sarah B\u00e9atrice; Ferrer Monreal, Miquel; de<br>Andr\u00e9s Nilsson, Jos\u00e9 M.; Lista Arias, Eva; S\u00e1nchez<br>Rocamora, Juan Luis; Garrote, Jos\u00e9 Ignacio; Zamorano<br>Serrano, Miguel J.; Gonz\u00e1lez Mart\u00ednez, M\u00f3nica; Farrero<br>Mu\u00f1oz, Eva; Mediano San Andr\u00e9s, Olga; Rialp Cervera,<br>Gemma; Mas Serra, Arantxa; Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez,<br>Gonzalo; de Haro L\u00f3pez, Candelaria; Roca Gas, Oriol;<br>Ferrer Roca, Ricard; Romero Berrocal, Antonio;<br>Ferrando Ortola, Carlos","abstract_summary":" Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a<br>respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent<br>coronavirus, that was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in<br>December 2019.

This article summarizes the evidence on standards for personal protective equipment for personnel in the central emergency admission department and in the operations area as well as restructuring measures for the procedures in the operations area in a COVID-plus area. METHOD: A systematic literature search was carried out. RESULTS: The grey area of unknown infected and potential transmitters of SARS-CoV-2\/COVID-19 is high. Patients with an unclear infection status or who are highly suspected of having an infection should be classified as infectious until the contrary can be proven. The protection of personnel in healthcare professions against infections is of particular importance. The supply of adequate personal protective equipment in a risk-stratified form can substantially influence the success of combating the pandemic. Most operations must be assessed as aerosol-forming procedures and necessitate the maximum protection of personnel working directly on the patient. Particular attention should be paid to obligatory hygiene regulatory measures for protection against contamination during the reorganization in the operations area and on the transport routes between the wards. CONCLUSION: The correct personal protective equipment considering the occupational safety helps to sustainably protect personnel from infections. Reorganizational measures in the operating room are urgently indicated for potential aerosol-forming procedures in infected patients or patients with an unclear infection status.

At the end of March 2020, the first and so far largest outbreak of the disease occurred in a retirement home in Hamburg. METHODS: Analysis of procedures in dealing with a residential unit affected by SARS-CoV\u20112, accommodating a risk group of 60 seniors with dementia is presented as well as a detailed presentation of post-mortem examination results of all 8 deceased tested positive for SARS-CoV\u20112. RESULTS: Out of 60 residents, 39 were infected by SARS-CoV\u20112. Due to preventive procedures it was possible to stop further spreading of the infection to other residential areas. In all 8 fatal cases, the autopsy diagnosis was death due to COVID-19. Autopsies revealed all COVID-19 patients to have a fatal (broncho)pneumonia and signs of relevant pre-existing cardiac, renal and pulmonary conditions in all cases. In 75% (n = 6) of the cases a fresh venous thrombosis was found. In 66.7% (n = 4) of the cases thrombotic events were combined with peripheral pulmonary artery thromboembolisms. CONCLUSION: The cohort of SARS-CoV\u20112 infected residents of a nursing home is characteristic for clinical and epidemiological features of the new coronavirus disease. Due to a centralized evaluation of all fatalities at the Institute of Legal Medicine in Hamburg, a detailed examination of all deceased positive for SARS-CoV\u20112 was possible. Thereby, increased case fatality rates of approximately 20% could in all cases be assigned to a relevant number of pre-existing comorbidities of multiple organ systems, which was consistent with the clinical data available.","publish_time":1593907200000,"author_summary":" Klein, A.; Edler, C.; Fitzek, A.; Fr\u00f6b, D.;<br>Heinemann, A.; Mei\u00dfner, K.; Mushumba, H.; P\u00fcschel, K.;<br>Schr\u00f6der, A.

But three of these viruses cause more serious, acute diseases; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS by MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) by SARS-CoV and COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2. The current outbreak was classified by the WHO as a \u201cglobal public health emergency\u201d. Despite all efforts to reduce the surgical lists and to cancel or postpone non-time-critical surgical interventions, some surgical and anesthetic interventions outside of intensive care medicine are still necessary and must be performed. This is particularly true for obstetric interventions and neuraxial labor analgesia. Workload in the delivery room is presumably not going to decrease and planned cesarean sections cannot be postponed. In the meantime, the clinical course and outcome of some COVID-19 patients with an existing pregnancy or peripartum courses have been reported. There are already numerous recommendations from national and international bodies regarding the care of such patients. Some of these recommendations will be summarized in this manuscript. The selection of aspects should by no means be seen as a form of prioritization. The general treatment principles in dealing with COVID-19 patients and the recommendations for action in intensive care therapy also apply to pregnant and postpartum patients. In this respect, there are naturally considerable redundancies and only a few aspects apply strictly or exclusively to the cohort of obstetric patients. In summary, at present it must be stated that the general care recommendations that also apply to non-COVID-19 patients are initially valid with regard to obstetric anesthesia. Nevertheless, the special requirements on the part of hygiene and infection protection result in special circumstances that should be taken into account when caring for pregnant patients from an anesthetic point of view. These relate to both medical aspects, but also to a particular extent logistics issues with regard to spatial separation, staffing and material resources.","publish_time":1586390400000,"author_summary":" Kranke, Peter; Weibel, Stephanie; Sitter,<br>Magdalena; Meybohm, Patrick; Girard, Thierry","abstract_summary":" The most common human corona viruses cause<br>common colds.

ABSTRACT Objectives: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused major sanitary crisis worldwide. Half of the world has been placed in quarantine. In France, this large-scale health crisis urgently triggered the restructuring and reorganization of health service delivery to support emergency services, medical intensive care units and continuing care units. Health professionals mobilized all their resources to provide emergency aid in a general climate of uncertainty. Concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising. The goal of the present article is to provide an up-to-date information on potential mental health risks associated with exposure of health professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature considering previous epidemics of 2003 (SARS-CoV-1) and 2009 (H1N1) with the more recent data about the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlighted most relevant data concerning the disease characteristics, the organizational factors and personal factors that may contribute to developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. Results: The disease characteristics of the current COVID-19 pandemic provoked a generalized climate of wariness and uncertainty, particularly among health professionals, due to a range of causes such as the rapid spread of COVID-19, the severity of symptoms it can cause in a segment of infected individuals, the lack of knowledge of the disease, and deaths among health professionals. Stress may also be caused by organizational factors, such as depletion of personal protection equipment, concern about not being able to provide competent care if deployed to new area, concern about rapidly changing information, lack of access to up-to-date information and communication, lack of specific drugs, the shortage of ventilators and intensive care unit beds necessary to care for the surge of critically ill patients, and significant change in their daily social and family life. Further risk factors have been identified, including feelings of being inadequately supported, concerns about health of self, fear of taking home infection to family members or others, and not having rapid access to testing through occupational health if needed, being isolated, feelings of uncertainty and social stigmatization, overwhelming workload, or insecure attachment. Additionally, we discussed positive social and organizational factors that contribute to enhance resilience in the face of the pandemic. There is a consensus in all the relevant literature that health care professionals are at an increased risk of high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder, which could have long-term psychological implications. Conclusions: In the long run, this tragic health crisis should significantly enhance our understanding of the mental health risk factors among the health care professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporting information such as this is essential to plan future prevention strategies. Protecting health care professionals is indeed an important component of public health measures to address large-scale health crisis. Thus, interventions to promote mental well-being in health care professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented, and to strengthen prevention and response strategies by training health care professionals on mental help and crisis management.","publish_time":1587513600000,"author_summary":" El-Hage, Wissam; Hingray, Coraline; Lemogne,<br>C\u00e9dric; Yrondi, Antoine; Brunault, Paul; Bienvenu,<br>Thomas; Etain, Bruno; Paquet, Claire; Gohier,<br>B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte; Bennabi, Djamila; Birmes, Philippe;<br>Sauvaget, Anne; Fakra, Eric; Prieto, Nathalie; Bulteau,<br>Samuel; Vidailhet, Pierre; Jollant, Fabrice; Camus,<br>Vincent; Leboyer, Marion; Krebs, Marie-Odile;<br>Aouizerate, Bruno","abstract_summary":" R\u00c9SUM\u00c9 Objectifs: La pand\u00e9mie de la maladie \u00e0<br>coronavirus (COVID-19) a provoqu\u00e9 une crise sanitaire<br>majeure et mis en quarantaine la moiti\u00e9 de la population<br>plan\u00e9taire.
