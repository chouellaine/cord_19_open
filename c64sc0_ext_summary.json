{"cluster": 64, "subcluster": 0, "abstract_summ": "Using the recently published crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexed with the human host cell receptor ACE2, we characterized the structure and evolution of ACE2 in several of these species and identify a single interacting amino acid residue conserved between human and Felidae ACE2 but not in Canidae that correlates with virus susceptibility.The contact surface of ACE2 displays amino acid residues that are critical for virus recognition, and variations at these critical residues are likely to modulate infection susceptibility across species.To characterize potential functional variation in savanna monkey ACE2 and TMPRSS2, we inspected recently published genomic data from 245 savanna monkeys, including 163 wild monkeys from Africa and the Caribbean and 82 captive monkeys from the Vervet Research Colony (VRC).The virus engages the host cell receptor, angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme\u20102 (ACE2), through the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein.Both ACE2 (an entry receptor) and TMPRSS2 (used by the virus for spike protein priming) are key proteins to SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, enabling progression to COVID-19 in humans.", "title_summ": "Comparative ACE2 variation and primate COVID-19 riskInsights on cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from structural modelingLions, Tigers and Kittens too: ACE2 and susceptibility to CoVID-19ACE2 and TMPRSS2 variation in savanna monkeys (Chlorocebus spp.): Potential risk for zoonotic/anthroponotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and a potential model for functional studies", "title_abstract_phrases": "To characterize potential functional variation in savanna monkey ACE2 and TMPRSS2, we inspected recently published genomic data from 245 savanna monkeys, including 163 wild monkeys from Africa and the Caribbean and 82 captive monkeys from the Vervet Research Colony (VRC).Using the recently published crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexed with the human host cell receptor ACE2, we characterized the structure and evolution of ACE2 in several of these species and identify a single interacting amino acid residue conserved between human and Felidae ACE2 but not in Canidae that correlates with virus susceptibility.The contact surface of ACE2 displays amino acid residues that are critical for virus recognition, and variations at these critical residues are likely to modulate infection susceptibility across species.The virus engages the host cell receptor, angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme\u20102 (ACE2), through the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein.Comparative genomic research into critical ACE2 binding sites, associated with the spike receptor binding domain, has suggested that African and Asian primates may also be susceptible to disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection."}
