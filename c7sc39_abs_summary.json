{"cluster": 7, "subcluster": 39, "abstract_summ": " In the realm of term rewriting, given terms s and t, a reachability condition is called feasible if there is a substitution [Formula: see text] in zero or more steps; otherwise, it is called infeasible . In this paper, we generalize this notion of feasibility to arbitrary n-ary relations on terms defined by first-order theories . We introduce a framework for proving feasibility/infeasibility, and a tool, infChecker, which implements it ."}
