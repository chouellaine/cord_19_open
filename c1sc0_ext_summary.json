{"cluster": 1, "subcluster": 0, "abstract_summ": "We investigated whether chimpanzees show the expert effect and how humans and chimpanzees differ by testing chimpanzees (human experts) with human body stimuli and testing humans (chimpanzee experts) with chimpanzee and human body stimuli in body recognition tasks.The main finding was that humans (chimpanzee experts) showed the expert effect to chimpanzee bodies, while chimpanzees partially showed it to human bodies.After reviewing some main aims and models of psychology, and comparing them with those of other sciences, the commentary deals with the possibility of simulating life as a tool for building evolutionary psychological models.These results provide evidence that chimpanzees, like humans, may be vulnerable to misinformation effects, even when that misleading information is presented in a different modality (video) than the original live event memory, demonstrating further commonality between human and ape memory systems.This hybrid of review and personal essay argues that models of visual construction are essential to extend spatial navigation models to models that link episodic memory and imagination.", "title_summ": "From Probability to Consilience: How Explanatory Values Implement Bayesian ReasoningFrom spatial navigation via visual construction to episodic memory and imaginationTruthful but Misleading: Advanced Linguistic Strategies for Lying Among ChildrenMaking Sense of the World: Infant Learning From a Predictive Processing PerspectiveThe Fuzzy Processing of MetaphorsPerception and RealityComputational Science vs. ZombiesExploring the Role of Perspective Taking in Educational Child-Robot InteractionTowards the Role of Theory of Mind in ExplanationSearching for Models for Psychological Science: A Possible Contribution of Simulation.Familiarity with humans affect dogs' tendencies to follow human majority groups.Post-event misinformation effects in a language-trained chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes).Body perception in chimpanzees and humans: The expert effect.", "title_abstract_phrases": "The main finding was that humans (chimpanzee experts) showed the expert effect to chimpanzee bodies, while chimpanzees partially showed it to human bodies.We investigated whether chimpanzees show the expert effect and how humans and chimpanzees differ by testing chimpanzees (human experts) with human body stimuli and testing humans (chimpanzee experts) with chimpanzee and human body stimuli in body recognition tasks.These results provide evidence that chimpanzees, like humans, may be vulnerable to misinformation effects, even when that misleading information is presented in a different modality (video) than the original live event memory, demonstrating further commonality between human and ape memory systems.Post-event misinformation effects in a language-trained chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes).Errors of source monitoring are widespread human memory challenges, and our memories are subject to distortion upon the presentation of subsequent misinformation.We also tested humans that were not chimpanzee experts using chimpanzee body stimuli."}
