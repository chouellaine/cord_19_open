The complex structure reveals that the partial double-stranded RNA template is inserted into the central channel of the RdRp where Remdesivir is incorporated into the first replicated base pair and terminates the chain elongation.Moreover, we found that some bismuth salts could effectively inhibit both the NTPase and RNA helicase activities of SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 in a dose-dependent manner.", "title_summ": "Structural basis of RNA recognition by the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphoproteinStructural Basis for the Inhibition of the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase from SARS-CoV-2 by RemdesivirStructural basis for inhibition of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from SARS-CoV-2 by remdesivirA Structural View of SARS-CoV-2 RNA Replication Machinery: RNA Synthesis, Proofreading and Final CappingSARS-Coronavirus-2 Nsp13 Possesses NTPase and RNA Helicase Activities That Can Be Inhibited by Bismuth Salts", "title_abstract_phrases": "For RNA viruses, virus-encoded RNA helicases have long been recognized to play pivotal roles during viral life cycles by facilitating the correct folding and replication of viral RNAs.Here, our studies show that SARS-CoV-2-encoded nonstructural protein 13 (nsp13) possesses the nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase (NTPase) and RNA helicase activities that can hydrolyze all types of NTPs and unwind RNA helices dependently of the presence of NTP, and further characterize the biochemical characteristics of these two enzymatic activities associated with SARS-CoV-2 nsp13.Here we report the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp either in the apo form or in complex with a 50-base template-primer RNA and Remdesivir at a resolution range of 2.5-2.8 \u00c5.
