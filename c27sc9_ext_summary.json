In this study, the partial ORF1a, spike protein (S) and nucleocapsid protein (N) were sequenced from Shandong Province between 2017 and 2018.Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that four strains shared 98.2%-98.4% nucleotide identity with CHN-AH-2004 and were classified into a new cluster of China lineage strains, whereas the CHN-GX81-2018 strain shared 98.7% nucleotide identity with Vietnam/Binh21/2015 and belonged to the Vietnam/Laos/Thailand lineage.", "title_summ": "Experiments Investigating the Competitive Growth Advantage of Two Different Genotypes of Human Metapneumovirus: Implications for the Alternation of Genotype PrevalenceMolecular epidemiology and genetic variation analyses of porcine circovirus type 2 isolated from Yunnan Province in China from 2016-2019Sequence analysis of the first B5 subgenogroup strain of enterovirus 71 isolated in KoreaFull-genome sequences of GII.13[P21] recombinant norovirus strains from an outbreak in Changsha, ChinaEmergence of Thailand-like strains of porcine deltacoronavirus in Guangxi Province, China.Genetic, antigenic and pathogenic characterization of avian coronaviruses isolated from pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) in ChinaGenetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in Shandong Province, China", "title_abstract_phrases": "The sequencing results for the S protein from 10 PDCoV strains showed 96.7 %\u201399.7 % nucleotide sequence identity with the China lineage strains, while sharing a lower level of nucleotide sequence identity, ranging from 95.7 to 96.8%, with the Vietnam/Laos/Thailand lineage strains.All strains shared 94.3\u201399.9% of their identities with the nucleotide sequences of complete genomes in this study and shared 94.2\u201399.9% identity with the reference sequences.Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that four strains shared 98.2%-98.4% nucleotide identity with CHN-AH-2004 and were classified into a new cluster of China lineage strains, whereas the CHN-GX81-2018 strain shared 98.7% nucleotide identity with Vietnam/Binh21/2015 and belonged to the Vietnam/Laos/Thailand lineage.In particular, CMC718 demonstrated maximum identity with strain M988 of the B5 genotype and numerous amino acid variants were detected in the 3D domain of the viral protein P3, which is consistent with the mutation pattern of a B5 strain isolated in 2012\u20132013.Our study was a full-genome sequence analysis of the first EV71 strain of the B5 genotype isolated in South Korea."}
