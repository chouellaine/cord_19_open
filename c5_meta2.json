An efficient computational model based on the standard k-e model is established to solve these problems. The coefficients in the dissipative equation are modified to compensate the enlarged numerical dissipation caused by coarse grid; meanwhile, the piecewise-defined turbulent viscosity is introduced to combine the forced and natural convection. The modified model is validated by available experimental results in a Boeing 737-200 mock-up. Furthermore, the unsteady characteristic of the aircraft cabin environment is obtained and analyzed. According to the frequency analysis, it turns out that the thermal plume is the main factor of the unsteady fluctuation in cabin.

In the classical version, the fine solver has a fixed high accuracy which is the major obstacle to achieve a competitive parallel efficiency. In this paper, we develop an adaptive variant that overcomes this obstacle by dynamically increasing the accuracy of the fine solver across the parareal iterations. We theoretically show that the parallel efficiency becomes very competitive in the ideal case where the cost of the coarse solver is small, thus proving that the only remaining factors impeding full scalability become the cost of the coarse solver and communication time. The developed theory has also the merit of setting a general framework to understand the success of several extensions of parareal based on iteratively improving the quality of the fine solver and re-using information from previous parareal steps.

The inclusion of NURBS curves into the mathematical formalism of the parametric integral equations system method (PIES) is proposed. The advantages of such an application are widely discussed. Recently, the Bezier curves, mainly the cubic curves (of third-degree), were used. The segments of the boundary shape were modeled by such curves (with ensuring continuity at the connection points). Using NURBS curves, the boundary shape can be modeled with only one curve. So, continuity is automatically ensured. Additionally, the second degree NURBS curve is enough to obtain the shape with high accuracy (better than cubic Bezier curves). The NURBS curve is defined by points, their weights and knots vector. Such parameters significantly improve the shape modification process, which can directly improve e.g. the shape identification process. To examine the impact of modeling accuracy on the final PIES solutions, examples described by the Navier-Lam\u00e9 equations were used. To improve calculations, the PIES method using NURBS curves was implemented as a computer program. Then, it was decided to verify the accuracy of the obtained solutions. For comparison, the solutions were also obtained using analytical solutions, boundary element method, and PIES method (with the Bezier curves). An improvement in the boundary shape modeling was noticed. It significantly affects the accuracy of solutions. As a result, the consumption of computer resources was reduced, while the process of boundary shape modeling and the accuracy of the obtained results were improved.","publish_time":1592179200000,"author_summary":" Kapturczak, Marta; Zieniuk, Eugeniusz;<br>Ku\u017celewski, Andrzej","abstract_summary":" This paper presents a way to improve the<br>boundary shape modeling process in solving boundary<br>value problems in elasticity.

In order to apply the present method to models with various shapes on the Cartesian grid, the seamless immersed boundary method (SIBM) is used. Normally, when the SIBM is applied to a deformed object, the velocity condition on the boundary is imposed by the moving velocity of the boundary. In the present method, the velocity condition is imposed by zero velocity even if the object is deformed because the purpose of the present morphing simulation is to obtain simulation results for a stationary object. In order to verify the present method, two-dimensional simulations for the flow around an object were performed. In order to obtain drag coefficients of multiple models, the object was deformed in turn from the initial model to each model in the present morphing simulation.

If the data domain is formed by scattered data, approximation methods may become very complicated as well as time-consuming. Usually, the given data is tessellated by some method, not necessarily the Delaunay triangulation, to produce triangular or tetrahedral meshes. After that approximation methods can be used to produce the surface. However, it is difficult to ensure the continuity and smoothness of the final interpolant along with all adjacent triangles. In this contribution, a meshless approach is proposed by using radial basis functions (RBFs). It is applicable to explicit functions of two variables and it is suitable for all types of scattered data in general. The key point for the RBF approximation is finding the important points that give a good approximation with high precision to the scattered data. Since the compactly supported RBFs (CSRBF) has limited influence in numerical computation, large data sets can be processed efficiently as well as very fast via some efficient algorithm. The main advantage of the RBF is, that it leads to a solution of a system of linear equations (SLE) Ax = b. Thus any efficient method solves the systems of linear equations that can be used.

The uncertainties in these coefficients are then evaluated using the Bayesian inference approach. For both of the cases, a uniform prior distribution is used.

A key unknown in simulating secondary breakup in turbulent multiphase jets is the inflow size distribution generated within the primary breakup zone near the nozzle exit. A mono-disperse injection inflow condition is commonly used for simplicity, but this choice is often unrealistic. In order to provide more realistic inlet conditions for LES, we develop a one dimensional (1D) parcel model to predict the evolution of the dispersed phase along the jet centerline due to the combined effects of advection, radial turbulent transport and droplet breakup due to turbulence in the regions closer to the jet nozzle that cannot be resolved using coarse LES. The model is validated with experimental data measured far from the nozzle. The 1D model is also used to generate an initial size distribution for use in a coarse-resolution LES of a turbulent jet. Number density fields for each bin of the discretized droplet size distribution are modeled using an Eulerian LES approach and scalar transport equations are solved for each bin. LES results are compared to published experimental data, with good agreement and we examine the statistics of the velocity field and the concentration of the polydisperse oil droplet plumes for two droplet Weber numbers. We find that the centerline decay rate of the concentration for different droplet sizes is modified in the breakup dominated zone.

The rough-path variational approach includes non-Markovian perturbations of the Lagrangian fluid trajectories. In particular, memory effects can be introduced through this formulation through a judicious choice of the rough path (e.g. a realization of a fractional Brownian motion). In the special case when the rough path is a realization of a semimartingale, we recover the SGFD models in Holm (2015). However, by eliminating the need for stochastic variational tools, we retain a pathwise interpretation of the Lagrangian trajectories.

The reason why this further step requested a short time to be elaborated is due to recognising that previous work by the Authors had actually already solved the related problems, though in a slightly different way, now interpreted in a more significant frame owing to a better problem understanding. The present similarity theory is based on first ideas developed more than one and a half decade ago by one of the authors, while addressing flow stability of supercritical fluids in heated channels, which encountered immediate problems to be applied in a straightforward way to heat transfer. These ideas were revised and considerably improved during the PhD thesis of the other author, also overcoming a sort of prejudicial assumption that finally resulted to limit their applicability. More recently, published DNS data triggered further reflections on the role of the Prandtl number, leading to the mentioned \u201clocal\u201d form of the successful similarity theory. This led to the present step, by just recognising that the mentioned PhD thesis had already proposed a sufficient rationale to extend this local interpretation to a broader range of conditions. The rather convincing results presented herein, obtained making use of RANS CFD analyses with four different fluids, demonstrate the interesting capabilities of this final form of the theory. The establishment of an effective set of dimensionless numbers for heat transfer problems is hoped to pave the way for the development of the still lacking successful engineering heat transfer correlations for supercritical pressure fluids.
