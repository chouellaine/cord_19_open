Background: The aims of this study are to investigate the COVID-19 status of patients with initial sudden olfactory anosmia (ISOA) using nasopharyngeal swabs for RT-PCR analysis and to explore their olfactory dysfunctions with psychophysical olfactory evaluation.METHODS: An online survey was conducted by the Brazilian Society of Otorhinolaryngology and Cervico-Facial Surgery, and Brazilian Academy of Rhinology, including doctors who assessed sudden olfactory dysfunction patients starting after February 1(st), 2020.RESULTS: 253 sudden olfactory dysfunction patients were included, of which 59.1% were females with median age of 36 years, with a median follow-up period of 31 days.Twenty-two (23.91%) patients complained of olfactory loss and in 6 (6.52%) patients olfactory loss was
