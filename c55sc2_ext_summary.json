we translate insights from our study of routine coordination in the Ebola virus disease response operation by Uganda Red Cross Society (URCS) for managing long-lasting public health emergencies.Alliances between the government and academic communities can be a key component of the public health response to an emergency such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.For the COVID-19 pandemic, and for future pandemics, public health authorities at the local, state, and national levels must develop, deploy, and routinely disseminate, in as timely a manner as possible, a standard set of metrics that are goal-aligned with the public health response and that enable collective action by the whole of society, including the general public.The COVID-19 health system response of this country demonstrates that although developing countries face many health system challenges, political will, evidence-informed decision-making, respect for science, and timely, coordinated, collaborative actions can strengthen the resilience and response of the health system during a health emergency.CONCLUSIONS: Data and web-based approaches in response to a public health crisis are key to evidence-driven oversight and management of public health emergencies."}
