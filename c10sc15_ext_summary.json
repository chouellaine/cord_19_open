study aimed to automatically detect COVID-19 pneumonia patients using digital chest x-ray images while maximizing the accuracy in detection using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN).To this purpose, a publicly available dataset of 8,474 chest X-ray images is used, which includes 415 confirmed COVID-19 infected pneumonia, 5,179 community-acquired pneumonia, and 2,880 non-pneumonia cases.While the achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a larger set of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy rates.", "title_summ": "An
