{"cluster": 64, "subcluster": 12, "abstract_summ": " The glycoprotein spike (S) on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 is a determinant for viral invasion and host immune response . Herein, we report the glycosylation mapping on spike protein subunits S1 and S2 expressed on human cells . The elucidation of the glycan repertoire on the spike protein provides insights into the viral binding studies and more importantly, propels research towards the development of a suitable vaccine candidate ."}
