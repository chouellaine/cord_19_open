{"cluster": 10, "subcluster": 0, "abstract_summ": " Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) techniques and tractography techniques provide a representation of the anatomical connections in the white matter . The literature on methods for aligning tractograms is in active development . In this work, we align streamlines using the linear assignment problem (LAP) and propose a method to reduce the high computational cost of aligning whole brain tractograms . We show that a main limitation of all streamline-based nonlinear registration methods is the computational cost ."}
