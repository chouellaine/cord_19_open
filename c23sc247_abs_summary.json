{"cluster": 23, "subcluster": 247, "abstract_summ": " We present a simple but realistic model for describing the diffusion of an infectious disease on a population of individuals . The dynamics is governed by a single functional delay differential equation, which, in the case of a large population, can be solved exactly, even in the presence of a time-dependent infection rate . We apply our model to describe the outbreak of the new virus COVID-19 in Italy, taking into account the containment measures implemented by the government to mitigate the spreading of the virus ."}
