To fight this threat, actors from both research and industry are constantly innovating to bring concrete solutions to improve security and malware protection. Traditional solutions such as signature-based anti viruses have shown their limits in front of massive proliferation of new malware, which are most often only variants specifically designed to bypass signature-based detection. Accordingly, it paves the way to the emergence of new approaches based on Machine Learning (ML) technics to boost the detection of unknown malware variants. Unfortunately, these solutions are most often underexploited due to the time and resource costs required to adequately fine tune machine learning algorithms. In reality, in the Android community, state-of-the-art studies do not focus on model training, and most often go through an empirical study with a manual process to choose the learning strategy, and\/or use default values as parameters to configure ML algorithms. However, in the ML domain, it is well known admitted that to solve efficiently a ML problem, the tunability of hyper-parameters is of the utmost importance. Nevertheless, as soon as the targeted ML problem involves a massive amount of data, there is a strong tension between feasibility of exploring all combinations and accuracy. This tension imposes to automate the search for optimal hyper-parameters applied to ML algorithms, that is not anymore possible to achieve manually. To this end, we propose a generic and scalable solution to automatically both configure and evaluate ML algorithms to efficiently detect Android malware detection systems. Our approach is based on devOps principles and a microservice architecture deployed over a set of nodes to scale and exhaustively test a large number of ML algorithms and hyper-parameters combinations.

ZeroNet, called an open, free and robust network, has attracted a rising number of users. Most of P2P networks are applied into file-sharing systems or data-storage system and the characteristics of these networks are widely investigated. However, there are obvious differences between ZeroNet and conventional P2P networks. Existing researches rarely involve ZeroNet and the characteristics and robustness of ZeroNet are unknown. To tackle the aforementioned problem, the present study measures the ZeroNet peer resources and site resources separately, and at the same time, proposes collection methods for both. No like other simulation experiments, the experiments of this paper are set on real-world environment. This is also the first measurement study about ZeroNet. Experimental results show that the topology of the peer network in ZeroNet has scarce edges, short distances and low clustering coefficients, and its degree distribution exhibits a special distribution. These indicate that the peer network of ZeroNet has poor robustness and the experimental results of the ZeroNet resilience verify this issue. In addition, this paper represents an improved peer exchange method to enhance the robustness of the ZeroNet. We also measure the topology characteristics, languages, sizes and versions of the sites in ZeroNet.

In this paper, we present Ringer, a scalable method to detect malicious domains by dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Ringer first uses querying behaviors or domain-IP resolutions to construct domain graphs, on which the dynamic GCN is leveraged to learn the node representations that integrate both information about node features and graph structure. And then, these high-quality representations are further fed to the full-connected neural network for domain classification. Notably, instead of global statically learning, we adopt time-based hash to cut graphs to small ones and inductively learn the embedding of nodes according to selectively sampling neighbors. We construct a series of experiments on a large ISP over two days and compare it with state of the arts. The results demonstrate that Ringer achieves excellent performance with a high accuracy of 96.8% on average.

Key performance indicators at the application level are throughput, download time, round trip time, and video delay.

Moreover, they must meet the objectives of economic sustainability. Today, Telco operators rarely achieve the above objectives, mainly due to the push to increase the bit-rate of access networks without considering the end-to-end KPIs of the applications. The main contribution of this paper concerns the definition of a deployment framework to address performance and cost issues for VHC networks. We show three actions on which it is necessary to focus. First, limiting bit-rate through video compression. Second, contain the rate of packet loss through artificial intelligence algorithms for line stabilization. Third, reduce latency (i.e., round-trip time) with edge-cloud computing. The concerted and gradual application of these measures can allow a Telco to get out of the ultra-broadband\"trap\"of the access network, as defined in the paper. We propose to work on end-to-end optimization of the bandwidth utilization ratio. This leads to a better performance experienced by the end-user.

Decision-making acknowledges periodical reports of QoE from the clients to assess the video streaming from each fog node. These values serve as inputs for a real-time Analytic Hierarchy Process method to compute the influence factor for each parameter and compute the QoE improvement potential of the fog node. Fog4Video is executed in fog nodes organized in multiple tiers, having different characteristics to provide VoD services.
