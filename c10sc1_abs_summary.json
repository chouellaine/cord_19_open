{"cluster": 10, "subcluster": 1, "abstract_summ": " Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have proven effective in solving the task of semantic segmentation . But efficiency heavily relies on pixel-level annotations that are expensive to get and often require domain expertise, especially in medical imaging . We show that this approach is applicable to chest X-rays for detecting an anomalous volume of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall ."}
