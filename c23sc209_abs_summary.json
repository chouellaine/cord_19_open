{"cluster": 23, "subcluster": 209, "abstract_summ": " Using data through April 20, 2020, we fit a statistical model to COVID-19 case fatality rates over time at the US county level . The IFR-S in the US was estimated to be 1.3% (95% central credible interval: 0.6% to 2.1%) County-specific rates varied from 0.5% to 3.6%. The overall IFR for COVID .19 should be lower when we account for cases that remain and recover without symptoms . Substantial variation across patient demographics likely exists ."}
