The time dependent Vaidya metric which represents the spacetime of a radiating body like star is studied in an energy dependent gravity's rainbow, which is a UV completion of General Relativity. In our quest we have used gravitational collapse as the main tool. The focus is to probe the nature of singularity (black hole or naked singularity) formed out of the collapsing procedure. This is achieved via a geodesic study. For our investigation we have considered two different models of [Formula: see text] gravity, namely the inflationary Starobinsky's model and the power law model. Our study reveals the fact that naked singularity is as good a possibility as black hole as far as the central singularity is concerned. Via a proper fine tuning of the initial data, we may realize both black hole or naked singularity as the end state of the collapse. Thus this study is extremely important and relevant in the light of the Cosmic Censorship hypothesis. The most important result derived from the study is that gravity's rainbow increases the tendency of formation of naked singularities. We have also deduced the conditions under which the singularity will be a strong or weak curvature singularity. Finally in our quest to know more about the model we have performed a thermodynamical study. Throughout the study we have obtained results which involve deviation from the classical set-up. Such deviations are expected in a quantum evolution and can be attributed to the quantum fluctuations that our model suffers from. It is expected that this study will enhance our knowledge about quantization of gravity and subsequently about the illusive theory of quantum gravity.","publish_time":1586476800000,"author_summary":" Rudra, Prabir","abstract_summary":" In this note we explore a non-static spacetime<br>in quantum regime in the background of [Formula:<br>see text] gravity.

Analogous to the gravity field, magnetic field modeling can be expanded by magnetic curvatures (MC), the third-order derivatives of the magnetic potential (MP), which are the change rates of the magnetic gradient tensor (MGT).

Based on the magnetic effects of a uniform spherical shell, all expressions for the MP, magnetic vector (MV), MGT and MC of tesseroids have been examined for numerical problems due to singularity of the respective integral kernels (i.e., near zone and polar singularity problems). For this, the closed analytical expressions for the MP, MV, MGT and MC of the uniform spherical shell have been provided and used to generate singularity-free reference values. Varying both height and latitude of the computation point, it is found numerically that the near zone problem also exists for all magnetic quantities (i.e., MP, MV, MGT and MC). The numerical tests also reveal that the polar singularity problems do not occur for the magnetic quantity as a result of the use of Cartesian as opposed to spherical integral kernels. This demonstrates that the magnetic quantity including the newly derived MC \u2018inherit\u2019 the same numerical properties as the corresponding gravitational functional.

The gravitational-wave signal, GW190814, was observed during LIGO's and Virgo's third observing run on August 14, 2019 at 21:10:39 UTC and has a signal-to-noise ratio of 25 in the three-detector network. The source was localized to 18.5 deg$^2$ at a distance of $241^{+41}_{-45}$ Mpc; no electromagnetic counterpart has been confirmed to date. The source has the most unequal mass ratio yet measured with gravitational waves, $0.112^{+0.008}_{-0.009}$, and its secondary component is either the lightest black hole or the heaviest neutron star ever discovered in a double compact-object system. The dimensionless spin of the primary black hole is tightly constrained to $\\leq 0.07$. Tests of general relativity reveal no measurable deviations from the theory, and its prediction of higher-multipole emission is confirmed at high confidence. We estimate a merger rate density of 1-23 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the new class of binary coalescence sources that GW190814 represents. Astrophysical models predict that binaries with mass ratios similar to this event can form through several channels, but are unlikely to have formed in globular clusters. However, the combination of mass ratio, component masses, and the inferred merger rate for this event challenges all current models for the formation and mass distribution of compact-object binaries.","publish_time":1592784000000,"author_summary":" Collaboration, The LIGO Scientific; Abbott,<br>the Virgo Collaboration R.; Abbott, T.

We did not detect any electromagnetic counterparts to the gravitational-wave candidates during O3, likely due to the very large localisation areas (on average thousands of degrees squares) and relatively large distance of the candidates (above 200 Mpc for 60 % of BNS candidates).

Such challenges can be potentially resolved if a rapidly-rotating Wolf-Rayet star is located at the heart of the system, implicating Apep as a Galactic progenitor system to long-duration gamma-ray bursts. One of the difficulties in interpreting the dynamics of Apep is that the spectral composition of the stars in the system was unclear. Here we present visual to near-infrared spectra that demonstrate that the central component of Apep is composed of two classical Wolf-Rayet stars of carbon- (WC8) and nitrogen-sequence (WN4-6b) subtypes. We argue that such an assignment represents the strongest case of a classical WR+WR binary system in the Milky Way. The terminal line-of-sight wind velocities of the WC8 and WN4-6b stars are measured to be $2100 \\pm 200$ and $3500 \\pm 100$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. If the mass-loss rate of the two stars are typical for their spectral class, the momentum ratio of the colliding winds is expected to be $\\approx$ 0.4. Since the expansion velocity of the dust plume is significantly smaller than either of the measured terminal velocities, we explore the suggestion that one of the Wolf-Rayet winds is anisotropic. We can recover a shock-compressed wind velocity consistent with the observed dust expansion velocity if the WC8 star produces a significantly slow equatorial wind with a velocity of $\\approx$530 km s$^{-1}$. Such slow wind speeds can be driven by near-critical rotation of a Wolf-Rayet star.","publish_time":1588291200000,"author_summary":" Callingham, J. R.; Crowther, P. A.; Williams,<br>P.

We limit this study to exoplanets and BDs with orbits that have semi-major axis of 1AU0.25, and having a parent star of mass M>1Mo. We find that the star HIP 75458 will engulf its planet HIP 75458 b during its RGB phase. The planet will remove the envelope and terminate the RGB evolution, leaving a bare helium core of mass 0.4Mo that will evolve to form a helium white dwarf. Only in one system out of five, the planet beta Pic c will enter the envelope of its parent star during the AGB phase.

Another shows both the narrow C II emission lines characteristic of a [WC11], but also broad emission of C IV, O V, and He II characteristic of a much hotter [WC4] star; we speculate that this is a binary [WC]. The third object shows weak C II emission, but the spectrum is dominated by a dense thicket of strong absorption lines, including numerous O II transitions. We conclude it is likely an unusual hot, hydrogen-poor post-AGB star, possibly in transition from [WC] to white dwarf. Even lacking a complete spectroscopic program, we can infer that late [WC] stars do not dominate the central stars of LMC planetary nebulae, and that the detected C II emitters are largely of an old population.","publish_time":1591574400000,"author_summary":" Margon, Bruce; Massey, Philip; Neugent,<br>Kathryn F.; Morrell, Nidia","abstract_summary":" We present a narrow-band imaging survey of the<br>Large Magellanic Cloud, designed to isolate the C II<br>$\\lambda\\lambda$7231, 7236 emission lines in objects as faint as<br>$m_{\\lambda7400}\\sim18$.

Using post-processing Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations of ionizing radiation, we compute f_esc from cluster stars and non-cluster stars formed during a starburst over ~100 Myr in each galaxy. We find that the averaged f_esc over the lifetime of a star particle follows a similar distribution for cluster stars and non-cluster stars. Clusters tend to have low f_esc in the first few Myrs, presumably because they form preferentially in more extreme environments with high optical depths; the f_esc increases later as feedback starts to disrupt the natal cloud. On the other hand, non-cluster stars formed between cluster complexes or in the compressed shell at the front of a superbubble can also have high f_esc. We find that cluster stars on average have comparable f_esc to non-cluster stars. This result is robust across several star formation models in our simulations. Our results suggest that the fraction of ionizing photons from proto-GCs to cosmic reionization is comparable to the cluster formation efficiency in high-redshift galaxies and hence proto-GCs likely contribute an appreciable fraction of photons but are not the dominant sources for reionization.","publish_time":1592352000000,"author_summary":" Ma, Xiangcheng; Quataert, Eliot; Wetzel,<br>Andrew; Faucher-Giguere, Claude-Andr'e;<br>Boylan-Kolchin, Michael","abstract_summary":" We study the escape fraction of ionizing<br>photons (f_esc) in two cosmological zoom-in<br>simulations of galaxies in the reionization era with halo<br>mass M_halo~10^10 and 10^11 M_sun (stellar mass<br>M*~10^7 and 10^9 M_sun) at z=5 from the Feedback in<br>Realistic Environments project.

Therefore this representation allows us to study directly the necessary conditions for a classical universe to emerge from a quantum state. In the previous study on the de Sitter universe this was done by comparing the classical limit of the quantum tomograms with the tomograms resulting from the classical cosmological equations. In this paper we first review these results and extend them to all the de Sitter models. We show further that these tomograms can be obtained directly from transposing the Wheeler-De Witt equation to the tomographic variables. Subsequently, because the classic limits of the quantum tomograms are identified with their asymptotic expressions, we found the necessary conditions to extend the previous results by taking the tomograms of the WKB solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation with a any potential. Furthermore in the previous works we found that the de Sitter models undergo the quantum-to-classical transition when the cosmological constant decays to its present value, we discuss at the end how far we can extend this result to more general models. In the conclusions, after discussing any improvements and developments of the results of this work, we sketch a phenomenological approach from which to extract information about the initial states of the universe.","publish_time":1594080000000,"author_summary":" Stornaiolo, Cosimo","abstract_summary":" Quantum and classical physical states are<br>represented in a unified way when they are described by<br>symplectic tomography.
