prepandemic candidate vaccine viruses in suspension MDCK cellsBACKGROUND: Influenza vaccine manufacturers traditionally use egg-derived candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) to produce high-yield influenza viruses for seasonal or pandemic vaccines; however, these egg-derived CVVs need an adaptation process for the virus to grow in mammalian cells.Optimizing Anti-Viral Vaccine Responses: Input from a
