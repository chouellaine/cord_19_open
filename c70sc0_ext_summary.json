{"cluster": 70, "subcluster": 0, "abstract_summ": "The authors aimed to introduce an appropriate treatment protocol for oropharyngeal bleeding that provides first aid to patients while protecting medical staff at high-risk of infection such as COVID-19.Unanticipated behaviours of the Airseal Insufflation and Access System (Conmed, NY, USA), in the public domain since 2017, have been recently restated by the manufacturer in light of the COVID19 pandemic and widespread concerns regarding aerosolization hazards during surgery.This approach is technically feasible and can minimize the risk of viral transmission during EVH.The COVID-19 pandemic has made it imperative to rapidly implement changes to typical medical practice in order to minimise spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated that operating room procedures be modified to ensure the safety of staff and patients.With the recognition that aerosol generating procedures are of particular importance to practice due to their high risk of virus transmission, we offer an additional tool for COVID-19 airway simulation training that helped consolidate learning and motivate change to practice in hospitals across Vancouver.We used a combination of assessment technologies in a high-fidelity simulation model (fresh porcine cadaver) as well as during clinical surgery to examine gas flow through the Airseal 12mm valve-less trocar with the Airseal IFS carbon dioxide (CO2 ) insufflator in Airseal mode.", "title_summ": "Comparison of the Effectiveness of Different Barrier Enclosure Techniques in Protection of Healthcare Workers During Tracheal Intubation and ExtubationSimple Device Design for Plume Management after Pneumoperitoneum in Laparoscopy in COVID-19 OutbreakImproved safety of endoscopic vessel harvesting during the COVID-19 pandemicThe use of UV fluorescent powder for COVID\u201019 airway management simulation trainingGas Aerosol Jetstreams from Trocars during Laparoscopic Surgery- A Video Vignette.Emergent procedures for oropharyngeal bleeding during the COVID-19 pandemic: Protection of medical staff.Laparoscopic Pneumoperitoneum Escape and Contamination during Surgery using the Airseal Insufflation System: Video Vignette.", "title_abstract_phrases": "This approach is technically feasible and can minimize the risk of viral transmission during EVH.The use of UV fluorescent powder for COVID\u201019 airway management simulation trainingThe COVID-19 pandemic has made it imperative to rapidly implement changes to typical medical practice in order to minimise spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated that operating room procedures be modified to ensure the safety of staff and patients.Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) procedures have been restricted during the COVID-19 pandemic, in part to reduce inpatient occupancy and minimize pressure on critical care and anaesthesia but also because of concern for the potential for transmission of infection via aerosols created by laparoscopy.With the recognition that aerosol generating procedures are of particular importance to practice due to their high risk of virus transmission, we offer an additional tool for COVID-19 airway simulation training that helped consolidate learning and motivate change to practice in hospitals across Vancouver.Emergent procedures for oropharyngeal bleeding during the COVID-19 pandemic: Protection of medical staff."}
