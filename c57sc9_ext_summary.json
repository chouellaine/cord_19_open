diagnosed PCR-positive for covid-19, received the hydroxychloroquine / azithromycin combination between March 27 and May 1, 2020.Dosages of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were in accordance with the protocol of the Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire de Marseille.Only one patient had asthma and one had COPD.Two patients had to stop their treatment after 3 and 9 days of dual therapy respectively due to QTc prolongation.CONCLUSION: Although this is a retrospective analysis, results suggest that early diagnosis, early isolation and early treatment of COVID-19 patients, with at least 3 days of
