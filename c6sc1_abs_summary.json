{"cluster": 6, "subcluster": 1, "abstract_summ": " The infamous sign problem leads to an exponential complexity in Monte Carlo simulations of generic many-body quantum systems . Many phases of matter are known to admit a sign-problem-free representative, allowing efficient simulations on classical computers . We establish the existence of an intrinsic sign problem in a broad class of gapped, chiral, topological phases ."}
