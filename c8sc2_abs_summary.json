{"cluster": 8, "subcluster": 2, "abstract_summ": " In a Stackelberg pricing problem a distinguished player, the leader, chooses prices for a set of items, and one or several other players, the followers, seeks to buy a feasible subset of the items with minimal costs . In this paper, we show that optimal prices can be computed in polynomial time for all three matroids if there is one follower . We also prove that when revenues are uniform, [Formula: see text] has competitive ratio 4 . We propose an efficient FPTAS algorithm that can solve the problem to any desired accuracy ."}
