This property suggests that, given two words sharing a common overlap, their Lyndon factorizations could be used to capture the common overlap of these two words.Another interesting result relates sorting of global suffixes, i.e., suffixes of a word w, and sorting of local suffixes, i.e., suffixes of the factors in [Formula: see text].", "title_summ": "An Excursion into Word Edit OperationsTransition Property for [Formula: see text]-Power Free Languages with [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] LettersScattered Factor-Universality of WordsReconstructing Words from Right-Bounded-Block WordsNon-coding Enumeration OperatorsLyndon Words versus Inverse Lyndon Words: Queries on Suffixes and Bordered WordsComplete Variable-Length Codes:", "title_abstract_phrases": "We show that a word [Formula: see text] can be reconstructed from the number of occurrences of at most [Formula: see text] scattered factors of the form [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] is the number of occurrences of the letter [Formula: see text] in w.
