{"cluster": 8, "subcluster": 10, "abstract_summ": " We present new results in the calculus for fuzzy-valued functions of a single real variable . We adopt extensively the midpoint-radius representation of intervals in the real half-plane . Concepts related to convergence and limits, continuity, level-wise gH-differentiability of first and second orders have nice and useful midpoint expressions ."}
