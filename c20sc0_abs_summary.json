{"cluster": 20, "subcluster": 0, "abstract_summ": " Analyzing the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from clinical samples is crucial for the understanding of viral spread and viral evolution . Existing sample preparation methods for viral genome sequencing are demanding on user technique and time, and thus not ideal for time-sensitive clinical samples . We have developed a facile, practical, and robust approach for metagenomic and deep viral sequencing ."}
