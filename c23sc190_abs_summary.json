{"cluster": 23, "subcluster": 190, "abstract_summ": " Differences in COVID-19 testing and tracing across countries make it difficult to estimate the true (population) infection rate based on confirmed number of cases obtained through RNA viral testing . Our estimates suggest that the true number of people infected across our sample of 15 developed countries is 18.2 (5-95% CI: 11.9-39.0) times greater than the reported number ."}
