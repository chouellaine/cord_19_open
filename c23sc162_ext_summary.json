We suggest that any future travel related disease infection screening at the airports should critically assess the passengers from major transit hubs in addition to affected country of origin.", "title_summ": "Estimating the establishment of local transmission and the cryptic phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USAAssessing the impact of reduced travel on exportation dynamics of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19)Tracking the origin of early COVID-19 cases in CanadaAssessing the Impact of Reduced Travel on Exportation Dynamics of Novel Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19)Impact of international travel dynamics on domestic spread of 2019-nCoV in India: origin-based risk assessment in importation of infected travelersEstimating the number of undetected COVID-19 cases exported internationally from all of ChinaImpact of international travel and border control measures on the global spread of the novel 2019 coronavirus outbreakRisk Assessment of Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 Outbreaks Outside ChinaThe effect of travel restrictions on the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak[Risk assessment of global COVID-19 imported cases into China].Estimating number of global importations of COVID-19 from Wuhan, risk of transmission outside mainland China and COVID-19 introduction index between countries outside mainland ChinaRisk assessment of novel coronavirus COVID-19 outbreaks outside ChinaDispersion of a new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 by airlines in 2020: Temporal estimates of the outbreak in Mexico.", "title_abstract_phrases": "Methods: We collected epidemic data (cumulative daily confirmed cases in each country, cumulative confirmed imported cases), demographic data (population density, population) and information on potential source groups of tourists (the daily estimated number of overseas Chinese, overseas Chinese students, overseas workers, foreign students coming to China and flight passengers) and the global health security index (GHS) to assess and predict risk of imported cases for recent (February 1st to April 25th) and future (after April 26th).We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy of entry screening at destination; (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number Rloc).We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy of entry screening at destination; and (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number [Formula: see text]).We aim to estimate the number of cases imported from Wuhan to each country or territory outside mainland China, and with these estimates assess the risk of onward local transmission and the relative potential of case importation between countries outside China.Within 2 mo since the outbreak was first reported on December 31, 2019, a total of 566 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS CoV-2) cases have been confirmed in 26 other countries."}
