{"cluster": 23, "subcluster": 232, "abstract_summ": " We use publicly available timeline data on the Covid-19 outbreak for nine indian states to calculate the important quantifier of the outbreak, the sought after Rt or the time varying reproduction number of an outbreak . We identify the optimal lockdown policy as an intervention structured in 4 successive phases: First a quick and strong lockdown intervention to stop the exponential growth of the contagion; second a short transition phase to reduce the prevalence of the virus; third a long period with full ICU capacity and stable virus prevalence; finally a return to normal social interactions with disappearance of virus . The optimal scenario avoids the second wave of infection, provided the lockdown is released sufficiently slowly ."}
