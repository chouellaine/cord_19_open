The first is a data driven approach for predicting the Covid-19 pandemic dynamics, based on data from more advanced countries . The second is to report and discuss the results obtained with this approach for Brazilian states, as of May 4th, 2020 . Results indicate that the pandemic is still growing in Brazil, with most states peaks of infection estimated between the 25th of April and the 19th of May 2020 .
