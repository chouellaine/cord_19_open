However, it remains unclear whether PfSIWB is involved in transcriptional regulation of this virulence gene and its functional properties. METHODS: A conditional knockdown system \u201cPfSWIB-FKBP-LID\u201d was introduced to the parasite clone 3D7, and an integrated parasite line \u201cPfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID\u201d was obtained by drug cycling and clone screening. Growth curve analysis (GCA) was performed to investigate the growth and development of different parasite lines during 96 h in vitro culturing, by assessing parasitemia. Finally, we performed qPCR assays to detect var gene expression profiling in various comparison groups, as well as the mutually exclusive expression pattern of the var genes within a single 48 h life-cycle of P. falciparum in different parasite lines. In addition, RNA-seq was applied to analyze the var gene expression in different lines. RESULTS: GCA revealed that conditional knockdown of PfSWIB could interfere with the growth and development of P. falciparum. The parasitemia of PfSWIB\u2206 showed a significant decline at 96 h during in vitro culture compared with the PfSWIB and 3D7 lines (P < 0.0001). qPCR and RNA-seq analysis confirmed that depletion of PfSWIB not only silences upsA, upsC and partial upsB var genes, as well as removes the silencing of partial upsB var genes at the ring stage in PfSWIB\u2206 line, but also leads to aberrant expression of upsA and partial upsB\/upsC var genes at the mature stage of P. falciparum, during a single 48-h life-cycle. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that PfSWIB was involved in the process of clonal variation in var gene expression, and crucial for the survival and development of Plasmodium parasite.

While virus-host interactions are promising targets for antivirals, there is only limited knowledge regarding the interactions of EBOV with cellular host factors. Recently, we performed a genome-wide siRNA screen that identified the nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1) as an important host factor for the EBOV life cycle. NXF1 is a major component of the nuclear mRNA export pathway that is usurped by many viruses whose life cycles include nuclear stages. However, the role of NXF1 in the life cycle of EBOV, a virus replicating in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, remains unknown. In order to better understand the role of NXF1 in the EBOV life cycle, we performed a combination of co-immunoprecipitation and double immunofluorescence assays to characterize the interactions of NXF1 with viral proteins and RNAs. Additionally, using siRNA-mediated knockdown of NXF1 together with functional assays, we analyzed the role of NXF1 in individual aspects of the virus life cycle. With this approach we identified the EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) as a viral interaction partner of NXF1. Further studies revealed that NP interacts with the RNA-binding domain of NXF1 and competes with RNA for this interaction. Co-localization studies showed that RNA binding-deficient, but not wildtype NXF1, accumulates in NP-derived inclusion bodies, and knockdown experiments demonstrated that NXF1 is necessary for viral protein expression, but not for viral RNA synthesis. Finally, our results showed that NXF1 interacts with viral mRNAs, but not with viral genomic RNAs. Based on these results we suggest a model whereby NXF1 is recruited into inclusion bodies to promote the export of viral mRNA:NXF1 complexes from these sites. This would represent a novel function for NXF1 in the life cycle of cytoplasmically replicating viruses, and may provide a basis for new therapeutic approaches against EBOV, and possibly other emerging viruses.","publish_time":1578700800000,"author_summary":" Wendt, Lisa; Brandt, Janine; Bodmer, Bianca<br>S.; Reiche, Sven; Schmidt, Marie Luisa; Traeger,<br>Shelby; Hoenen, Thomas","abstract_summary":" Ebola virus (EBOV) causes severe outbreaks of<br>viral hemorrhagic fever in humans.

Replication of an influenza A virus lacking NS1 (delNS1), incapable of counteracting the antiviral response, is not affected by Dot1L inhibition. Consequently, RIG-I-MAVS association and nuclear factor\u2013\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) nuclear translocation, are not affected by the Dot1L inhibition in delNS1 infected cells. Restoration of NS1 expression in trans also reinstated Dot1L as a regulator of the RIG-I-dependent signaling in delNS1 infections. Interferon-inducible E3 ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) expression increases in influenza virus infected cells, but Dot1L inhibition reduces both the TRIM25 expression and TRIM25 protein levels. TRIM25 overexpression reverses the defective innate response mediated by Dot1L inhibition elicited upon virus infection or by overexpression of RIG-I signaling intermediates. Thus, TRIM25 is a control point of the RIG-I recognition pathway controlled by Dot1L and may have a general role in RNA viruses recognized by the RIG-I sensor.","publish_time":1584316800000,"author_summary":" Marcos-Villar, Laura; Nistal-Villan,<br>Estanislao; Zamarre\u00f1o, Noelia; Garaigorta, Urtzi;<br>Gastaminza, Pablo; Nieto, Amelia","abstract_summary":" Influenza virus infection increases the<br>methylation of lysine 79 of histone 3 catalyzed by the Dot1L<br>enzyme.

RNA-seq analysis revealed that ZIKV infection alters several and diverse biological processes, including stress, locomotion, lipid metabolism, imaginal disc morphogenesis and regulation of JAK\/STAT signaling. To explore the interaction between ZIKV infection and JAK\/STAT signaling regulation, we generated genetic constructs overexpressing ZIKV-specific non-structural proteins NS2A, NS2B, NS4A and NS4B. We found that ectopic expression of non-structural proteins in the developing Drosophila eye significantly restricts growth of the larval and adult eye and correlates with considerable repression of the in vivo JAK\/STAT reporter, 10XStat92E-GFP. At the cellular level, eye growth defects are associated with reduced rate of proliferation without affecting the overall rate of apoptosis. In addition, ZIKV NS4A genetically interacts with the JAK\/STAT signaling components; co-expression of NS4A along with the dominant-negative form of domeless or StatRNAi results in aggravated reduction in eye size, while co-expression of NS4A in HopTuml (also known as hop(Tum)) mutant background partially rescues the hop-induced eye overgrowth phenotype. The function of ZIKV NS4A in regulating growth is maintained in the wing, where ZIKV NS4A overexpression in the pouch domain results in reduced growth linked with diminished expression of Notch targets, Wingless (Wg) and Cut, and the Notch reporter, NRE-GFP. Thus, our study provides evidence that ZIKV infection in Drosophila results in restricted growth of the developing eye and wing, wherein eye phenotype is induced through regulation of JAK\/STAT signaling, whereas restricted wing growth is induced through regulation of Notch signaling.

In this study, lncRNAs related to respiratory virus infection were obtained from the lncRNA database, and we collected 144 clinical sputum specimens to identify lncRNAs related to RSV infection. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) detection indicated that the expression of lncRNA negative regulator of antiviral response (NRAV) in RSV-positive patients was significantly lower than that in uninfected patients, but lncRNA psoriasis-associated non-protein coding RNA induced by stress (PRINS), nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1), and Nettoie Salmonella pas Theiler\u2019s (NeST) showed no difference in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, overexpression of NRAV promoted RSV proliferation in A549 and BEAS-2B cells, and vice versa, indicating that the downregulation of NRAV was part of the host antiviral defense. RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed that NRAV was mainly located in the cytoplasm. Through RNA sequencing, we found that Rab5c, which is a vesicle transporting protein, showed the same change trend as NRAV. Subsequent investigation revealed that NRAV was able to favor RSV production indirectly by sponging microRNA miR-509-3p so as to release Rab5c and facilitate vesicle transportation.

Given that RIPA is a cellular antiviral pathway, we hypothesized that small molecules that promote RIPA in virus-infected cells would act as antiviral agents. To test this, we conducted a high throughput screen of a library of FDA-approved drugs to identify novel RIPA activators. Our screen identified doxorubicin as a potent RIPA-activating agent. In support of our hypothesis, doxorubicin inhibited the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus, a model rhabdovirus, and its antiviral activity depended on its ability to activate IRF3 in RIPA. Surprisingly, doxorubicin inhibited the transcriptional activity of IRF3. The antiviral activity of doxorubicin was expanded to flavivirus and herpesvirus that also activate IRF3. Mechanistically, doxorubicin promoted RIPA by activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Finally, we validated these results using another RIPA-activating compound, pyrvinium pamoate, which showed a similar antiviral effect without affecting the transcriptional activity of IRF3.

OBJECTIVES: Herein, the purpose of this study is to determine whether the non-structural protein NS1 of PPV also has the same function.

RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that PPV NS1 protein can up-regulate the expression levels of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, PPV NS1 protein was found to induce the phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, then leading to the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB.

Many viruses, including coronavirus, herpesvirus and retrovirus, co-opt host cellular TER94 for optimal viral invasion and replication. Previous proteomics analysis identified the association of TER94 with the budded virions (BVs) of baculovirus, an enveloped insect large DNA virus. Here, the role of TER94 in the prototypic baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) life cycle was investigated. In virus-infected cells, TER94 accumulated in virogenic stroma (VS) at the early stage of infection and subsequently partially rearranged to the ring zone region. In the virions, TER94 was associated with the nucleocapsids of both BV and occlusion-derived virus (ODV). Inhibition of TER94 ATPase activity significantly reduced viral DNA replication and BV production. Electron\/immunoelectron microscopy revealed that inhibition of TER94 resulted in the trapping of nucleocapsids within cytoplasmic vacuoles at the nuclear periphery for BV formation and blockage of ODV envelopment at a pre-mature stage within infected nuclei, which appeared highly consistent with its pivotal function in membrane biogenesis. Further analyses showed that TER94 was recruited to the VS or subnuclear structures through interaction with viral early proteins LEF3 and helicase, whereas inhibition of TER94 activity blocked the proper localization of replication-related viral proteins and morphogenesis of VS, providing an explanation for its role in viral DNA replication. Taken together, these data indicated the crucial functions of TER94 at multiple steps of baculovirus life cycle including genome replication, BV formation, and ODV morphogenesis.IMPORTANCE TER94 constitutes an important AAA+ ATPase that associates with diverse cellular processes including protein quality control, membrane fusion of the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum network, nuclear envelope reformation, and DNA replication. To date, little is known regarding the role(s) of TER94 in the baculovirus life cycle. In this study, TER94 was found to play a crucial role in multiple steps of baculovirus infection including viral DNA replication and BV- and ODV formation. Further evidence showed that the membrane fission\/fusion function of TER94 is likely to be exploited by baculovirus for virion morphogenesis. Moreover, TER94 could interact with the viral early proteins LEF3 and helicase to transport to and further recruit viral replication-related proteins to establish viral replication factories. This study highlights the critical roles of TER94 as an energy-supplying chaperon in the baculovirus life cycle and enriches our knowledge regarding the biological function of this important host factor.","publish_time":1577923200000,"author_summary":" Li, Yimeng; Hu, Liangbo; Chen, Tong; Chang,<br>Meng; Deng, Fei; Hu, Zhihong; Wang, Hualin; Wang,<br>Manli","abstract_summary":" TER94 is a multifunctional AAA+ ATPase crucial<br>for diverse cellular processes, especially<br>protein quality control and chromatin dynamics in<br>eukaryotic organisms.

However, cobalamin can be synthesized only by few microorganisms so most bacteria need to take it up from the environment through the TonB-dependent transport system. The first stage of cobalamin import to E. coli cells occurs through the outer-membrane receptor called BtuB. Vitamin B12 binds with high affinity to the extracellular side of the BtuB protein. BtuB forms a \u03b2-barrel with inner luminal domain and extracellular loops. To mechanically allow for cobalamin passage, the luminal domain needs to partially unfold with the help of the inner-membrane TonB protein. However, the mechanism of cobalamin permeation is unknown. Using all-atom molecular dynamics, we simulated the transport of cobalamin through the BtuB receptor embedded in an asymmetric and heterogeneous E. coli outer membrane. To enhance conformational sampling of the BtuB loops, we developed the Gaussian force-simulated annealing method (GF-SA) and coupled it with umbrella sampling. We found that cobalamin needs to rotate in order to permeate through BtuB. We showed that the mobility of BtuB extracellular loops is crucial for cobalamin binding and transport and resembles an induced fit mechanism. Loop mobility depends not only on the position of cobalamin but also on the extension of luminal domain. We provided atomistic details of cobalamin transport through the BtuB receptor showing the essential role of the mobility of BtuB extracellular loops.

Using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an Alphacoronavirus, as a model, we showed that G-N-7 methyltransferase (G-N-7 MTase) of PEDV nsp14 methylated RNA substrates in a sequence-unspecific manner. PEDV nsp14 can efficiently methylate RNA substrates with various lengths in both neutral and alkaline pH environment, and can methylate cap analogs (GpppA and GpppG) and single nucleotide GTP but not ATP, CTP, or UTP. Mutations to the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) binding motif in the nsp14 abolished the G-N-7 MTase activity and were lethal to PEDV.

In this study, we observed that MERS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein suppresses type I and III IFN gene expression. The N protein suppresses Sendai virus-induced IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb1 by reducing their promoter activity and mRNA levels as well as downstream IFN stimulated genes (ISGs). Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) is known to recognize viral RNA and induce IFN expression through tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25)-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs). We discovered that MERS-CoV N protein suppresses RIG-I-CARD-, but not MDA5-CARD-induced IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb1 promoter activity. By interacting with TRIM25, N protein impedes RIG-I ubiquitination and activation and inhibits the phosphorylation of transcription factors IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-\u03baB that are known to be important for IFN gene activation. By employing recombinant Sindbis virus-EGFP replication system, we showed that viral N protein downregulated the production of not only IFN mRNA but also bioactive IFN proteins. Taken together, MERS-CoV N protein functions as an IFN antagonist. It suppresses RIG-I-induced type I and type III IFN production by interfering with TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. Our study sheds light on the pathogenic mechanism of how MERS-CoV causes disease.IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV causes death of about 35% of patients. Published studies showed that some coronaviruses are capable of suppressing interferon (IFN) expression in the early phase of infection and MERS-CoV proteins can modulate host immune response. In this study, we demonstrated that MERS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein suppresses the production of both type I and type III IFNs via sequestering TRIM25, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is essential for activating RIG-I signaling pathway.

CoVs infect various organs including respiratory and enteric systems, as exemplified by the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. The constellation of viral factors that contribute to developing enteric disease remains elusive. Here, we investigated CoV interferon antagonists for their contribution to enteric pathogenesis. Using an infectious clone of an enteric CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (icPEDV), we generated viruses with inactive versions of interferon antagonist nonstructural proteins 1, 15, and 16 individually, or combined in one virus designated icPEDV-mut4. Interferon-responsive PK1 cells were infected with these viruses and produced higher levels of interferon responses, as compared to wild-type icPEDV infection. icPEDV-mut4 elicited robust interferon responses and was severely impaired for replication in PK1 cells. To evaluate viral pathogenesis, piglets were infected with either icPEDV or icPEDV-mut4. While the icPEDV-infected piglets exhibited clinical disease, the icPEDV-mut4-infected piglets showed no clinical symptoms and exhibited normal intestinal pathology at day 2 post-infection. The icPEDV-mut4 replicated in the intestinal tract, as revealed by detection of viral RNA in fecal swabs, with sequence analysis documenting genetic stability of the input strain. Importantly, icPEDV-mut4 infection elicited IgG and neutralizing antibody responses to PEDV. These results identify nsp1, nsp15, and nsp16 as virulence factors that contribute to the development of PEDV-induced diarrhea in swine.

New approaches are needed to understand enteric pathogenesis and develop vaccines and therapeutics to prevent the spread of these viruses. Here, we exploit a reverse genetic system for an enteric CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and outline an approach of genetically inactivating highly conserved viral factors known to limit the host innate immune response to infection. Our study reveals that generating PEDV with inactive versions of three viral interferon antagonists, nonstructural proteins 1, 15 and 16, results in a highly attenuated virus that does not cause diarrhea in animals, and elicits a neutralizing antibody response in virus-infected animals. This strategy may be useful for generating live-attenuated vaccine candidates that prevent disease and fecal spread of enteric CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":1592352000000,"author_summary":" Deng, Xufang; Buckley, Alexandra C;<br>Pillatzki, Angela; Lager, Kelly M; Faaberg, Kay S; Baker,<br>Susan C","abstract_summary":" Coronaviruses (CoVs) have repeatedly emerged<br>from wildlife hosts into humans and livestock<br>animals to cause epidemics with significant morbidity<br>and mortality.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) provides a promising but challenging drug target due to its intrinsic proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) function. Nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) analogues added to the growing RNA chain should supposedly terminate viral RNA replication, but ExoN can cleave the incorporated compounds and counteract their efficacy. Remdesivir targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp exerts high drug efficacy in vitro and in vivo. However, its underlying inhibitory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with an accumulated simulation time of 12.6 microseconds to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of remdesivir in nucleotide addition (RdRp complex: nsp12-nsp7-nsp8) and proofreading (ExoN complex: nsp14-nsp10). We found that the 1\u2019-cyano group of remdesivir possesses the dual role of inhibiting both nucleotide addition and proofreading. For nucleotide addition, we showed that incorporation of one remdesivir is not sufficient to terminate RNA synthesis. Instead, the presence of the polar 1\u2019-cyano group of remdesivir at an upstream site causes instability via its electrostatic interactions with a salt bridge formed by Asp865 and Lys593, rendering translocation unfavourable. This may eventually lead to a delayed chain termination of RNA extension by three nucleotides. For proofreading, remdesivir can inhibit cleavage via the steric clash between the 1\u2019-cyano group and Asn104. To further examine the role of 1\u2019-cyano group in remdesivir\u2019s inhibitory effects, we studied three additional NTP analogues with other types of modifications: favipiravir, vidarabine, and fludarabine. Our simulations suggest that all three of them are prone to ExoN cleavage. Our computational findings were further supported by an in vitro assay in Vero E6 cells using live SARS-CoV-2. The dose-response curves suggest that among tested NTP analogues, only remdesivir exerts significant inhibitory effects on viral replication. Our work provides plausible mechanisms at molecular level on how remdesivir inhibits viral RNA replication, and our findings may guide rational design for new treatments of COVID-19 targeting viral replication.","publish_time":1587945600000,"author_summary":" Zhang, Lu; Zhang, Dong; Yuan, Congmin; Wang,<br>Xiaowei; Li, Yongfang; Jia, Xilin; Gao, Xin; Yen,<br>Hui-Ling; Cheung, Peter Pak-Hang; Huang, Xuhui","abstract_summary":" COVID-19 has recently caused a global health<br>crisis and an effective interventional therapy is<br>urgently needed.

The HSV cVAC also concentrates host membranes that are important for viral assembly, such as Golgi- and recycling endosome-derived membranes.

The goal is to identify nucleotide analogues that not only terminate RNA synthesis catalyzed by these coronavirus RdRps, but also have the potential to resist the viruses\u2019 exonuclease activity. We examined these nucleotide analogues with regard to their ability to be incorporated by the RdRps in the polymerase reaction and then prevent further incorporation. While all 11 molecules tested displayed incorporation, 6 exhibited immediate termination of the polymerase reaction (Carbovir triphosphate, Ganciclovir triphosphate, Stavudine triphosphate, Entecavir triphosphate, 3\u2019-O-methyl UTP and Biotin-16-dUTP), 2 showed delayed termination (Cidofovir diphosphate and 2\u2019-O-methyl UTP), and 3 did not terminate the polymerase reaction (2\u2019-fluoro-dUTP, 2\u2019-amino-dUTP and Desthiobiotin-16-UTP). The coronavirus genomes encode an exonuclease that apparently requires a 2\u2019 -OH group to excise mismatched bases at the 3\u2019-terminus. In this study, all of the nucleoside triphosphate analogues we evaluated form Watson-Cricklike base pairs. All the nucleotide analogues which demonstrated termination either lack a 2\u2019-OH, have a blocked 2\u2019-OH, or show delayed termination. These nucleotides may thus have the potential to resist exonuclease activity, a property that we will investigate in the future. Furthermore, prodrugs of five of these nucleotide analogues (Brincidofovir\/Cidofovir, Abacavir, Valganciclovir\/Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir) are FDA approved for other viral infections, and their safety profile is well known.

Of the 7 human coronaviruses discovered to date, 3 emergent and severe human coronavirus strains (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) have recently jumped to humans in the last 20 years. The COVID-19 pandemic spawned by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 has highlighted the importance for development of effective therapeutics to target emerging coronaviruses. Upon entry, the replicase genes of coronaviruses are translated and subsequently proteolytically processed by virus-encoded proteases. Of these proteases, nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5, Mpro, or 3CLpro), mediates the majority of these cleavages and remains a key drug target for therapeutic inhibitors. Efforts to develop nsp5 active-site inhibitors for human coronaviruses have thus far been unsuccessful, establishing the need for identification of other critical and conserved non-active-site regions of the protease. In this study, we describe the identification of an essential, conserved horseshoe-shaped region in the nsp5 interdomain loop (IDL) of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a common coronavirus replication model. Using site-directed mutagenesis and replication studies, we show that several residues comprising this horseshoe-shaped region either fail to tolerate mutagenesis or were associated with viral temperature-sensitivity. Structural modeling and sequence analysis of these sites in other coronaviruses, including all 7 human coronaviruses, suggests that the identified structure and sequence of this horseshoe regions is highly conserved and may represent a new, non-active-site regulatory region of the nsp5 (3CLpro) protease to target with coronavirus inhibitors. Importance In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in humans and triggered a pandemic which has to date resulted in over 8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 across more than 180 countries and territories (June 2020). SARS-CoV-2 represents the third emergent coronavirus in the past 20 years and the future emergence of new coronaviruses in humans remains certain. Critically, there remains no vaccine nor established therapeutics to treat cases of COVID-19. The coronavirus nsp5 protease is a conserved and indispensable virus-encoded enzyme which remains a key target for therapeutic design. However, past attempts to target the active site of nsp5 with inhibitors have failed stressing the need to identify new conserved non-active-site targets for therapeutic development. This study describes the discovery of a novel conserved structural region of the nsp5 protease of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) which may provide a new target for coronavirus drug development.","publish_time":1592524800000,"author_summary":" Nick, Benjamin C.; Pandya, Mansi C.; Lu,<br>Xiaotao; Franke, Megan E.; Callahan, Sean M.; Hasik,<br>Emily F.; Berthrong, Sean T.; Denison, Mark R.;<br>Stobart, Christopher C.","abstract_summary":" Human coronaviruses are enveloped,<br>positive-strand RNA viruses which cause respiratory diseases<br>ranging in severity from the seasonal common cold to<br>SARS and COVID-19.

We used a rational ligand-based interface design complemented with mutational mapping to generate a total of 100,000 mutations and provide insight into the functional outcome of mutations in the Remdesivir-binding site in nsp12. After designing 56 residues in the Remdesivir binding site of nsp12, the designs retained 96-98% sequence identity, which suggests that SARS-CoV-2 attains resistance and develops further infectivity with very few mutations in the nsp12. We also identified affinity-attenuating Remdesivir binding designs of nsp12. Several mutants acquired decreased binding affinity with Remdesivir, which suggested drug resistance. These hotspot residues had a higher probability of undergoing selective mutations in the future to develop Remdesivir and related drug-based resistance. A comparison of 21 nsp12 Remdesivir-bound designs to the 13 EIDD-2801-bound nsp12 designs suggested that EIDD-2801 would be more effective in preventing the emergence of resistant mutations and against Remdesivir-resistance strains due to the restricted mutational landscape.

DNA methylation and demethylation is a key mechanism of genome programming and reprogramming. During ontogenesis, the DNA methylome undergoes both programmed changes and those induced by environmental and endogenous factors. The former enable accurate activation of developmental programs; the latter drive epigenetic responses to factors that directly or indirectly affect epigenetic biochemistry leading to alterations in genome regulation and mediating organism response to environmental transformations. Adverse environmental exposure can induce aberrant DNA methylation changes conducive to genetic dysfunction and, eventually, various pathologies. In recent years, evidence was derived that apart from 5-methylcytosine, the DNA methylation\/demethylation cycle includes three other oxidative derivatives of cytosine\u20145-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine, and 5-carboxylcytosine. 5hmC is a predominantly stable form and serves as both an intermediate product of active DNA demethylation and an essential hallmark of epigenetic gene regulation. This makes 5hmC a potential contributor to epigenetically mediated responses to environmental factors. In this state-of-the-art review, we consolidate the latest findings on environmentally induced adverse effects on 5hmC patterns in mammalian genomes. Types of environmental exposure under consideration include hypnotic drugs and medicines (i.e., phenobarbital, diethylstilbestrol, cocaine, methamphetamine, ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide), as well as anthropogenic pollutants (i.e., heavy metals, particulate air pollution, bisphenol A, hydroquinone, and pentachlorophenol metabolites). We put a special focus on the discussion of molecular mechanisms underlying environmentally induced alterations in DNA hydroxymethylation patterns and their impact on genetic dysfunction. We conclude that DNA hydroxymethylation is a sensitive biosensor for many harmful environmental factors each of which specifically targets 5hmC in different organs, cell types, and DNA sequences and induces its changes through a specific metabolic pathway. The associated transcriptional changes suggest that environmentally induced 5hmC alterations play a role in epigenetically mediated genome flexibility. We believe that knowledge accumulated in this review together with further studies will provide a solid basis for new approaches to epigenetic therapy and chemoprevention of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity involving 5hmC patterns.","publish_time":1588377600000,"author_summary":" Efimova, Olga A.; Koltsova, Alla S.; Krapivin,<br>Mikhail I.; Tikhonov, Andrei V.; Pendina, Anna A.","abstract_summary":" Convincing evidence accumulated over the last<br>decades demonstrates the crucial role of epigenetic<br>modifications for mammalian genome regulation and its<br>flexibility.

Furthermore, ISG15 exerts functions in its free form both, as an intracellular and as a secreted protein. In agreement with its role as a type I IFN effector, most functions of ISG15 and ISGylation are linked to the anti-pathogenic response. However, also key roles in other cellular processes such as protein translation, cytoskeleton dynamics, exosome secretion, autophagy or genome stability and cancer were described. Ubiquitin-specific protease 18 (USP18) constitutes the major ISG15 specific protease which counteracts ISG15 conjugation. Remarkably, USP18 also functions as a critical negative regulator of the IFN response irrespective of its enzymatic activity. Concordantly, lack of USP18 function causes fatal interferonopathies in humans and mice. The negative regulatory function of USP18 in IFN signaling is regulated by various protein\u2013protein interactions and its stability is controlled via proteasomal degradation. The broad repertoire of physiological functions and regulation of ISG15 and USP18 offers a variety of potential intervention strategies which might be of therapeutic use. Due to the high mutation rates of pathogens which are often species specific and constantly give rise to a variety of immune evasion mechanisms, immune effector systems are under constant evolutionarily pressure. Therefore, it is not surprising that considerable differences in ISG15 with respect to function and sequence exist even among closely related species. Hence, it is essential to thoroughly evaluate the translational potential of results obtained in model organisms especially for therapeutic strategies. This review covers existing and conceptual assay systems to target and identify modulators of ISG15, ISGylation, USP18 function, and protein\u2013protein interactions within this context.

We examined these nucleotide analogues for their ability to be incorporated by the RdRps in the polymerase reaction and to prevent further incorporation. While all 11 molecules tested displayed incorporation, 6 exhibited immediate termination of the polymerase reaction (triphosphates of Carbovir, Ganciclovir, Stavudine and Entecavir; 3\u2019-OMe-UTP and Biotin-16-dUTP), 2 showed delayed termination (Cidofovir diphosphate and 2\u2019-OMe-UTP), and 3 did not terminate the polymerase reaction (2\u2019-F-dUTP, 2\u2019-NH(2)-dUTP and Desthiobiotin-16-UTP).

OBJECTIVES: We elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which the cyclophilin inhibitors Cyclosporin A (CsA) and Alisporivir (ALV) restrict MERS-CoV to validate their suitability as readily-available therapy in MERS-CoV infection. METHODS: Calu-3 cells and primary human alveolar epithelial cells (hAEC) were infected with MERS-CoV and treated with CsA or ALV or inhibitors targeting cyclophilin inhibitor-regulated molecules including Calcineurin, NFAT, or MAP kinases. Novel CsA-induced pathways were identified by RNA sequencing and manipulated by gene knockdown or neutralising antibodies. Viral replication was quantified by qRT-PCR and TCID(50). Data were validated in a murine MERS-CoV infection model. RESULTS: CsA and ALV both reduced MERS-CoV titers and viral RNA replication in Calu-3 and hAEC improving epithelial integrity. While neither Calcineurin nor NFAT inhibition reduced MERS-CoV propagation, blockade of c-Jun N-terminal kinase diminished infectious viral particle release but not RNA accumulation. Importantly, CsA induced interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), a pronounced type-III-interferon (IFN\u03bb) response and expression of antiviral genes. Down-regulation of IRF1 or IFN\u03bb increased MERS-CoV propagation in presence of CsA. Importantly, oral application of CsA reduced MERS-CoV replication in vivo, correlating with elevated lung IFN\u03bb levels and improved outcome.

Some of these mono-ARTDs feature antiviral activity while certain RNA viruses, including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), encode mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolases, suggesting a role for mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) in host-virus conflicts. CHIKV expresses four non-structural proteins (nsP1-nsP4), with nsP3 containing a macrodomain that hydrolyzes and thereby reverses protein MARylation in vitro and in cells. This de-MARylation activity is essential as hydrolase inactivating mutations result in replication defective virus. However, the substrates of MARylation during CHIKV infection are unknown and thus it is unclear how the macrodomain contributes to virus replication and how mono-ARTD-dependent MARylation confers antiviral immunity. We identified ARTD10 and ARTD12 as restriction factors for CHIKV replication in a catalytic activity-dependent manner. CHIKV replication requires processing of the non-structural polyprotein nsP1-4 by the nsP2-encoded protease and the assembly of the four individual nsPs into a functional replication complex. Expression of ARTD10 and ARTD12 resulted in a reduction of processed nsPs. Similarly, MAR hydrolase inactive CHIKV replicon mutants revealed a decrease in processed nsPs, comparable to an nsP2 protease defective mutant. This suggested that the macrodomain contributes to nsP2 protease activity. In support, a hydrolase-deficient virus was complemented by a protease-deficient virus. We hypothesized that MARylation regulates the proteolytic function of nsP2. Indeed, we found that nsP2 is MARylated by ARTD10. This inhibited nsP2 protease activity, thereby preventing polyprotein processing and consequently virus replication. This inhibition was antagonized by the MAR hydrolase activity of nsP3. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the need of the viral MAR hydrolase for efficient replication of CHIKV. Author Summary Infectious diseases still pose major health threats. Especially fast evolving viruses find ever new strategies to manipulate the immune response. With climate warming and increased human mobility vector-borne pathogens like Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spread and cause world-wide epidemics. Beyond the acute phase, CHIKV patients regularly suffer from chronic rheumatism. This entails a decline in life quality and an economic burden. To date no drugs are approved and the mode of pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we describe a mechanistic function of the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain. We found that the viral nsP2 is mono-ADP-ribosylated interfering with its auto-proteolytic function. The nsP3 macrodomain removes this modification and restores the protease activity that is essential for replication. Because macrodomains are highly conserved they might represent broad antiviral targets.","publish_time":1578441600000,"author_summary":" Krieg, Sarah; Pott, Fabian; Eckei, Laura;<br>Verheirstraeten, Maud; B\u00fctepage, Mareike; Lippok, Barbara;<br>Goffinet, Christine; L\u00fcscher, Bernhard; Verheugd,<br>Patricia","abstract_summary":" A subset of intracellular<br>mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases diphtheria toxin-like (ARTDs, aka<br>mono-PARPs) is induced by type I interferons.

PANTHER gene function analysis results indicated that viral derived miRNA candidates could target various human genes involved in crucial cellular processes including transcription, metabolism, defense system and several signaling pathways such as Wnt and EGFR signalings. Protein class-based grouping of targeted human genes showed that host transcription might be one of the main targets of the virus since 96 genes involved in transcriptional processes were potential targets of predicted viral miRNAs.

In infected cells, N proteins are present at the replication-transcription complexes (RTCs), the sites of CoV RNA synthesis. It has been shown that N proteins are important for viral replication and that the one of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a commonly used model CoV, interacts with nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), a component of the RTCs. These two aspects of the CoV life cycle, however, have not been linked. We found that the MHV N protein binds exclusively to nsp3 and not other RTC components by using a systematic yeast two-hybrid approach, and we identified two distinct regions in the N protein that redundantly mediate this interaction. A selective N protein variant carrying point mutations in these two regions fails to bind nsp3 in vitro, resulting in inhibition of its recruitment to RTCs in vivo. Furthermore, in contrast to the wild-type N protein, this N protein variant impairs the stimulation of genomic RNA and viral mRNA transcription in vivo and in vitro, which in turn leads to impairment of MHV replication and progeny production. Altogether, our results show that N protein recruitment to RTCs, via binding to nsp3, is an essential step in the CoV life cycle because it is critical for optimal viral RNA synthesis.

Severe respiratory tract infection outbreaks caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV, however, have caused high pathogenicity and mortality rates in humans. These outbreaks highlighted the relevance of being able to control CoV infections. We used a model CoV, MHV, to investigate the importance of the recruitment of N protein, a central component of CoV virions, to intracellular platforms where CoVs replicate, transcribe, and translate their genomes. By identifying the principal binding partner at these intracellular platforms and generating a specific mutant, we found that N protein recruitment to these locations is crucial for promoting viral RNA synthesis.

Similarly, the known three-dimensional structures adopt a limited number of protein folds. However, proteins exert a large variety of functions and show a remarkable ability for regulation and immediate response to intracellular and extracellular stimuli. To some degree, the wide variability of protein function can be attributed to the post-translational modifications. Post-translational modifications have been observed in all kingdoms of life and give to proteins a significant degree of chemical and consequently functional and structural diversity. Their importance is partly reflected in the large number of genes dedicated to their regulation. So far, hundreds of post-translational modifications have been observed while it is believed that many more are to be discovered along with the technological advances in sequencing, proteomics, mass spectrometry and structural biology. Indeed, the number of studies which report novel post translational modifications is getting larger supporting the notion that their space is still largely unexplored. In this review we explore the impact of post-translational modifications on protein structure and function with emphasis on catalytic activity regulation. We present examples of proteins and protein families whose catalytic activity is substantially affected by the presence of post translational modifications and we describe the molecular basis which underlies the regulation of the protein function through these modifications. When available, we also summarize the current state of knowledge on the mechanisms which introduce these modifications to protein sites.","publish_time":1593216000000,"author_summary":" Kokkinidis, Michael; Glykos, Nicholas M.;<br>Fadouloglou, Vasiliki E.","abstract_summary":" Protein composition is restricted by the<br>genetic code to a relatively small number of natural<br>amino acids.

In vitro biochemical data further suggest that mutations at these two sites affect RNA binding, EC stability, but not polymerase catalytic rate (k(cat)) and apparent NTP affinity (K(M,NTP)). We propose that, although rarely captured by crystallography, similar surface pocket interaction with nucleobase may commonly exist in nucleic acid motor enzymes to facilitate their processivity.

Here, we evaluated the host transcriptional response to infection with murine coronaviruses encoding independent mutations in one of two different viral antagonists, the deubiquitinase (DUB) within nonstructural protein 3 or the endoribonuclease (EndoU) within nonstructural protein 15. We used transcriptomics approaches to compare the scope and kinetics of the host response to the wild-type (WT), DUBmut, and EndoUmut viruses in infected macrophages. We found that the EndoUmut virus activates a focused response that predominantly involves type I interferons and interferon-related genes, whereas the WT and DUBmut viruses more broadly stimulate upregulation of over 2,800 genes, including networks associated with activating the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the proinflammatory response associated with viral pathogenesis. This study highlights the role of viral interferon antagonists in shaping the kinetics and magnitude of the host response during virus infection and demonstrates that inactivating a dominant viral antagonist, the coronavirus endoribonuclease, dramatically alters the host response in macrophages. IMPORTANCE Macrophages are an important cell type during coronavirus infections because they \u201cnotice\u201d the infection and respond by inducing type I interferons, which limits virus replication. In turn, coronaviruses encode proteins that mitigate the cell\u2019s ability to signal an interferon response. Here, we evaluated the host macrophage response to two independent mutant coronaviruses, one with reduced deubiquitinating activity (DUBmut) and the other containing an inactivated endoribonuclease (EndoUmut). We observed a rapid, robust, and focused response to the EndoUmut virus, which was characterized by enhanced expression of interferon and interferon-related genes. In contrast, wild-type virus and the DUBmut virus elicited a more limited interferon response and ultimately activated over 2,800 genes, including players in the unfolded protein response and proinflammatory pathways associated with progression of significant disease. This study reveals that EndoU activity substantially contributes to the ability of coronaviruses to evade the host innate response and to replicate in macrophages.","publish_time":1589760000000,"author_summary":" Volk, Aaron; Hackbart, Matthew; Deng, Xufang;<br>Cruz-Pulido, Yazmin; O\u2019Brien, Amornrat; Baker, Susan C.","abstract_summary":" Coronaviruses (CoVs) encode multiple<br>interferon (IFN) antagonists that modulate the host<br>response to virus replication.

We determined a 1.4 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of this protein\u2019s N2b domain, revealing a compact, intertwined dimer very similar to that of related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Using size exclusion chromatography and multi-angle light scattering, we find that this domain forms a dimer in solution, and that addition of the C-terminal spacer B\/N3 domain mediates tetramer formation. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we find evidence that at least part of this putatively disordered domain is structured, potentially forming an \u03b1-helix that either self-associates or docks against the N2b domain to mediate tetramer formation. Finally, we map the locations of over 4,400 individual amino acid substitutions in the N protein from (~)17,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and find that they are strongly clustered in the protein\u2019s N2a linker domain. The nearly 300 substitutions identified within the N1b and N2b domains cluster away from their functional RNA binding and dimerization interfaces. Overall, this work reveals the architecture and self-assembly properties of a key protein in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. As the N protein is a common target of patient antibodies, this work will also benefit ongoing efforts to develop robust and specific serological tests, and could also benefit the analysis of patient-derived antibodies.","publish_time":1589673600000,"author_summary":" Ye, Qiaozhen; West, Alan M.V.; Silletti,<br>Steve; Corbett, Kevin D.","abstract_summary":" The COVID-2019 pandemic is the most severe<br>acute public health threat of the twenty-first<br>century.

Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) play essential roles in viral RNA synthesis, and thus remains the target of choice for the prophylactic or curative treatment of several viral diseases, due to high sequence and structural conservation. To date, the most promising broad-spectrum class of viral RdRp inhibitors are nucleoside analogues (NAs), with over 25 approved for the treatment of several medically important viral diseases. However, Coronaviruses stand out as a particularly challenging case for NA drug design due to the presence of an exonuclease (ExoN) domain capable of excising incorporated NAs and thus providing resistance to many of these available antivirals. Here we use the available structures of the SARS-CoV RdRp and ExoN proteins, as well as Lassa virus N exonuclease to derive models of catalytically competent SARS-CoV-2 enzymes. We then map a promising NA candidate, GS-441524 (the active metabolite of Remdesivir) to the nucleoside active site of both proteins, identifying the residues important for nucleotide recognition, discrimination, and excision.

We further showed that antibody ligation induces extensive internalisation from the plasma membrane into endocytic compartments of MLV envelope glycoproteins, which are not normally subject to constitutive endocytosis.

The N-terminus 75 kDa fragment of UL36 exists in MD T lymphoma cells at a high level and participates in MDV pathogenicity. (2) Methods: To characterize deubiquitinating activity and substrate specificity of UL36-DUB, the UL36 N-terminal fragments, UL36(323), UL36(480), and mutants were prepared using the Bac-to-Bac system. The deubiquitinating activity and substrate specificity of these recombinant UL36-DUBs were analyzed using various ubiquitin (Ub) or ubiquitin-like (UbL) substrates and activity-based deubiquitinating enzyme probes. (3) Results: The results indicated that wild type UL36-DUBs show a different hydrolysis ability against varied types of ubiquitin chains. These wild type UL36-DUBs presented the highest activity to K11, K48, and K63 linkage Ub chains, weak activity to K6, K29, and K33 Ub chains, and no activity to K27 linkage Ub chain. UL36 has higher cleavage efficiency for K48 and K63 poly-ubiquitin than linear ubiquitin chain (M1-Ub4), but no activity on various ubiquitin-like modifiers. The mutation of C98 and H234 residues eliminated the deubiquitinating activity of UL36-DUB. D232A mutation impacted, but did not eliminated UL36(480) activity.

The first macrodomain, Mac1, is conserved throughout CoVs, binds to and hydrolyzes mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) from target proteins. Mac1 likely counters host-mediated anti-viral ADP-ribosylation, a posttranslational modification that is part of the host response to viral infections. Mac1 is essential for pathogenesis in multiple animal models of CoV infection, implicating it as a virulence factor and potential therapeutic target. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 exhibit similar structural folds and all 3 proteins bound to ADP-ribose with low \u03bcM affinities. In contrast, we found that only the MERS-CoV Mac1 protein bound to poly-ADP-ribose (PAR), and none of these enzymes could hydrolyze PAR. Importantly, using ADP-ribose detecting antibodies and both gel-based assay and novel ELISA assays, we demonstrated highly efficient de-MARylating activity for all 3 CoV Mac1 proteins. We conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV Mac1 proteins are highly efficient MAR-hydrolases with strikingly similar activity, indicating that compounds targeting CoV Mac1 proteins may have broad anti-CoV activity.

With, no currently approved treatments, novel therapeutic strategies are desperately needed.

The macrodomain is essential for CoV pathogenesis and may be a novel therapeutic target. Thus, understanding its biochemistry and enzyme activity are critical first steps for these efforts. Here we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 in complex with ADP-ribose, and describe its ADP-ribose binding and hydrolysis activities in direct comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV Mac1 proteins.

Moreover, A9 exhibited potent antiviral activity against the replication of various CoVs, including murine hepatitis virus (MHV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV).

We then built a putative preinsertion binding structure by aligning the remdesivir + RdRp complex to the ATP bound poliovirus RdRp without the RNA template. The putative binding structure was further optimized with molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting stable preinsertion state of remdesivir appeared to form hydrogen bonds with the RNA template when aligned with the newly solved cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.

Furthermore, we have identified proteasome activator PA28\u03b3 as a nCoV N binding protein by co-immunoprecipitation assay.

PLP2 acts as a protease that cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein and as a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme which removes ubiquitin (Ub) moieties from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Previous in vitro studies implicated PLP2\/DUB activity as a negative regulator of the host interferon (IFN) response, but the role of DUB activity during virus infection was unknown. Here, we used X-ray structure-guided mutagenesis and functional studies to identify amino acid substitutions within the ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2 that reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein processing activity. We engineered a DUB mutation (Asp1772 to Ala) into a murine coronavirus and evaluated the replication and pathogenesis of the DUB mutant virus (DUBmut) in cultured macrophages and in mice. We found that the DUBmut virus replicates similarly to the wild-type (WT) virus in cultured cells, but the DUBmut virus activates an IFN response at earlier times compared to the wild-type virus infection in macrophages, consistent with DUB activity negatively regulating the IFN response. We compared the pathogenesis of the DUBmut virus to that of the wild-type virus and found that the DUBmut-infected mice had a statistically significant reduction (P < 0.05) in viral titer in liver and spleen at day 5 postinfection (d p.i.), although both wild-type and DUBmut virus infections resulted in similar liver pathology. Overall, this study demonstrates that structure-guided mutagenesis aids the identification of critical determinants of the PLP2-ubiquitin complex and that PLP2\/DUB activity plays a role as an interferon antagonist in coronavirus pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses employ a genetic economy by encoding multifunctional proteins that function in viral replication and also modify the host environment to disarm the innate immune response. The coronavirus papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain possesses protease activity, which cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and also DUB activity (deconjugating ubiquitin\/ubiquitin-like molecules from modified substrates) using identical catalytic residues. To separate the DUB activity from the protease activity, we employed a structure-guided mutagenesis approach and identified residues that are important for ubiquitin binding. We found that mutating the ubiquitin-binding residues results in a PLP2 that has reduced DUB activity but retains protease activity. We engineered a recombinant murine coronavirus to express the DUB mutant and showed that the DUB mutant virus activated an earlier type I interferon response in macrophages and exhibited reduced replication in mice. The results of this study demonstrate that PLP2\/DUB is an interferon antagonist and a virulence trait of coronaviruses.","publish_time":1589760000000,"author_summary":" Deng, Xufang; Chen, Yafang; Mielech, Anna M.;<br>Hackbart, Matthew; Kesely, Kristina R.; Mettelman,<br>Robert C.; O\u2019Brien, Amornrat; Chapman, Mackenzie E.;<br>Mesecar, Andrew D.; Baker, Susan C.","abstract_summary":" Coronaviruses express a multifunctional<br>papain-like protease, termed papain-like protease 2<br>(PLP2).

Previous studies in bovine cells demonstrated that deletions (leaderless [LLV]) or point mutations in Lpro result in increased expression of interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), including, among others, the ubiquitin-like protein modifier ISG15 and the ubiquitin specific peptidase USP18. In addition to its conventional papain-like protease activity, Lpro acts as a deubiquitinase (DUB) and deISGylase. In this study, we identified a conserved residue in Lpro that is involved in its interaction with ISG15. Mutation W105A rendered Escherichia coli-expressed Lpro unable to cleave the synthetic substrate pro-ISG15 while preserving cellular eIF4G cleavage. Interestingly, mutant FMDV W105A was viable. Overexpression of ISG15 and the ISGylation machinery in porcine cells resulted in moderate inhibition of FMDV replication, along with a decrease of the overall state of ISGylation in wild-type (WT)-infected cells. In contrast, reduced deISGylation was observed upon infection with W105A and leaderless virus. Reduction in the levels of deubiquitination was also observed in cells infected with the FMDV LproW105A mutant. Surprisingly, similarly to WT, infection with W105A inhibited IFN\/ISG expression despite displaying an attenuated phenotype in vivo in mice. Altogether, our studies indicate that abolishing\/reducing the deISGylase\/DUB activity of Lpro causes viral attenuation independently of its ability to block the expression of IFN and ISG mRNA. Furthermore, our studies highlight the potential of ISG15 to be developed as a novel biotherapeutic molecule against FMD. IMPORTANCE In this study, we identified an aromatic hydrophobic residue in foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) leader proteinase (Lpro) (W105) that is involved in the interaction with ISG15. Mutation in Lpro W105 (A12-LproW105A) resulted in reduced deISGylation in vitro and in porcine-infected cells. Impaired deISGylase activity correlated with viral attenuation in vitro and in vivo and did not affect the ability of Lpro to block expression of type I interferon (IFN) and other IFN-stimulated genes. Moreover, overexpression of ISG15 resulted in the reduction of FMDV viral titers.

To further investigate the role of hybrid ISG15-Ub chains, the pure homogeneous material of these chains is needed in workable quantities. By applying advanced chemical strategies for protein synthesis, we report the total chemical synthesis of a 231-residue ISG15-Lys29-Ub hybrid chain. During the synthesis we encountered insoluble peptide fragments, and therefore we developed a new reversible Acm based solubilizing tag to efficiently tackle this hurdle.

However, the antiviral functions of IFITMs against fish viruses remain largely uncertain. In this study, the IFITM3 homolog from orange spotted grouper (EcIFITM3) was cloned and its roles in grouper virus infection were investigated. The full-length cDNA of EcIFITM3 was 737 bp, which was composed of a 16 bp 5\u2032-UTR, a 274 bp 3\u2032-UTR, and a 447 bp ORF. EcIFITM3 encodes a 148-amino-acid polypeptide, which contains five domains, i.e., the N-terminal domain (aa 1\u201365), TM1 (aa 66\u201390), the cytoplasmic domain (aa 91\u2013110), TM2 (aa 111\u2013140), and the C-terminal domain (aa 141\u2013148), and shares 78% and 47% identity with IFITM3 of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) and human (Homo sapiens), respectively. EcIFITM3 mRNA was detected in 12 tissues of healthy groupers, with the highest expression levels in the head kidney. Additionally, the in vitro mRNA levels of EcIFITM3 were significantly upregulated by infection with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) or red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), or treatment with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Subcellular localization analysis showed that EcIFITM3 was mainly distributed in the cell membrane of grouper cells. In vitro, the ectopic expression of EcIFITM3 inhibited SGIV and RGNNV infection, as demonstrated by the reduced severity of the cytopathic effect, decreased virus production, and low levels of viral mRNA and proteins. Consistently, knockdown of EcIFITM3 by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) enhanced SGIV and RGNNV replication. EcIFITM3 overexpression and knockdown experiments both suggested that EcIFITM3 inhibits the infection of SGIV and RGNNV by restricting virus entry.","publish_time":1591747200000,"author_summary":" Zhang, Ya; Huang, Youhua; Wang, Liqun; Huang,<br>Liwei; Zheng, Jiaying; Huang, Xiaohong; Qin, Qiwei","abstract_summary":" Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins<br>(IFITMs) have been identified as important host<br>restriction factors in mammals for the control of infection<br>by multiple viruses.
