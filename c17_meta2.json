Thus, developing surveillance systems for predicting COVID-19 pandemic in an early stage saves millions of lives. In this study, the deep learning algorithm and Holt-trend model is proposed to predict coronavirus. The Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM ) algorithm and Holt-trend were applied to predict confirmed numbers and death cases.

Standard measure performance MSE, RMSE, Mean error and correlation are employed to estimate the results of the proposed models. The empirical results of the LSTM by using correlation metric are 99.94%, 99.94% and 99.91 to predict number of confirmed cases on COVID-19 in three countries.

Knowledge of coronavirus-related risk factors can help countries build more systematic and successful responses to COVID-19 disease outbreak. Here we used Supervised Machine Learning and Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK) techniques to reveal correlates and patterns of COVID-19 Disease outbreak in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Methods: We analyzed time series aggregate data compiled by Johns Hopkins University on the outbreak of COVID-19 disease across SSA. COVID-19 data was merged with additional data on socio-demographic and health indicator survey data for 39 of SSA 48 countries that reported confirmed cases and deaths from coronavirus between February 28, 2020 through March 26, 2020. We used supervised machine learning algorithm, Lasso for variable selection and statistical inference. EBK was used to also create a raster estimating the spatial distribution of COVID-19 disease outbreak. Results: The lasso Cross-fit partialing out predictive model ascertained seven variables significantly associated with the risk of coronavirus infection (i.e. new HIV infections among pediatric, adolescent, and middle-aged adult PLHIV, time (days), pneumococcal conjugate-based vaccine, incidence of malaria and diarrhea treatment). Our study indicates, the doubling time in new coronavirus cases was 3 days. The steady three-day decrease in coronavirus outbreak rate of change (ROC) from 37% on March 23, 2020 to 23% on March 26, 2020 indicates the positive impact of countries' steps to stymie the outbreak. The interpolated maps show that coronavirus is rising every day and appears to be severely confined in South Africa. In the West African region (i.e. Burkina Faso, Ghana, Senegal, CotedIviore, Cameroon, and Nigeria), we predict that new cases and deaths from the virus are most likely to increase. Interpretation: Integrated and efficiently delivered interventions to reduce HIV, pneumonia, malaria and diarrhea, are essential to accelerating global health efforts. Scaling up screening and increasing COVID-19 testing capacity across SSA countries can help provide better understanding on how the pandemic is progressing and possibly ensure a sustained decline in the ROC of coronavirus outbreak.

The effectiveness of these responses is notoriously difficult to quantify as individuals travel, violate policies deliberately or inadvertently, and infect others without themselves being detected. Moreover, the publicly available data on infection rates are themselves unreliable due to limited testing and even possibly under-reporting. In this paper, we attempt to interpret and extrapolate from publicly available data using a mixed first-principles epidemiological equations and data-driven neural network model. Leveraging our neural network augmented model, we focus our analysis on four locales: Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and the United States of America, and compare the role played by the quarantine and isolation measures in each of these countries in controlling the effective reproduction number Rt of the virus. Our results unequivocally indicate that the countries in which rapid government interventions and strict public health measures for quarantine and isolation were implemented were successful in halting the spread of infection and prevent it from exploding exponentially. In the case of Wuhan especially, where the available data were earliest available, we have been able to test the predicting ability of our model by training it from data in the January 24 till March 3 window, and then matching the predictions up to April 1. Even for Italy and South Korea, we have a buffer window of one week (25 March - 1 April) to validate the predictions of our model. In the case of the US, our model captures well the current infected curve growth and predicts a halting of infection spread by 20 April 2020. We further demonstrate that relaxing or reversing quarantine measures right now will lead to an exponential explosion in the infected case count, thus nullifying the role played by all measures implemented in the US since mid March 2020.","publish_time":1586131200000,"author_summary":" Dandekar, Raj; Barbastathis, George","abstract_summary":" Since the first recording of what we now call<br>Covid-19 infection in Wuhan, Hubei province, China on<br>Dec 31, 2019, the disease has spread worldwide and<br>met with a wide variety of social distancing and<br>quarantine policies.

Finally, curve fitting is carried out on the predictions in order to find the distribution that best fits the outputs of the MAE, and to refine the estimates of the peaks of the pandemic.

We propose a system for real-time forecast of the cumulative cases of Covid-19 in Brazil. Study Design Monitoring of all Brazilian cities using oficial information from the National Notification System, from March to May 2020, concentrated on Brazil.io databases. Training and evaluation of ARIMA and other machine learning algorithms for temporal forecasting using correlation indexes (Pearson's, Spearman's, and Kendall's) and RMSE(%). Validation from the relative errors of the following six days. Methods Our developed software, COVID-SGIS, captures information from the 26 states and the Distrito Federal at the Brazil.io database. From these data, ARIMA models are created for the accumulation of confirmed cases and death cases by Covid-19. Finally, six-day forecasts graphs are available for Brazil and for each of its federative units, separately, with a 95% CI. In addition to these predictions, the worst and best scenarios are also presented. Results ARIMA models were generated for Brazil and its 27 federative units. The states of Bahia, Maranhao, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte, Amapa, Rondonia every day of the predictions were in the projection interval. The same happened to the states of Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais, Parana and Santa Catarina. In Brazil, the percentage error between the predicted values and the actual values varied between 2.56% and 6.50%.

The study also built a simple mean aggregated method established on the performance of 3 regression techniques such as Support Vector Regression (SVR, NN, and LR), Neural Network, and Linear Regression. Result: The results showed that COVID-19 disease can correctly be predicted. The result of the prediction shows that COVID-19 ailment could be conveyed through water and air ecological variables and so preventives measures such as social distancing, wearing of mask and hand gloves, staying at home can help to avert the circulation of the sickness thereby resulting in reduced active cases and even mortality. Conclusion: It was established that the projected method outperformed when likened to previously obtainable practical models on the bases of prediction precision. Hence, putting in place the preventive measures can effectively manage the spread of COVID-19, and also the death rate will be reduced and eventually be over in India and other nations.","publish_time":1590451200000,"author_summary":" Ogundokun, R.

Covid-19 may cause fatality especially among elderly, and people with chronic health problems. After human to human transmissions of the disease, it has rapidly spread throughout China, and then the outbreak has reached to neighboring countries in Asia. Now, the spread of the virus is accelerating in the world, and increasing number of new cases has been reported daily in Europe, Middle East, Africa and America regions. Recently, World Health Organization (WHO) also announced Covid-19 as a Pandemic. As of 3 April, worldwide around more than 1 million cases and around 60,000 fatalities are reported. Thus, forecasting regional and worldwide outbreak size of Covid-19 is important in order to take necessary actions regarding to preparedness plans and mitigation interventions. In this work, we design a deep learning model, which is an effective artificial intelligence method, to provide regional and worldwide forecasts. Particularly for worldwide, our approach predicts the cumulative number of cases, cumulative number of deaths and daily new cases. For Europe and Middle East regions, we predict the cumulative number of cases, and for Mainland China we predict daily new cases and the cumulative number of deaths. We predict the next 10 days based on the previously reported actual time series data of Covid-19. For worldwide forecasts, we use the data provided by Worldometers. For Europe and Middle East forecasts, we use the data provided by World Health Organization, and for China Mainland forecasts, the data is obtained from Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. This is the first time that a deep learning model has been employed for Covid-19 spread prediction, solely based on the known reported cases of Covid-19. The proposed deep learning architecture consists of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layer, dropout layer, and fully connected layers to predict regional and worldwide forecasts. We evaluate our approach with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric. For forecasting, we use the network models that give the minimum RMSE on the last 3 days of actual data. Networks, which achieves the minimum RMSE on the last 3 days, are used to predict the next 10 days. Every day, the spread and situations are changing. Our approach can take into account these real-time changes; the deep learning model can be re-trained with new daily data and perform real-time forecasting. Results show that the proposed deep learning model is promising, it can predict possible scenarios regionally and globally for the spread of Covid-19.","publish_time":1590451200000,"author_summary":" Direkoglu, C.; Sah, M.","abstract_summary":" In December 2019, Covid-19 epidemic was<br>identified in Wuhan, China.

Methods: The study used data of COVID 19 confirmed cases in India and Thailand from WHO COVID 19 situation reports during the time period between 25th March, 2020 and 14th May, 2020. After determination of stationarity in the data and differencing, observation of autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF), Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) (2,2,1) model was used to forecast the COVID 19 confirmed cases in both these countries for two weeks (i.e. 28th May, 2020).

RESULTS We forecasted curves of cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 across China from Jan 20, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Using the multiple-step forecasting, the estimated average errors of 6-step, 7-step, 8-step, 9-step and 10-step forecasting were 1.64%, 2.27%, 2.14%, 2.08%, 0.73%, respectively.

Therefore, it is important to forecast the number of new cases in a time window of one week, once this can help the public health system developing strategic planning to deals with the COVID-19. The application of the forecasting artificial intelligence (AI) models has the potential of deal with dynamical behavior of time-series like of COVID-19. In this paper, Bayesian regression neural network, cubist regression, k-nearest neighbors, quantile random forest, and support vector regression, are used stand-alone, and coupled with the recent pre-processing variational mode decomposition (VMD) employed to decompose the time series into several intrinsic mode functions. All AI techniques are evaluated in the task of time-series forecasting with one, three, and six-days-ahead the cumulative COVID-19 cases in five Brazilian and American states, with a high number of cases up to April 28th, 2020. Previous cumulative COVID-19 cases and exogenous variables as daily temperature and precipitation were employed as inputs for all forecasting models.

In general, the hybridization of VMD outperformed single forecasting models regarding the accuracy, specifically when the horizon is six-days-ahead, the hybrid VMD\u2013single models achieved better accuracy in 70% of the cases. Regarding the exogenous variables, the importance ranking as predictor variables is, from the upper to the lower, past cases, temperature, and precipitation.

In the present study, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) models are applied to the data consisting of daily confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the most affected five countries of the world for modeling and predicting one-month confirmed cases of this disease. To validate these models, the prediction results were tested by comparing it with testing data. The results revealed better accuracy of the LS-SVM model over the ARIMA model and also suggested a rapid rise of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases in all the countries under study. This analysis would help governments to take necessary actions in advance associated with the preparation of isolation wards, availability of medicines and medical staff, a decision on lockdown, training of volunteers, and economic plans.","publish_time":1593820800000,"author_summary":" Singh, Sarbjit; Parmar, Kulwinder Singh;<br>Makkhan, Sidhu Jitendra Singh; Kaur, Jatinder;<br>Peshoria, Shruti; Kumar, Jatinder","abstract_summary":" Discussions about the recently identified<br>deadly coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which<br>originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019 are common<br>around the globe now.
