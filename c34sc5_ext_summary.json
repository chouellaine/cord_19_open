the world.(1) Number of the patients of all age groups has increased significantly.(2) In order to curb the spread of the epidemic, thousands of health care workers (HCWs) have joined the front line of the fight against this highly contagious disease.(3) When taking care of patients with COVID\u201019 pneumonia, HCWs must first protect themselves by performing adequate hand hygiene and using protective equipment including medical mask, goggles/face shield, gown and gloves.(4) However, the wearing of these personal protective equipment (PPE) on a daily basis and the frequent use of hand disinfectants often cause skin problems which could reduce their enthusiasm for overloaded work and make them anxious at all stages of the pandemic.Being the front line warriors, health care professionals are susceptible to various skin conditions due to prolonged use of personal protective equipment.Among the basic protective measures against COVID-19, the need to wash hands frequently and in a prolonged way using soap, and to regularly use alcohol-based hand sanitizers is well established for the whole population.Although use of personal protective equipment is a critical strategy to protect health care personnel from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), other strategies also need to be implemented on labor and delivery units to reduce the risk of health care\u2013associated transmission, including screening of all pregnant women who present for care (case identification), placing a mask on and rapidly isolating ill pregnant women, and minimizing the number of personnel who enter the room of an ill patient (physical distancing).The incidence of adverse skin reactions to the N95 mask was 95.1%, that to latex gloves was 88.5%, and that to protective clothing was
