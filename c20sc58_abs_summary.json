{"cluster": 20, "subcluster": 58, "abstract_summ": " The detection of serum antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is emerging as a new tool for the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis . Since many coronaviruses are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of samples at 56\u00b0C prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of transmission . Heat inactivation prior to immunoanalysis is not recommended ."}
