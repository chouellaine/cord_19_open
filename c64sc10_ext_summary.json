We also biochemically characterized their relative stabilities and affinities for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2.These observations suggest that cleavage at the furin-cleavage site decreases the overall stability of SARS-CoV-2 S and facilitates the adoption of the open conformation that is required for S to bind to the ACE2 receptor.We further demonstrate that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, which correlates with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans.", "title_summ": "Structure, function and antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteinSpike protein recognition of mammalian ACE2 predicts the host range and an optimized ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 infectionRole of the GTNGTKR motif in the N-terminal receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteinStructure, Function, and Antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike GlycoproteinMolecular simulation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to pangolin ACE2 or human ACE2 natural variants reveals altered susceptibility to infection.SARS-CoV-2 and bat RaTG13 spike glycoprotein structures inform on virus evolution and furin-cleavage effects.", "title_abstract_phrases": "Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal antibodies potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S mediated entry into cells, indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination.Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal sera potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry into target cells, thereby indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination.We determined cryo-EM structures for RaTG13 S and for both furin-cleaved and uncleaved SARS-CoV-2 S; we compared these with recently reported structures for uncleaved SARS-CoV-2 S.
