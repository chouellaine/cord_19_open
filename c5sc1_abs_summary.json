{"cluster": 5, "subcluster": 1, "abstract_summ": " In the United Kingdom, old infrastructure facilities along train tracks like overpasses should be repaired as soon as possible . In the conventional Sliding Mesh approach, sliding planes must be completely adjacent to other Sliding planes . In this study, a traveling train and a stationary overpass were reproduced in a computational domain . The results were compared with experimental results given by Baker ."}
