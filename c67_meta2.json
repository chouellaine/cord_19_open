This article translates organisational scholarship on professionals working in organisations to elucidate why traditional approaches to supporting employee mental health, which often ask employees to seek assistance from centralised resources that separate mental health personnel from frontline units, may be insufficient under crisis conditions. We identify a critical but often overlooked aspect of employee mental health support: how frontline professionals respond to mental health services. In high-risk, high-pressure fields, frontline professionals may perceive mental health support as coming at the expense of urgent frontline work goals (ie, patient care) and as clashing with their central professional identities (ie, as expert, self-reliant ironmen\/women). FINDINGS: To address these pervasive goal and identity conflicts in professional organisations, we translate the results of a multiyear research study examining the US Army\u2019s efforts to transform its mental health support during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We highlight parallels between providing support to frontline military units and frontline healthcare units during COVID-19 and surface implications for structuring mental health supports during a crisis. We describe how an intentional organisational design used by the US Army that assigned specific mental health personnel to frontline units helped to mitigate professional goal and identity conflicts by creating personalised relationships and contextualising mental health offerings. CONCLUSION: Addressing frontline caregivers\u2019 mental health needs is a vital part of health delivery organisations\u2019 response to COVID-19, but without thoughtful organisational design, well-intentioned efforts may fall short. An approach that assigns individual mental health personnel to support specific frontline units may be particularly promising.","publish_time":1591056000000,"author_summary":" DiBenigno, Julia; Kerrissey, Michaela","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: Although the COVID-19 pandemic<br>exposes frontline caregivers to severe prolonged<br>stresses and trauma, there has been little clarity on how<br>healthcare organisations can structure support to<br>address these mental health needs.

Citizens, for instance, need to cope with guidelines on social interaction, work, home isolation, and symptom recognition. Additionally, healthcare providers and policymakers need to manage unprecedented and unpredictable pressure on the healthcare system. Providing citizens with an app gives them access to the latest information and enables them to assess their own health. These data could be used to support policymakers and healthcare providers to obtain valuable insights into the regional distribution of infection load and healthcare consumption. OBJECTIVE The primary aim was to assess people's usage of an app that supports them by providing COVID-19 education, self-assessment and health monitoring for a 7-day period. In addition, we aimed to assess how this data would be useful for healthcare providers and policymakers by applying it to an interactive map and combining it with hospital data. The secondary outcomes of the study were users' satisfaction with the information provided by the app, its perceived usefulness, details about the healthcare providers they contacted, and the follow-up actions from such contact. METHODS This observational cohort study was conducted at the nonacademic teaching hospital \"Elisabeth Twee Steden\" (ETZ) in Tilburg, the Netherlands. From April 1, 2020 onward, ETZ offered COVID-19 education, self-assessment and a symptom tracking diary to their already existing app for patient education and monitoring. RESULTS Between April 1 and April 20, 2020, a total of 6194 people downloaded the app. The self-assessment functionality was used often to check one's health status. In total, 5104 people responded to the question about severe symptoms, of which 242 indicated experiencing them. A total of 4929 people responded to the question regarding mild symptoms, of which 3248 indicated that they suffered from these symptoms (65.9%). The data were successfully applied to an interactive map displaying user demographics and health status. Furthermore, we were able to link the app user's data to the clinical data on a postal code level. App users were satisfied with the information in the app (mean 8, 0-10 scale) and appreciated the symptom diary functionality (mean 8, 0-10 scale). In total, 102 users contacted a healthcare provider, which subsequently led to 91 contacts. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated the successful implementation and use of an app with COVID-19 education, self-assessment, and a 7-day symptom diary. Overall, users were satisfied with the information supplied through the app and appreciated its functionality. Data collected with the app were successfully applied to an interactive map displaying postal code specific demographics, health status, and healthcare consumption. These data could be used to support policymakers and healthcare providers to obtain valuable insights into the regional distribution of infection load and healthcare consumption.

Most child and adolescent psychiatry training programs have not integrated TMH into their curricula and are ill equipped to respond during crises to their patients' needs. In this study, we present the implementation of a home-based TMH (HB-TMH) service during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We describe the technological, administrative, training, and clinical implementation components involved in transitioning a comprehensive outpatient child and adolescent psychiatry program to a HB-TMH virtual clinic. Results: The transition was accomplished in 6 weeks. Most in-clinic services were rapidly moved off campus to the home. Owing to challenges encountered with each implementation component, phone sessions bridged the transition from in-clinic to reliable virtual appointments. Within 3 weeks (March 20, 2020) of planning for HB-TMH, 67% of all appointments were conducted at home, and within 4 weeks (March 27, 2020), 90% were conducted at home. By week 6 (April 3, 2020), reliable HB-TMH appointments were implemented. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic crisis created the opportunity to innovate a solution to disrupted care for our established patients and to create a resource for youth who developed problems during the crisis. Our department was experienced in providing TMH services that facilitated the transition to HB-TMH, yet still had to overcome known and unanticipated challenges.

Face-to-face healthcare, including psychiatric provision, must continue despite reduced interpersonal contact during the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) pandemic. Community-based services might use domiciliary visits, consultations in healthcare settings, or remote consultations. Services might also alter direct contact between clinicians. Aims. We examined the effects of appointment types and clinician-clinician encounters upon infection rates. Methods. We modelled a COVID-19-like disease in a hypothetical community healthcare team, their patients, and patients' household contacts (family). In one condition, clinicians met patients and briefly met family (e.g. home visit or collateral history). In another, patients attended alone (e.g. clinic visit), segregated from each other. In another, face-to-face contact was eliminated (e.g. videoconferencing). We also varied clinician-clinician contact; baseline and ongoing \"external\" infection rates; whether overt symptoms reduced transmission risk behaviourally (e.g. via personal protective equipment, PPE); and household clustering. Results. Service organization had minimal effects on whole-population infection under our assumptions but materially affected clinician infection. Appointment type and inter-clinician contact had greater effects at low external infection rates and without a behavioural symptom response. Clustering magnified the effect of appointment type. We discuss infection control and other factors affecting appointment choice and team organization. Conclusions. Distancing between clinicians can have significant effects on team infection. Loss of clinicians to infection likely has an adverse impact on care, not modelled here. Appointments must account for clinical necessity as well as infection control. Interventions to reduce transmission risk can synergize, arguing for maximal distancing and behavioural measures (e.g. PPE) consistent with safe care.","publish_time":1588464000000,"author_summary":" Cardinal, R.

These groups are led by attending psychiatrists and psychiatry residents. In addition, we also deployed a system of telehealth individual counseling by attending psychiatrists. RESULTS: Anxiety was high in the beginning of our weekly groups, dealing with fear of contracting COVID or spreading COVID to family members, and the stress of social distancing. Later the focus was also on the impairment of the traditional clinician patient relationship by the characteristics of this disease, and the associated moral challenges and trauma. Clinicians were helped to cope with these issues through group processes such as ventilation of feelings, peer support, consensual validation, and peer-learning, and interventions by group facilitators. People with severe anxiety or desiring confidentiality were helped through individual interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that this method of offering telehealth peer support groups and individual counseling is a useful model for other centers to adapt, to emotionally support frontline clinical workers in this ongoing worldwide crisis.","publish_time":1592870400000,"author_summary":" Viswanathan, Ramaswamy; Myers, Michael;<br>Fanous, Ayman","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic has<br>put an enormous stress on the mental health of<br>frontline healthcare workers.

The letter is written by members of the CAREWELL team, a HRB-funded project that aims to promote health and self-care behaviours among working family carers. Family carers provide care to family and friends in the community who need support due to old-age, disability and chronic illness. In many cases, family carers are supporting those who are considered most at risk in this pandemic meaning carers must reduce their own risk of infection in order to protect their dependent family members. The temporary reduction of some home care services, as well as school and creche closures, means that family carers are providing increased levels of care with little or no support. At a time when both worlds of work and care have been dramatically transformed, we wish to shed light on those who are currently balancing paid employment with a family caregiving role. We argue that there is much to be learned from the recent work restrictions that could benefit employees, including working family carers, beyond this pandemic. We also wish to build on the potential positives of a transformed society and encourage policy makers and employers to focus on what is currently being implemented, and to identify which measures could be used to create a bedrock of policies and practices that would offer robust and effective support to family carers. It is hoped that family carers will receive greater recognition for the significant role they play in society, providing essential care and alleviating the strain on health and social care systems, both during and post the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":1589500800000,"author_summary":" Phillips, Dominique; Paul, Gillian; Fahy,<br>Majella; Dowling-Hetherington, Linda; Kroll, Thilo;<br>Moloney, Breda; Duffy, Clare; Fealy, Gerard; Lafferty,<br>Attracta","abstract_summary":" This is an open letter to acknowledge the<br>essential and increasingly challenging role unpaid<br>family carers are playing in the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>The letter is written by members of the CAREWELL<br>team, a HRB-funded project that aims to promote<br>health and self-care behaviours among working family<br>carers.

In our country, the increasing life expectancy (80.5 for males and 84.9 for females, with a total life expectancy of 82.9) has led to very positive consequences for health and the well-being of elderly people: a very high number of older adults lives and acts independently in their daily life, even if they have one or more than one chronic disease. In the time of COVID-19\u2032s outbreak in Italy, the focus of the media was on elderly people for two main reasons. First, many older people demonstrated a very high civic sense and they were helping society to fight against the pandemic. Second, also in Italy, like in China, the older adults are at higher risk in being infected with COVID-19 and if they get ill, they have a higher risk of death. The balance previously achieved between age-related disorders and a good quality of life and good health is now under high pressure. It is very important to protect elderly people from infection, but also it is important to respect them and to support them in this complex situation. There is a great risk of \u201cageism\u201d.
