{"cluster": 36, "subcluster": 61, "abstract_summ": " From critical COVID\u201019 to the convalescent stage, early lymphopenia was improved (median: 0.6 \u00d7 10(9) L(\u22121) vs. 0.9 \u00d7 10L(+1), P = 0.009), and an obvious fluctuation in WBC and neutrophil counts was observed . CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, cytokines and HLA\u2010G(+) immune cells are associated with the natural history of the critical patient; however, future studies are necessary ."}
