Translational challenges include restoring hMSC efficacy following cryopreservation, developing effective xenogeneic-free (XF) hMSCs and establishing true therapeutic potential at a clinically relevant time point of administration. We wished to determine whether cytokine pre-activation of cryopreserved, bone marrow-derived XF-hMSCs would enhance their capacity to facilitate injury resolution following VILI and elucidate mechanisms of action. METHODS: Initially, in vitro studies examined the potential for the secretome from cytokine pre-activated XF-hMSCs to attenuate pulmonary epithelial injury induced by cyclic mechanical stretch. Later, anaesthetised rats underwent VILI and, 6 h following injury, were randomized to receive 1 \u00d7 10(7) XF-hMSC\/kg that were (i) naive fresh, (ii) naive cryopreserved, (iii) cytokine pre-activated fresh or (iv) cytokine pre-activated cryopreserved, while control animals received (v) vehicle. The extent of injury resolution was measured at 24 h after injury. Finally, the role of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) in mediating the effect of pre-activated XF-hMSCs was determined in a pulmonary epithelial wound repair model. RESULTS: Pre-activation enhanced the capacity of the XF-hMSC secretome to decrease stretch-induced pulmonary epithelial inflammation and injury. Both pre-activated fresh and cryopreserved XF-hMSCs enhanced resolution of injury following VILI, restoring oxygenation, improving lung compliance, reducing lung leak and improving resolution of lung structural injury. Finally, the secretome of pre-activated XF-hMSCs enhanced epithelial wound repair, in part via a KGF-dependent mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: Cytokine pre-activation enhanced the capacity of cryopreserved, XF-hMSCs to promote injury resolution following VILI, potentially via a KGF-dependent mechanism.","publish_time":1580860800000,"author_summary":" Horie, Shahd; Gaynard, Sean; Murphy, Mary;<br>Barry, Frank; Scully, Michael; O\u2019Toole, Daniel;<br>Laffey, John G.","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: Human mesenchymal stem\/stromal<br>cells (hMSCs) represent a promising therapeutic<br>strategy for ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and<br>acute respiratory distress syndrome.<br>Translational challenges include restoring hMSC efficacy<br>following cryopreservation, developing effective<br>xenogeneic-free (XF) hMSCs and establishing true therapeutic<br>potential at a clinically relevant time point of<br>administration.

Remarkable progress has been made in attenuating the inflammatory injury associated with ALI using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based cell and gene therapy. However, to date, the benefits of interleukin-35 (IL-35)-modified MSCs in ALI intervention have not been investigated. In the present study, adult male C57BL\/6 mice randomly received intravenous infusion of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) constitutively expressing IL-35 (IL-35-GFP-ADSCs) or GFP (GFP-ADSCs) via retrovirus-mediated transduction (8 \u00d7 10(5) cells per mice) or isotonic saline 7 days before ALI modeling to investigate the effect and related mechanism. ALI was performed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhalation for 24 h. Normal mice served as the sham group. The results indicated that compared with GFP-ADSCs, IL-35-modified ADSCs significantly increased cellular and pulmonary IL-10 and IL-35 production. Pretreatment with IL-35-ADSCs markedly reduced body weight loss, pulmonary wet\/dry weight ratio and pathological injury. The PO(2) was rescued to normal levels in mice that received IL-35-ADSCs. IL-35-ADSCs infusion apparently inhibited IL-6 release, protein leakage and MPO activity but greatly elevated IL-35 level in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Splenic regulatory T cells in IL-35-ADSCs-pretreated mice got effective increase. Moreover, IL-35-ADSCs pretreatment remarkably inhibited neutrophil and macrophage infiltration and greatly decreased IL-6, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression. In conclusion, pretreatment with IL-35-engineered ADSCs provided effective protection against LPS-induced ALI through suppression of pulmonary inflammation and, thus, might be a promising strategy to improve outcomes after ALI. The enhanced paracrine and immunosuppressive capacity of IL-35-ADSCs might contribute to their beneficial effects. However, further studies are needed to illuminate the detailed mechanism.","publish_time":1584057600000,"author_summary":" Zhang, Xiaoning; Zhang, Zhiqiang; Ju,<br>Mingyan; Li, Jiaci; Jing, Yaqing; Zhao, Yuxia; Gu, Chao;<br>Dong, Ming; Li, Guang; Liu, Yi","abstract_summary":" Acute lung injury (ALI)-triggered pulmonary<br>injury has been associated with high mortality,<br>despite advances in drug treatment and supportive<br>therapy.

This human coronavirus (HCov-19) has put the world on high alert as the numbers of confirmed cases are continuously increasing. The world is now fighting against this deadly virus and is leaving no stone unturned to find effective treatments through testing of various available drugs, including those effective against flu, malaria, etc. With an urgent need for the development of potential strategies, two recent studies from China using Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) to treat COVID-19 pneumonia have shed some light on a potential cure for the COVID-19 infected patients. However, MSCs, despite being used in various other clinical trials have always been questioned for their tendency to aggregate or form clumps in the injured or disease microenvironment. It has also been reported in various studies that exosomes secreted by these MSCs, contribute towards the cell\u2019s biological and therapeutic efficacy. There have been reports evaluating the safety and feasibility of these exosomes in various lung diseases, thereby proposing them as a cell-free therapeutic agent. Also, attractive features like cell targeting, low-immunogenicity, safety, and high biocompatibility distinguish these exosomes from other synthetic nano-vesicles and thus potentiate their role as a drug delivery nano-platform. Building upon these observations, herein, efforts are made to give an overview of stem cell-derived exosomes as an appealing therapeutic agent and drug delivery nano-carrier. In this review, we briefly recapitulate the recent evidence and developments in understanding exosomes as a promising candidate for novel nano-intervention in the current pandemic scenario. Furthermore, this review will highlight and discuss mechanistic role of exosomes to combat severe lung pathological conditions. We have also attempted to dwell into the nano-formulation of exosomes for its better applicability, storage, and stability thereby conferring them as off the shelf therapeutic.","publish_time":1594598400000,"author_summary":" Pinky; Gupta, Suchi; Krishnakumar, Vishnu;<br>Sharma, Yashvi; Dinda, Amit Kumar; Mohanty, Sujata","abstract_summary":" The recent pandemic situation transpired due<br>to coronavirus novel strain SARS-CoV-2 has<br>become a global concern.

In this study, we compare the ability of rat dASCs and native SCs to produce NGF in vitro. We also evaluate the ability of muscarinic receptors, in particular the M2 subtype, to modulate NGF production and maturation from the precursor (proNGF) to the mature (mNGF) form. For the first time, we demonstrate that dASCs produce higher basal levels of proNGF and mature NGF compared to SCs. Moreover, muscarinic receptor activation, and in particular M2 subtype stimulation, modulates NGF production and maturation in both SCs and dASCs. Indeed, both cell types express both proNGF A and B isoforms, as well as mNGF. After M2 receptor stimulation, proNGF-B (25 kDa), which is involved in apoptotic processes, is strongly reduced at transcript and protein level. Thus, we demonstrate that dASCs possess a stronger neurotrophic potential compared to SCs. ACh, via M2 muscarinic receptors, contributes to the modulation and maturation of NGF, improving the regenerative properties of dASCs.","publish_time":1588032000000,"author_summary":" Piovesana, R; Faroni, A; Taggi, M; Matera, A;<br>Soligo, M; Canipari, R; Manni, L; Reid, A J; Tata, A M","abstract_summary":" Regenerative capability of the peripheral<br>nervous system after injury is enhanced by Schwann<br>cells (SCs) producing several growth factors.

These analyses show that peripheral nerves make many ligands predicted to act on peripheral and central nervous system neurons, including known and previously uncharacterized ligands. While Schwann cells are an important ligand source within injured nerves, more than half of the predicted ligands are made by nerve-resident mesenchymal cells, including the endoneurial cells most closely associated with peripheral axons. At least three of these mesenchymal ligands, ANGPT1, CCL11 and VEGFC, promote growth when locally applied on sympathetic axons.

Here, we used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to reveal that Schwann cells and, surprisingly, nerve mesenchymal cells are primary sources of ligands in the injured nerve. We then combined injured nerve scRNA-seq data with proteomic and transcriptomic data from sensory and sympathetic neurons and used a systems-biology\/modeling approach to predict novel mesenchymal cell-derived factors that may promote peripheral axon growth.

Further, inference of cell-cell interactions highlight a macrophage-fibroblast-cardiomyocyte network that differs between atria and ventricles, and compared to skeletal muscle.

Accordingly, directing stem cell differentiation could provide a tractable approach to alter the abundance or quality of specialized cells of the small intestinal epithelium, including the secretory Paneth, goblet, and enteroendocrine populations. Yet, to date, there has been a lack of suitable tools and rigorous approaches to identify biological targets and pharmacological agents that can modify epithelial composition to enable causal testing of disease-associated changes with novel therapeutic candidates. To empower the search for epithelia-modifying agents, we establish a first-of-its-kind high-throughput phenotypic organoid screen. We demonstrate the ability to screen thousands of samples and uncover biological targets and associated small molecule inhibitors which translate to in vivo. This approach is enabled by employing a functional, cell-type specific, scalable assay on an organoid model designed to represent the physiological cues of in vivo Paneth cell differentiation from adult intestinal stem cells. Further, we miniaturize and adapt the organoid culture system to enable automated plating and screening, thereby providing the ability to test thousands of samples. Strikingly, in our screen we identify inhibitors of the nuclear exporter Xpo1 modulate stem cell fate commitment by inducing a pan-epithelial stress response combined with an interruption of mitogen signaling in cycling intestinal progenitors, thereby significantly increasing the abundance of Paneth cells independent of known WNT and Notch differentiation cues. We extend our observation in vivo, demonstrating that oral administration of Xpo1 inhibitor KPT-330 at doses 1,000-fold lower than conventionally used in hematologic malignancies increases Paneth cell abundance.

However, LSC dynamics, heterogeneity and genetic signature are largely unknown. Moreover, recent accumulating evidence strongly suggested that epithelial SCs are actually abundant, frequently dividing cells that display stochastic behavior. In this work, we performed an in-depth analysis of the murine limbal epithelium by single-cell RNA sequencing and quantitative lineage tracing. The generated data provided an atlas of cell states of the corneal epithelial lineage, and particularly, revealed the co-existence of two novel LSC populations that reside in separate and well-defined sub-compartments. In the \u201couter\u201d limbus, we identified a primitive widespread population of quiescent LSCs (qLSCs) that uniformly express Krt15\/Gpha2\/Ifitm3\/Cd63 proteins, while the \u201cinner\u201d limbus host prevalent active LSCs (aLSCs) co-expressing Krt15-GFP\/Atf3\/Mt1-2\/Socs3. Analysis of LSC population dynamics suggests that while qLSCs and aLSCs possess different proliferation rates, they both follow similar stochastic rules that dictate their self-renewal and differentiation. Finally, T cells were distributed in close proximity to qLSCs. Indeed, their absence or inhibition resulted in the loss of quiescence and delayed wound healing.

COVID-19 is a serious illness leading to multiple deaths in various countries including the United States. Several million Americans satisfy the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for being high risk. Unfortunately, the available supply of medical beds and equipment for mechanical ventilation are much less than is projected to be needed. The World Health Organization (WHO) and multiple agencies led by the CDC in the United States have attempted to organize intensive outbreak investigation programs utilizing appropriate preventive measures, evaluation, and treatment. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic forms to conditions encompassing multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) syndromes. The presently approved treatments are supportive but not curative for the disease. There are multiple treatments being studied. These include vaccines, medications Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine and potentially combination therapy. Finally, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells or (UC-MSCs) may have a role and are being studied. The cure of COVID-19 is essentially dependent on the patients' own immune system. When the immune system is over activated in an attempt to kill the virus, this can lead to the production of a large number of inflammatory factors, resulting in severe cytokine storm. The cytokine storm may induce organ damage followed by the edema, dysfunction of air exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and secondary infection, which may lead to death. Thus, at this point, the avoidance of the cytokine storm may be the key for the treatment of HCOV-19 infected patients.In China, where there was limited availability of effective modalities to manage COVID-19 several patients were treated with expanded UC-MSCs. Additionally, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care have reported guidelines to treat coronavirus patients with stem cells in the hope of decreasing the number of patients going to the ICU, and, also relatively quickly getting them out of ICU. In this manuscript, we describe the urgent need for various solutions, pathogenesis of coronavirus and the clinical evidence for treatment of COVID-19 with stem cells. The limited but emerging evidence regarding UC MSC in managing COVID-19 suggests that it might be considered for compassionate use in critically ill patients to reduce morbidity and mortality in the United States. The administration and Coronavirus Task Force might wish to approach the potential of expanded UC-MSCs as an evolutionary therapeutic strategy in managing COVID-19 illness with a 3-pronged approach: If proven safe and effective on a specific and limited basis\u20261.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is typically associated with fever and respiratory symptoms. It often progresses to severe respiratory distress and multi-organ failure which carry a high mortality rate. Older patients or those with medical comorbidities are at greater risk for severe disease. Inflammation, pulmonary edema and an over-reactive immune response can lead to hypoxia, respiratory distress and lung damage. Mesenchymal stromal\/stem cells (MSCs) possess potent and broad-ranging immunomodulatory activities. Multiple in vivo studies in animal models and ex vivo human lung models have demonstrated the MSC\u2019s impressive capacity to inhibit lung damage, reduce inflammation, dampen immune responses and aid with alveolar fluid clearance. Additionally, MSCs produce molecules that are antimicrobial and reduce pain. Upon administration by the intravenous route, the cells travel directly to the lungs where the majority are sequestered, a great benefit for the treatment of pulmonary disease. The in vivo safety of local and intravenous administration of MSCs has been demonstrated in multiple human clinical trials, including studies of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Recently, the application of MSCs in the context of ongoing COVID-19 disease and other viral respiratory illnesses has demonstrated reduced patient mortality and, in some cases, improved long-term pulmonary function. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASC), an abundant type of MSC, are proposed as a therapeutic option for the treatment of COVID-19 in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. Additionally, when proven to be safe and effective, ASC treatments may reduce the demand on critical hospital resources.

METHODS: Thirteen COVID-19 adult patients under invasive mechanical ventilation who had received previous antiviral and\/or anti-inflammatory treatments (including steroids, lopinavir\/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine and\/or tocilizumab, among others) were treated with allogeneic AT-MSC. Ten patients received two doses, with the second dose administered a median of 3 days (interquartile range-IQR- 1 day) after the first one. Two patients received a single dose and another patient received 3 doses. Median number of cells per dose was 0.98 \u00d7 10(6) (IQR 0.50 \u00d7 10(6)) AT-MSC\/kg of recipient's body weight. Potential adverse effects related to cell infusion and clinical outcome were assessed. Additional parameters analyzed included changes in imaging, analytical and inflammatory parameters. FINDINGS: First dose of AT-MSC was administered at a median of 7 days (IQR 12 days) after mechanical ventilation. No adverse events were related to cell therapy. With a median follow-up of 16 days (IQR 9 days) after the first dose, clinical improvement was observed in nine patients (70%). Seven patients were extubated and discharged from ICU while four patients remained intubated (two with an improvement in their ventilatory and radiological parameters and two in stable condition). Two patients died (one due to massive gastrointestinal bleeding unrelated to MSC therapy). Treatment with AT-MSC was followed by a decrease in inflammatory parameters (reduction in C-reactive protein, IL-6, ferritin, LDH and d-dimer) as well as an increase in lymphocytes, particularly in those patients with clinical improvement.

Methods: Platelet lysates were prepared by freeze-thawing of pathogen-reduced (Intercept\u00ae) PCs suspended in 65% storage solution (SPP+) and 35% plasma, and by serum-conversion of PCs suspended in 100% plasma. Lysates were added to the MSC growth media at 10% (v\/v), filtered, and subjected to cascade nanofiltration on 35 and 19-nm Planova filters. Media supplemented with 10% starting platelet lysates or FBS were used as the controls. Impacts of nanofiltration on the growth media composition, removal of platelet extracellular vesicles (PEVs), and MSC expansion were evaluated. Results: Nanofiltration did not detrimentally affect contents of total protein and growth factors, or the biochemical composition. The clearance factor of PEVs was over 3 log values. Expansion, of proliferation, membrane markers, differentiation potential, and immunosuppressive properties of cells in nanofiltered media were consistently better than those expanded in FBS-supplemented media. Compared to FBS, chondrogenesis and osteogenesis genes were expressed more in nanofiltered media, and there were fewer senescent cells over six passages. Conclusions: Nanofiltration of growth media supplemented with two types of platelet lysates, including one prepared from pathogen-reduced PCs, is technically feasible. These data support the possibility of developing pathogen-reduced xeno-free growth media for clinical-grade propagation of human cells.","publish_time":1588896000000,"author_summary":" Barro, Lassina; Nebie, Ouada; Chen,<br>Ming-Sheng; Wu, Yu-Wen; Koh, Mickey BC; Knutson, Folke;<br>Watanabe, Naoto; Takahara, Masayasu; Burnouf, Thierry","abstract_summary":" Abstract Background and aims: Human platelet<br>lysate can replace fetal bovine serum (FBS) for<br>xeno-free ex vivo expansion of mesenchymal stromal cells<br>(MSCs), but pooling of platelet concentrates (PCs)<br>increases risks of pathogen transmission.
