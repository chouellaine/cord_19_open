These results suggest that these neutralizing human antibodies from the patient-derived antibody libraries have the potential to become therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants in this global pandemic.Several of these antibodies were able to potently inhibit live SARS-CoV-2 infection at concentrations as low as 0.007 \u00b5g/mL, making them the most potent human SARS-CoV-2 antibodies described to date.Altogether, we showed that human neutralizing antibodies could be efficiently discovered by high-throughput single B-cell sequencing in response to pandemic infectious diseases.Experience with SARS and MERS coronavirus has shown that potent monoclonal neutralizing antibodies against the RBD can inhibit the interaction with the virus cellular receptor (ACE2 for SARS) and block the virus cell entry.To gain a deeper understanding of cross-neutralizing antibody responses, we mined the memory B cell repertoire of a convalescent SARS donor and identified 200 SARS-CoV-2

These results suggest that these neutralizing human antibodies from the patient-derived antibody libraries have the potential to become therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants in this global pandemic.Based on these criteria, we selected pairs of highly-potent individual antibodies that simultaneously bind the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, providing ideal partners for a therapeutic antibody cocktail that aims to decrease the potential for virus escape mutants that might arise in response to selective pressure from a single antibody treatment.Our strategy can efficiently isolate the blocking antibodies of RBD, and it would speed up the discovery of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.A non-competing pair of human neutralizing antibodies block COVID-19 virus binding to its receptor ACE2Neutralizing antibodies could be antivirals against COVID-19 pandemics.These data illuminate structural principles of antibody cooperativity with implications for development of antiviral immunotherapeutics.Several of these antibodies were able to potently inhibit live SARS-CoV-2 infection at concentrations as low as 0.007 \u00b5g/mL, making them the most potent human SARS-CoV-2 antibodies described to date."}
