These surviving OLs express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and other genes associated with an inflammatory response.", "title_summ": "Oligodendrocytes that survive acute coronavirus infection induce prolonged inflammatory responses in the CNS.Update on T cells in the virally infected brain: friends and foesType I astrocytes and microglia induce a cytokine response in an encephalitic murine coronavirus infectionMicroglia influence host defense, disease, and repair following murine coronavirus infection of the central nervous systemT cell engagement of cross-presenting microglia protects the brain from a nasal virus infection.", "title_abstract_phrases": "Cytokine secretion by type I astrocytes and microglia, as part of the brain's glymphatic and innate immune system, contributes to the pathogenesis of an encephalitic coronavirus infection, and indicates the rationale for anti-cytokine therapies for COVID-19.Microglia influence host defense, disease, and repair following murine coronavirus infection of the central nervous systemThe present study examines functional contributions of microglia in host defense, demyelination, and remyelination following infection of susceptible mice with a neurotropic coronavirus.Update on T cells in the virally infected brain: friends and foesThe present review will outline neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects of central nervous system (CNS) infiltrating T cells during viral infections.T cell engagement of cross-presenting microglia protects the brain from a nasal virus infection.Treatment with PLX5622, an inhibitor of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) that efficiently depletes microglia, prior to infection of the central nervous system (CNS) with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) resulted in increased mortality compared with control mice that correlated with impaired control of viral replication.Collectively, these data demonstrate that microglia provide a front-line defense against a neuroinvasive nasal infection by cross-presenting antigen to antiviral T cells that noncytolytically cleanse neurons."}
