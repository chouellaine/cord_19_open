Results C19SI was able to accommodate all of the government responses.Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate.The model predicted base-case scenario of 815 (95%CI, 753-877) active cases by 17 May 2020 and 648 (95%CI, 599-696) cases for the high-risk districts by 18 May 2020.", "title_summ": "COVID-19 case forecasting model for Sri Lanka based on Stringency IndexCOVID-19 UK Lockdown Forecasts and R0COVID-19 UK Lockdown Forecasts and R(0)", "title_abstract_phrases": "Key words: COVID-19, Projections, Stringency Index, SIR Model, Sri LankaCOVID-19 UK Lockdown Forecasts and R0Introduction The first reported UK case of COVID-19 occurred on 31 January 2020, and a lockdown of unknown duration began on 24 March.COVID-19 case forecasting model for Sri Lanka based on Stringency IndexIntroduction Sri Lanka has been able to contain COVID-19 transmission through very stringent suppression measures implemented from the onset.The objective of this paper is to describe a projection model for COVID-19 cases in Sri Lanka applied to different scenarios after lockout, utilizing the stringency index as a proxy of total government response.Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r.
