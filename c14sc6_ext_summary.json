considered in evaluating the impacts of pollutant source changes on air quality during the specific event and in assessing source-oriented risks.The first goal of this study is to quantify the magnitude and spatial variability of air quality changes in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic.To investigate the air quality changes during the COVID-19 lockdown over the YRD Region, we apply the WRF-CAMx modelling system together with monitoring data to investigate the impact of human activity pattern changes on air quality.With the aid of air quality data of seven pollutant parameters (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, O3 and NH3) for 34 monitoring stations spread over the megacity we have employed National Air Quality Index (NAQI) to show the spatial pattern of air quality in pre and during-lockdown phases.Abstract Number of cities worlwide experienced air quality improvements during COVID-19 lockdowns; however, such changes may have been different in places with major

experienced air quality improvements during COVID-19 lockdowns; however, such changes may have been different in places with major contributions from nontraffic related sources.Our study aims to describe changes in air pollution levels during the lockdown measures in the city of Barcelona (NE Spain), by studying the time evolution of atmospheric pollutants recorded at the urban background and traffic air quality monitoring stations.With reduced activities, severe air pollution events still occurred in the North China Plain, causing discussions regarding why severe air pollution was not avoided.On the basis of this quantitative analysis, we reached the following conclusions: (1) The reduction of air pollution was strongly associated with travel restrictions during this pandemic\u2014on average, the air quality index (AQI) decreased by 7.80%, and five air pollutants (i.e., SO2, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO) decreased by 6.76%, 5.93%, 13.66%, 24.67%, and 4.58%, respectively.For this study, changes in the air quality index (AQI) and the concentrations of six air pollutants (PM(2.5), PM(10), CO, SO(2), NO(2), and O(3)) were evaluated during the Covid-19 control period in northern China."}
