{"cluster": 13, "subcluster": 9, "abstract_summ": " Next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches have surpassed Sanger for generating long viral sequences, yet how variants affect NGS de novo assembly remains largely unexplored . Presence of variants can turn an assembly of one genome into tens to thousands of contigs . Findings were further supported by in silico simulations, where selective removal of minor variant reads from clinical datasets allow the \u2018rescue\u2019 of full viral genomes ."}
