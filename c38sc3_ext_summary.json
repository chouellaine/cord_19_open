kidney transplantation, personal protection of medical staff, and follow\u2010up management of discharged patients after kidney transplantation.CONCLUSIONS During surge outbreaks, kidney transplant patients with even mild symptoms have a high likelihood of COVID-19 disease and most will worsen requiring hospitalization for supportive measures.After a median of 10 days, 13 kidney transplant recipients were discharged, 2 were hospitalized in non- ICU, 1 was in ICU, and 2 patients had died.Three patients died (30%), and 5 (50%) developed acute kidney injury.", "title_summ": "- Does One
