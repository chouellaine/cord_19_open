{"cluster": 45, "subcluster": 1, "abstract_summ": "Conclusion Although elderly patients with comorbidities are considered highest risk for COVID-19 neurologic complications, usually when systemic symptoms are severe, this case report emphasizes that young individuals are at risk for VTE with neurologic complications even when systemic symptoms are mild, likely induced by COVID-19 associated hypercoagulable state.Rarely, pulmonary embolism may be encountered in patients with severe COVID-19 infection, especially in intensive care units.Neurologic complications and manifestations of COVID-19, including neuropathies, seizures, strokes and encephalopathy usually occur in severe established cases of COVID-19 infection who primarily present with respiratory distress.We report a 66-year-old female patient with post-mortem diagnosis of COVID-19 who presented progressive livedo racemosa, acute renal failure and myocardial injury, as well as an absence of respiratory symptoms.Three patients younger than 41 years of age with confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection had neurologic findings related to cerebral venous thrombosis.", "title_summ": "Cutaneous Complications Secondary to Haemostasis Abnormalities in COVID-19 InfectionCerebral Venous Thrombosis Associated with COVID-19.Hemorrhagic Stroke in Setting of Severe COVID-19 Infection Requiring Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)Acute Pulmonary Embolism in SARS-CoV-2 Infection Treated with Surgical EmbolectomySudden death due to acute pulmonary embolism in a young woman with COVID-19COVID-19 Presenting as Acute Limb IschaemiaCerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis as a Presentation of COVID-19\u201cCOVID-19 and cervical artery dissection- A causative association?\u201dCerebral Venous Thrombosis: Atypical Presentation of COVID-19 in the YoungConcomitant haemorrhagic syndrome and recurrent extensive arterial thrombosis in a patient with COVID\u201019 and acute promyelocytic leukaemiaHyperacute multi-organ thromboembolic storm in COVID-19: a case reportCoagulopathy in COVID-19 infection: a case of acute upper limb ischemia", "title_abstract_phrases": "Concomitant haemorrhagic syndrome and recurrent extensive arterial thrombosis in a patient with COVID\u201019 and acute promyelocytic leukaemiaAcute promyelocytic leukaemia and COVID-19 are two conditions associated with severe coagulopathy.Hemorrhagic Stroke in Setting of Severe COVID-19 Infection Requiring Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)OBJECTIVE: To highlight the increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke secondary to postulated COVID-19 mediated vasculopathy with concomitant ECMO related bleeding complications.Three patients younger than 41 years of age with confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection had neurologic findings related to cerebral venous thrombosis.We report a 66-year-old female patient with post-mortem diagnosis of COVID-19 who presented progressive livedo racemosa, acute renal failure and myocardial injury, as well as an absence of respiratory symptoms.Coagulopathy in COVID-19 infection: a case of acute upper limb ischemiaCoagulation abnormalities and thrombosis have been recently identified as sequelae of severe infection with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)."}
