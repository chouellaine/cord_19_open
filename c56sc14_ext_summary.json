As a general rule, we find that SARS-CoV-2 genome tends to diverge over time by accumulating mutations on its genome and, specifically, on the coding sequences for proteins N and S. Interestingly, different patterns of codon usage were observed among these genes.We identified key SARS-CoV-2 genes (S, N, ExoN, RNase, RdRp, Nsp7 and Nsp8) suggested to be causally implicated in the virus adaptation to the human host.We determined the SARS-CoV-2 selectome by calculating rates of pervasive and episodic diversifying selection for every amino acid coding position in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.To provide context for evolutionary dynamics of a highly pathogenic betacoronavirus following a zoonotic spillover into human hosts, we also determined the selectomes of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and performed evolvability calculations for SARS-CoV-2 based on SARS-CoV. These analyses identify the amino acid sites within each coding sequence that have been subjected to pervasive diversifying selection or episodic diversifying selection, and report significantly evolvable sites in the ORF1a polyprotein, the spike protein, and the membrane protein of SARS-CoV-2.We identified recombination coldspots in the S glycoprotein and strong purifying selection.", "title_summ": "Recombination and purifying selection preserves covariant movements of mosaic SARS-CoV-2 protein SSelectomic and Evolvability Analyses of the Highly Pathogenic Betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoVTemporal evolution and adaptation of SARS-COV 2 codon usageDinucleotide repeats in coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome: evolutionary implicationsRecombination and lineage-specific mutations led to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 through Recombination and Strong Purifying Selection", "title_abstract_phrases": "Recombination and purifying selection preserves covariant movements of mosaic SARS-CoV-2 protein SIn depth evolutionary and structural analyses of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolated from bats, pangolins, and humans are necessary to assess the role of natural selection and recombination in the emergence of the current pandemic strain.Thus, we compared the codon usage patterns, every two weeks, of 13 of SARS-CoV-2 genes encoding for the membrane protein (M), envelope (E), spike surface glycoprotein (S), nucleoprotein (N), non-structural 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro), ssRNA-binding protein (RBP), 2\u2019-O-ribose methyltransferase (OMT), endoRNase (RNase), helicase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Nsp7, Nsp8, and exonuclease ExoN.
