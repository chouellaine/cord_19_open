One patient who died also had increased levels of anti-envelope protein IgM. CSF analysis also showed markedly increased levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-10, but severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was not identified in any CSF sample.", "title_summ": "Encephalopathy and Encephalitis Associated with Cerebrospinal Fluid Cytokine Alterations and Coronavirus Disease, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, 2020.Neuroimaging findings in COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections: a systematic review in 116 patientsCOVID-19-associated encephalitis mimicking glial tumor: a case report.A case of possible atypical demyelinating event of the central nervous system following COVID-19Genetic Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy Associated with RANBP2: Clinical and Therapeutic Implications in PediatricsNeurologic Involvement in COVID-19: Cause or Coincidence?Encephalopathy in patients with COVID-19: A review.A Neuroimaging Perspective.", "title_abstract_phrases": "This case report highlights the neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 in selected patients and emphasizes the importance of repeated lumbar punctures and CSF analyses in patients with suspected Covid-19 and neurological symptoms.Our case is a post-COVID-19 demyelinating event in the CNS.Genetic Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy Associated with RANBP2: Clinical and Therapeutic Implications in PediatricsGenetic (also known as familial) acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE1) is a rare disease presenting with encephalopathy often following preceding viral febrile illness in patients with a genetic predisposition resulting from a missense mutation in the gene encoding RAN Binding Protein 2 (RANBP2).The most frequent symptoms that motivated neuroimaging examinations were mild nonfocal neurologic symptoms, code stroke (refers to patients presenting with signs and symptoms of stroke whose hyperacute assessment and care is prioritized), focal neurologic symptoms, postsedation encephalopathy, and seizures.Neuroimaging findings in COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections: a systematic review in 116 patientsAbstract Various neurologic syndromes have been described in patients with COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections.Familiarity with these radiologic patterns will guide radiologists and referring clinicians to consider coronavirus infections in patients with worsening or progressive neurologic findings, particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic."}
