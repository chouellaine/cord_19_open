patients may be more susceptible to severe infection and complications, highlighting various interventions that may help to ensure continuity of care in this unique cohort.Information technologies, treatment prioritization and implementation of hypofractionation and protection procedures allowed balancing between cancer patient care and patient/healthcare workers safety.This commentary discusses how to balance a delay in cancer diagnosis or treatment against the risk for a potential COVID-19 exposure, mitigate the risks for significant care disruptions associated with social distancing behaviors, and manage the appropriate allocation of limited health care resources in this unprecedented time of health care crisis.Recently, a large prospective cohort study of 800 cancer patients diagnosed with symptomatic COVID-19 demonstrated a mortality rate of 28%, which was largely driven by age, co-morbidities and being a male (Lee et al 2020).As the COVID-19 pandemic stretches on, investigators are becoming increasingly concerned about longer-term effects on grants and funding for cancer research.", "title_summ": "The Need for Deep and Lasting MeasuresA national survey on
