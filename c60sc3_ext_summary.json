To identify which PEDV proteins were the key inducers of autophagy, all 4 structural proteins and 17 nonstructural proteins of PEDV were eukaryotic expressed.We found that overexpression of Hsp70 could increase PEDV mRNA synthesis and protein expression in Vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells, while the siRNAs mediated knockdown of Hsp70 and VER155008 mediated inhibition of Hsp70 resulted in inhibition of viral mRNA synthesis and protein expression in Vero E6 cells.These results indicated that ribosome proteins and oxidative phosphorylation process were widely involved in the pathological changes and regulation of host cells caused by PEDV infection, and PI3K/AKT and mTOR signaling pathways played a vital role in antiviral regulation in IPEC-J2 cells.The results shown that PEDV replication increased the autophagy flux in IPEC-J2 cells, and that autophagy was beneficial to PEDV replication, which may be one of the reasons for the rapid damage to intestinal epithelial cells and the enhanced virulence of PEDV in both newborn piglets and finishing pigs.These data suggested that Hsp70 positively regulated PEDV mRNA synthesis and protein expression, which being helpful for understanding the seasonality of PED epidemics and development of novel antiviral therapies in the future.", "title_summ": "Cold Exposure-Induced Up-Regulation of Hsp70 Positively Regulates PEDV mRNA Synthesis and Protein Expression In VitroPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection blocks Cell cycle and induces apoptosis in pig intestinal epithelial cellsNonstructural protein 6 of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus induces autophagy to promote viral replication via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axisPorcine Epidemic Diarrhoea Virus Induces Cell-cycle Arrest through the DNA Damage-signalling PathwayMiR-10a-5p-Mediated Syndecan 1 Suppression Restricts Porcine Hemagglutinating Encephalomyelitis Virus Replication", "title_abstract_phrases": "When autophagy was pharmacologically suppressed by hydroxychloroquine, PEDV replication decreased from 8.5 \u00d7 105 TCID50/mL to 7.9 \u00d7 104 TCID50/mL.
