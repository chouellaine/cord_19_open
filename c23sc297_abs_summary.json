{"cluster": 23, "subcluster": 297, "abstract_summ": " We predict the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries by using a regression-based predictive model . In particular, the growth rate of the infection has been fitted as an exponential decay, as compared to a linear decay . The model predicts the approximate number of total infections at the end of the outbreak ."}
