Studies published in any language reporting incidence of or outcomes associated with coronavirus infections in HCWs and studies on the association between risk factors (demographic characteristics, role, exposures, environmental and administrative factors, and personal protective equipment [PPE] use) and HCW infections.Since the supply and use of PPE improved, the infection risk of HW in Malaysia seems to have decreased.Moreover, the formulated model can be used for other similar scenarios, such as identifying infection risk in public transportation, school classroom settings, offices, and mass gatherings.Particular attention should focus on HCWs with risk factors to prevent adverse outcomes and reduce infection risk.", "title_summ": "The Role of Improved Case Detection and

Wuhan, ChinaIMPORTANCE: Health care workers (HCWs) have high infection risk owing to treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).STUDY SELECTION: Studies published in any language reporting incidence of or outcomes associated with coronavirus infections in HCWs and studies on the association between risk factors (demographic characteristics, role, exposures, environmental and administrative factors, and personal protective equipment [PPE] use) and HCW infections.Compared with non-healthcare workers cases, healthcare workers cases were younger (P < 0.001), more likely to be female (P < 0.001), non-nationals (P < 0.001) and asymptomatic (P < 0.001), and have fewer comorbidities (P < 0.001) and higher rates of survival (P < 0.001).In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers.Keywords COVID-19, healthcare workers, testing, outbreak investigation, transmission dynamicsA COVID-19 Infection Risk Model for Frontline
