A total of 45 SARS-CoV-2 associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases were enrolled.Our results demonstrate that our multiplex assay performs as well as the modified CDC assay, but is more efficient and cost effective and is therefore adequate for use as a diagnostic assay and for epidemiological surveillance and clinical management of SARS-CoV-2.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a rapidly spreading global pathogen stressing the need for development of rapid testing protocols ever than before.", "title_summ": "Design of a Novel Multiplex Real Time RT-PCR Assay for SARS-CoV-2 DetectionDevelopment of a dual-gene loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) detection assay for SARS-CoV-2: A preliminary studyA comparative study of isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection at point of careCoV2ID: Detection and Therapeutics Oligo Database for SARS-CoV-2A facile Q-RT-PCR assay for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 growth in cell cultureMolecular Diagnosis of COVID-19: Challenges and Research NeedsComparison of a Laboratory-Developed Test Targeting the Envelope gene with three Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests for Detection of SARS-CoV-2", "title_abstract_phrases": "Comparison of a Laboratory-Developed Test Targeting the Envelope gene with three Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests for Detection of SARS-CoV-2BACKGROUND: Numerous nucleic acid amplification tests, including real-time, reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) and isothermal amplification methods, have been developed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA, including many that have received emergency use authorization (EUA).Here we developed a facile Q-RT-PCR assay that bypasses viral RNA extraction steps and can monitor SARS-CoV-2 replication kinetics from a small amount of cell culture supernatants.Our results demonstrate that our multiplex assay performs as well as the modified CDC assay, but is more efficient and cost effective and is therefore adequate for use as a diagnostic assay and for epidemiological surveillance and clinical management of SARS-CoV-2.Development of a dual-gene loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) detection assay for SARS-CoV-2: A preliminary studySevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a rapidly spreading global pathogen stressing the need for development of rapid testing protocols ever than before.In order to improve the detection capability, the RT-LAMP assay was developed to simultaneously amplify two viral genes: ORF1a and N.
