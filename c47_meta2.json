To analyze the clinical characteristics of these patients, data was extracted from their medical records. K. pneumoniae strains were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, capsular genotyping and detection of the rmpA and rmpA2 genes to identify hypervirulent strains. RESULTS: We identified 276 patients with pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae, of which 68 (24.6%), 74 (26.8%), and 134 (48.6%) presented with CAP, HCAP, and HAP, respectively. The 28-day mortality was highest in the HAP group (39.6%), followed by the HCAP (29.7%) and CAP (27.9%) groups. The HAP group also featured the highest proportion of multi-drug resistant strains (49.3%), followed by the HCAP (36.5%) and CAP groups (10.3%), while the CAP group had the highest proportion of hypervirulent strains (79.4%), followed by the HCAP (55.4%) and HAP groups (41.0%). CONCLUSION: Pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae was associated with a high mortality. Importantly, multi-drug resistant strains were also detected in patients with CAP. Hypervirulent strains were prevalent in all 3 groups of pneumonia patients, even in those with HAP.","publish_time":1578009600000,"author_summary":" Juan, Chih-Han; Fang, Shih-Yu; Chou,<br>Chia-Hsin; Tsai, Tsung-Ying; Lin, Yi-Tsung","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: We aimed to compare the clinical<br>characteristics of patients with community-acquired<br>pneumonia (CAP), healthcare-associated pneumonia<br>(HCAP), and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) caused<br>by Klebsiella pneumoniae and analyze the<br>antimicrobial resistance and proportion of hypervirluent<br>strains of the microbial isolates.

Enterobacteriaceae HAI cases were Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter isolates from blood, urine, wound or respiratory specimen collected on or after day 3 of ICU admission. CRE HAI cases were those resistant to at least one carbapenem. For CRE HAI cases reported during 2011\u20132017, a hospital-level and patient-level analysis were conducted using only the first CRE isolate by pathogen and specimen type for each patient. For facility, microbiology, and clinical characteristics, frequencies and means were calculated among CRE HAI cases and compared with carbapenem-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae HAI cases through univariate and multivariate logistic regression using STATA 13. RESULTS: There were 1598 Enterobacteriaceae HAI cases, of which 871 (54.1%) were carbapenem resistant. The multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that carbapenem resistance was associated with specimen type, pathogen, location prior to admission, and length of ICU stay.

The capability of A. baumannii to persist and disseminate between healthcare settings has raised a major concern worldwide. METHODS: Our study investigated the antibiotic resistance features and molecular epidemiology of 52 clinical isolates of A. baumannii collected in Pakistan between 2013 and 2015. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined by the agar disc diffusion method. Comparative sequence analyses of the ampC and bla(OXA-51-like) alleles were used to assign the isolates into clusters. The whole genomes of 25 representative isolates were sequenced using the MiSeq Desktop Sequencer. Free online applications were used to determine the phylogeny of genomic sequences, retrieve the multilocus sequence types (ST), and detect acquired antimicrobial resistance genes. RESULTS: Overall, the isolates were grouped into 7 clusters and 3 sporadic isolates. The largest cluster, Ab-Pak-cluster-1 (bla(OXA-66) and ISAba1-ampC-19) included 24 isolates, belonged to ST2 and International clone (IC) II, and was distributed between two geographical far-off cities, Lahore and Peshawar. Ab-Pak-clusters-2 (bla(OXA-66), ISAba1-ampC-2), and -3 (bla(OXA-66), ISAba1-ampC-20) and the individual isolate Ab-Pak-Lah-01 (ISAba1-bla(OXA-66), ISAba1-ampC-2) were also assigned to ST2 and IC II. On the other hand, Ab-Pak-clusters-4 (bla(OXA-69), ampC-1), -5 (bla(OXA-69), ISAba1-ampC-78), and -6A (bla(OXA-371), ISAba1-ampC-3) belonged to ST1, while Ab-Pak-cluster-6B (bla(OXA-371), ISAba1-ampC-8) belonged to ST1106, with both ST1 and ST1106 being members of IC I. Five isolates belonged to Ab-Pak-cluster-7 (bla(OXA-65), ampC-43). This cluster corresponded to ST158, showed a well-delineated position on the genomic phylogenetic tree, and was equipped with several antimicrobial resistance genes including bla(OXA-23) and bla(GES-11). CONCLUSIONS: Our study detected the occurrence of 7 clusters of A. baumannii in Pakistan. Altogether, 6\/7 of the clusters and 45\/52 (86.5%) of the isolates belonged to IC I (n = 9) or II (n = 36), making Pakistan no exception to the global domination of these two clones. The onset of ST158 in Pakistan marked a geographical dispersal of this clone beyond the Middle East and brought up the need for a detailed characterization.","publish_time":1579046400000,"author_summary":" Karah, Nabil; Khalid, Fizza; Wai, Sun Nyunt;<br>Uhlin, Bernt Eric; Ahmad, Irfan","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumannii is a<br>Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen with a notorious<br>reputation of being resistant to antimicrobial agents.<br>The capability of A. baumannii to persist and<br>disseminate between healthcare settings has raised a major<br>concern worldwide.

Strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or carbapenemases are considered global priority pathogens for which new treatment and prevention strategies are urgently required, due to severely limited therapeutic options. South and Southeast Asia are major hubs for antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) K. pneumoniae and also for the characteristically antimicrobial-sensitive, community-acquired \u201chypervirulent\u201d strains. The emergence of hypervirulent AMR strains and lack of data on exopolysaccharide diversity pose a challenge for K. pneumoniae BSI control strategies worldwide. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective genomic epidemiology study of 365 BSI K. pneumoniae from seven major healthcare facilities across South and Southeast Asia, extracting clinically relevant information (AMR, virulence, K and O antigen loci) using Kleborate, a K. pneumoniae-specific genomic typing tool. RESULTS: K. pneumoniae BSI isolates were highly diverse, comprising 120 multi-locus sequence types (STs) and 63 K-loci. ESBL and carbapenemase gene frequencies were 47% and 17%, respectively. The aerobactin synthesis locus (iuc), associated with hypervirulence, was detected in 28% of isolates. Importantly, 7% of isolates harboured iuc plus ESBL and\/or carbapenemase genes. The latter represent genotypic AMR-virulence convergence, which is generally considered a rare phenomenon but was particularly common among South Asian BSI (17%). Of greatest concern, we identified seven novel plasmids carrying both iuc and AMR genes, raising the prospect of co-transfer of these phenotypes among K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: K. pneumoniae BSI in South and Southeast Asia are caused by different STs from those predominating in other regions, and with higher frequency of acquired virulence determinants. K. pneumoniae carrying both iuc and AMR genes were also detected at higher rates than have been reported elsewhere. The study demonstrates how genomics-based surveillance\u2014reporting full molecular profiles including STs, AMR, virulence and serotype locus information\u2014can help standardise comparisons between sites and identify regional differences in pathogen populations.

OBJECTIVE: Describe the data generated by the influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 surveillance in Saudi Arabia from 2010 to 2016. DESIGN: Retrospective, descriptive. SETTING: Hospitals reporting to the Ministry of Health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied aggregate data on hospitalized cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Saudi Arabia between 2010 and 2016. The surveillance system used the case definition proposed by the WHO. The cases were confirmed by performing the real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on upper respiratory samples. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Suspected and confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases. SAMPLE SIZE: 113 502 suspected H1N1 cases and 17 094 (15.1%) confirmed cases. RESULTS: Most of the reported cases were registered in the Riyadh region. During the period of the study, the highest number of confirmed cases, 9262 (54.2 %), was in 2015. The case fatality rate for confirmed cases was 3.6%. CONCLUSION: Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 showed seasonal trends. The number of suspected influenza cases each year was proportionate to the number of confirmed cases for that year.

BALF and OPS identified respiratory pathogen infections in 57 (75%) and 49 (64.5%) patients, respectively (P > 0.05). The etiology analysis revealed that viruses were responsible for 53.7% of the patients, whereas bacteria accounted for 32.9% and Mycoplasma pneumoniae for 13.4%. The leading 5 pathogens identified were respiratory syncytial virus, Streptococcus pneumoniaee, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and adenovirus, and they accounted for 74.2% of etiological fraction.

The objective of our study was to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility, the associated molecular mechanisms of resistance and the epidemiological relatedness of MRSA strains isolated from the endotracheal tubes (ETT) of intubated critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with nosocomial pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: The antimicrobial susceptibility to vancomycin, linezolid, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, fusidic acid, gentamicin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, rifampicin, sulfamethoxazole\/trimethoprim, and tetracycline were measured. Resistance mechanisms were then analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Molecular epidemiology was carried out by multi-locus sequence typing. RESULTS: S. aureus isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, clindamycin, and fusidic acid. The most frequent mutations in quinolone-resistant S. aureus strains were S84L in the gyrA gene, V511A in the gyrB gene, S144P in the grlA gene, and K401R\/E in the grlB gene. Strains resistant to erythromycin carried the ermC, ermA, and msrA genes; the same ermC and ermA genes were detected in strains resistant to clindamycin. The aac(6\u2032)-aph(2\u2033) gene was related to gentamicin resistance, while resistance to tetracycline was related to tetK (efflux pump). The fusB gene was detected in the strain resistant to fusidic acid. The most frequent sequence types were ST22, ST8, and ST217, which were distributed in four clonal complexes (CC5, CC22, CC45, and CC59). CONCLUSIONS: High levels of resistance to second-line antimicrobials threatens the treatment of nosocomial respiratory infections due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus with decreased susceptibility to linezolid and vancomycin.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in adult patients with a laboratory confirmed influenza virus infection in three Dutch hospitals during respiratory seasons 2014\u20132015 and 2015\u20132016. Incidence was calculated as the weekly number of hospitalised influenza patients divided by the total population in the catchment populations of the three hospitals.

These hospitalisation costs were extrapolated to national level and expressed in 2017 euros. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 380 hospitalised adult influenza patients. The seasonal cumulative incidence was 3.5 cases per 10,000 persons in respiratory season 2014\u20132015, compared to 1.8 cases per 10,000 persons in 2015\u20132016.

Our aim was to evaluate whether a semi-quantitative assessment of rectal\/throat ESBL-E carriage can predict ESBL-E-associated VAP in medical ICU patients. METHODS: From May 2014 to May 2017, all ESBL-E carriers had a semi-quantitative assessment of ESBL-E density in swabs cultures. For those who developed GNB-VAP (diagnosed using bronchoalveolar lavage or plugged telescopic catheter with significant quantitative culture), the last positive swab collected at least 48 h before GNB-VAP onset was selected. Clinical data were extracted from a prospectively collected database. RESULTS: Among 365 ESBL-E carriers, 82 developed 107 episodes of GNB-VAP (ESBL-E VAP, n = 50; and non-ESBL-E GNB-VAP, n = 57) after 13 days of mechanical ventilation in median. Antimicrobials use before VAP onset was similar between groups. The last swabs were collected 5 days in median before VAP onset. ESBL-E. coli carriers developed ESBL-E VAP less frequently (n = 13, 34%) than others (n = 32, 67.3%, p < .01). Throat swab positivity (39 (78%) vs. 12 (23%), p < .01) was more frequent for ESBL-E VAP. ESBL-E VAP was associated with significantly higher ESBL-E density in rectal swabs. In multivariate models, non-E. coli ESBL-E carriage and rectal ESBL-E carriage density, or throat carriage, remained associated with ESBL-E VAP. CONCLUSION: In carriers of ESBL-E other than E. coli, ESBL-E throat carriage or a high-density ESBL-E rectal carriage are risk factors of ESBL-E VAP in case of GNB-VAP.

METHODS: Clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with C. krusei candidemia were evaluated. Yeast identification and antifungal susceptibility testing was performed according to standard protocol. To find the potential source of C. krusei in hospital environment and hand colonization, swabs were collected from different fomites (n = 40) and hand washings from 24 health care workers (HCW), respectively.

Co-infection can be either viral-viral or viral-bacterial and with new technology there is more information on the role they play on the health of children. RECENT FINDINGS: With the proliferation of multiplex PCR for rapid diagnosis of multiple viruses as well as innovations on identification of bacterial infections, research has been attempting to discover how these co-infections affect each other and the host. Studies are aiming to discern if the epidemiology of viruses seen at a population level is related to the interaction between different viruses on a host level. Studies are also attempting to discover the burden of morbidity and mortality of these viral-viral co-infections on the pediatric population. It is also becoming important to understand the interplay of certain viruses with specific bacteria and understanding the impact of viral-bacterial co-infections. SUMMARY: RSV continues to contribute to a large burden of disease for pediatric patients with acute respiratory illnesses. However, recent literature suggests that viral-viral co-infections do not add to this burden and might, in some cases, be protective of severe disease. Viral-bacterial co-infections, on the other hand, are most likely adding to the burden of morbidity in pediatric patients because of the synergistic way they can infect the nasopharyngeal space. Future research needs to focus on confirming these conclusions as it could affect hospital cohorting, role of molecular testing, and therapeutic interventions.","publish_time":1579824000000,"author_summary":" Meskill, Sarah D.; O\u2019Bryant, Shelease C.","abstract_summary":" PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This investigation aims to<br>understand the role and burden of viral co-infections for<br>acute respiratory illnesses in children.<br>Co-infection can be either viral-viral or viral-bacterial<br>and with new technology there is more information<br>on the role they play on the health of children.<br>RECENT FINDINGS: With the proliferation of multiplex<br>PCR for rapid diagnosis of multiple viruses as well<br>as innovations on identification of bacterial<br>infections, research has been attempting to discover how<br>these co-infections affect each other and the host.<br>Studies are aiming to discern if the epidemiology of<br>viruses seen at a population level is...","title_summary":" Respiratory Virus Co-infection in Acute<br>Respiratory Infections in Children","x":15.5005149841,"y":-6.2754673958,"cluster":47,"cluster_name":"c48","cluster_description":"Respiratory Virus Infections","tsne_x":15.5005149841,"tsne_y":-6.2754673958,"subcluster":15,"subcluster_description":"Respiratory Viral Infection","shape":"p"},{"cord_uid":"j6l0vonr","source_x":"PMC","title":"Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacterales: Considerations for Treatment in the Era of New Antimicrobials and Evolving Enzymology","doi":"10.1007\/s11908-020-0716-3","abstract":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Gram-negative resistance is a growing concern globally.

In addition, the numbers of ABI were positively associated with mean ambient outdoor temperatures (P = 0.002), with the incidence of ABP and average numbers of ABI among NICU patients being substantially lower in the winter as compared to other seasons. However, there were no significant seasonal variations in the other strains of the top five bacteria.

We assessed the performance and the potential impact of the M-PCR on the antibiotic therapy of ICU patients. METHODS: In this prospective study, we performed a M-PCR on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or plugged telescoping catheter (PTC) samples of patients with ventilated HAP or VAP with Gram-negative bacilli or clustered Gram-positive cocci. This study was conducted in 3 ICUs in a French academic hospital: the medical and infectious diseases ICU, the surgical ICU, and the cardio-surgical ICU. A multidisciplinary expert panel simulated the antibiotic changes they would have made if the M-PCR results had been available. RESULTS: We analyzed 95 clinical samples of ventilated HAP or VAP (72 BAL and 23 PTC) from 85 patients (62 males, median age 64 years). The median turnaround time of the M-PCR was 4.6 h (IQR 4.4\u20135). A total of 90\/112 bacteria were detected by the M-PCR system with a global sensitivity of 80% (95% CI, 73\u201388%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI 99\u2013100). The sensitivity was better for Gram-negative bacteria (90%) than for Gram-positive cocci (62%) (p = 0.005). Moreover, 5\/8 extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (CTX-M gene) and 4\/4 carbapenemases genes (3 NDM, one oxa-48) were detected. The M-PCR could have led to the earlier initiation of an effective antibiotic in 20\/95 patients (21%) and to early de-escalation in 37 patients (39%) but could also have led to one (1%) inadequate antimicrobial therapy. Among 17 empiric antibiotic treatments with carbapenems, 10 could have been de-escalated in the following hours according to the M-PCR results.

We performed this study to evaluate the concordance between the multiplex PCR\u2013based Unyvero pneumonia cartridge assay and conventional microbiological techniques to identify pathogens and their resistance mechanisms in patients with VAP. METHODS: All patients suspected of having VAP (January 2016 to January 2019), who underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and whose BALF microscopy examination revealed intracellular bacteria, were included. BALF conventional cultures (gold standard), antimicrobial susceptibility testing and processing for the Unyvero pneumonia cartridge were done. Culture and Unyvero results were compared. RESULTS: Compared to cultures of the 93 samples processed for both techniques, Unyvero correctly identified pathogens in 68 (73%) proven VAP episodes, was discordant for 25 (27%), detected no pathogen in 11 and overdetected a not otherwise found pathogen in six.

METHODS: Here, the molecular and virulent characteristics of 44 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates collected from January 2015 to December 2017 were studied. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were carried out to define the clonal relatedness among the isolates. PCR and capsular serotyping of the virulence-associated genes, as well as biofilm formation and serum complement-mediated killing assays, were employed to determine the virulent potential. The genomic features and associated mobile genetic elements of JmsCRE57 were detected by whole genome sequencing. RESULTS: The only positive isolate was JmsCRE57, which belonged to the ST375 serotype K2 that expressed uge, mrkD, fimH, kpn, aerobactin and rmpA virulence-associated genes and showed strong biofilm formation and serum sensitivity. Sequencing results showed that the JmsCRE57 genome mainly consisted of a circular chromosome, three antimicrobial resistant plasmids and a virulent plasmid. The antimicrobial resistant plasmid expressing bla(KPC-2), bla(CTX-M-15), aph(3\u2033)-Ib, aph(6)-Id, qnrB1, aac(3)-IIa, aac(6\u2032)-Ib-cr, bla(OXA-1), bla(TEM-1B), catB4, sul2, dfrA14 and bla(SHV-99). The virulent plasmid belonged to the IncHI1B group, which is mainly composed of mucoid phenotype genes and siderophore-associated genes. The remaining CRKP strains that expressed uge, fimH, mrkD and kpn virulence-associated genes were not successfully typed.

RESULTS: In all 10 patients, early and rapid diagnosis for severe M. pneumoniae pneumonia with ARDS was achieved with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) testing of samples from the lower respiratory tract or pleural effusion. The average PaO(2)\/FiO(2) of all patients was 180 mmHg. Of the 10 cases, 4 cases had moderate ARDS (100 mmHg \u2264 PaO(2)\/FiO(2) < 200 mmHg) and 3 cases had severe ARDS (PaO(2)\/FiO(2) < 100 mmHg).

High resistance (median 15 L\/cmH(2)O\/s) and low compliance (median 38 ml\/cmH(2)O) was observed in 4 cases.

This pattern of resistance is due mainly to dissemination of carbapenemase genes. Molecular characterization of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-KP) strains was performed over a three-year period. In-depth analysis was performed on a subset of emerging CR-KP ST101 and ST307 clones. METHODS: A prospective study was performed on 691 patients with CR-KP bloodstream infections hospitalized in 19 hospitals located in three large provinces in Southern Italy. Carbapenemase genes were identified via genotyping methods. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) were carried out on ST101 and ST307 isolates. RESULTS: Among the CR-KP isolates, bla(KPC) was found in 95.6%, bla(VIM) was found in 3.5%, bla(NDM) was found in 0.1% and bla(OXA-48) was found in 0.1%. The bla(KPC-3) variant was identified in all 104 characterized KPC-KP isolates. MLST of 231 representative isolates revealed ST512 in 45.5%, ST101 in 20.3% and ST307 in 18.2% of the isolates. cgMLST of ST307 and ST101 isolates revealed presence of more than one beta-lactam resistance gene. Amino acid substitution in the chromosomal colistin-resistance gene pmrB was found in two ST101 isolates. CONCLUSIONS: ST512 is widespread in Southern Italy, but ST101 and ST307 are emerging since they were found in a significant proportion of cases. Aggressive infection control measures and a continuous monitoring of these high-risk clones are necessary to avoid rapid spread of CR-KP, especially in hospital settings.","publish_time":1590969600000,"author_summary":" Loconsole, Daniela; Accogli, Marisa; De<br>Robertis, Anna Lisa; Capozzi, Loredana; Bianco,<br>Angelica; Morea, Anna; Mallamaci, Rosanna; Quarto,<br>Michele; Parisi, Antonio; Chironna, Maria","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant<br>Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-KP) is an urgent public health<br>issue in Italy.

This study evaluated whether participants with submicroscopic P. falciparum infections have higher prevalence of fever than uninfected participants in southern Malawi. METHODS: A total of 16,650 children and adults were enrolled in the course of six cross-sectional surveys during the dry season (October\u2013November) and after the rainy season (April\u2013May) between 2012 and 2014 in three districts in southern Malawi. Demographic and socioeconomic data were collected in conjunction with data on clinical histories, use of malaria preventive measures, and anti-malarial medication taken within 2 weeks of the survey. Axillary temperatures were measured, and blood samples were collected for P. falciparum detection by microscopy and PCR. Participants without malaria parasites detected on microscopy but with a positive PCR for P. falciparum were defined as having submicroscopic infection. Fever was defined as having any one of: reported fever in the past 2 weeks, reported fever in the past 48 h, or a temperature of \u2265 37.5 \u00b0C measured at the time of interview. RESULTS: Submicroscopic P. falciparum infections and fever were both detected in 9% of the study population. In the final analysis adjusted for clustering within household and enumeration area, having submicroscopic P. falciparum infection was associated with reduced odds of fever in the dry season (odds ratio = 0.52; 95% CI 0.33\u20130.82); the association in the rainy season did not achieve statistical significance (odds ratio = 1.20; 95% CI 0.91\u20131.59).

RECENT FINDINGS: The discontinuation of CP had no effect on the incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. The evidence regarding CP for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae is inconclusive, highlighting the need for more research to determine best infection control strategies. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae maintains a sporadic pattern in the USA, supporting current recommendations to use CP for colonized and infected patients. MDR Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB) is extremely virulent and responsible for outbreaks in healthcare settings, emphasizing the need for CP use with MDR-AB infected patients. Candida auris (C. auris) is often misdiagnosed; it is resistant to UV light and quaternary ammonium low-level disinfection. Because little is known about the transmission of C. auris, significant caution and CP use are necessitated. There is little research on vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) control strategies due to its rarity; thus, CP is strongly recommended.

Here, we describe influenza virus strain circulation in the GIHSN participant countries during 2017\u20132018 season and examine factors associated with complicated hospitalization among patients admitted with laboratory-confirmed influenza illness. METHODS: The study enrolled patients who were hospitalized in a GIHSN hospital in the previous 48 h with acute respiratory symptoms and who had symptoms consistent with influenza within the 7 days before admission. Enrolled patients were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to confirm influenza virus infection. \u201cComplicated hospitalization\u201d was defined as a need for mechanical ventilation, admission to an intensive care unit, or in-hospital death. In each of four age strata (< 15, 15\u2013< 50, 50\u2013< 65, and \u2265 65 years), factors associated with complicated hospitalization in influenza-positive patients were identified by mixed effects logistic regression and those associated with length of hospital stay using a linear mixed-effects regression model. RESULTS: The study included 12,803 hospitalized patients at 14 coordinating sites in 13 countries, of which 4306 (34%) tested positive for influenza. Influenza viruses B\/Yamagata, A\/H3N2, and A\/H1N1pdm09 strains dominated and cocirculated, although the dominant strains varied between sites. Complicated hospitalization occurred in 10.6% of influenza-positive patients. Factors associated with complicated hospitalization in influenza-positive patients included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (15\u2013< 50 years and \u2265 65 years), diabetes (15\u2013< 50 years), male sex (50\u2013< 65 years), hospitalization during the last 12 months (50\u2013< 65 years), and current smoking (\u226565 years). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (50\u2013< 65 years), other chronic conditions (15\u2013< 50 years), influenza A (50\u2013< 65 years), and hospitalization during the last 12 months (< 15 years) were associated with a longer hospital stay.

Patient characteristics were compared between influenza A H1N1 and other types of influenza using multivariable logistic regression analysis and subgroup analysis for factors associated with mortality in H1N1 Pneumonia was performed. RESULTS: Out of 497 adult patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP), 172 fulfilled the criteria for Influenza like illness (ILI). 88 patients had PCR confirmed Influenza pneumonia of whom n = 57 (65%) had Influenza A H1N1. The mean age of patients 53.5 years (SD: 17.3) and 60% were male. The overall mortality from Influenza in this study was 15.9% (n = 14); out of these 11 (78.5%) had Influenza A H1N1. Multivariable analysis showed that the increase in length of hospital admission was significantly associated with H1N1 Influenza A infection (OR: 1.47 CI: 1.2\u20131.8).

METHODS: Non-redundant clinical samples obtained from hospitalized patients throughout Serbia were included in the prospective, observational, multicenter study conducted from January to June 2018. Samples were initially screened for the presence of Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus (Acb) complex using conventional bacteriological techniques. Acb complexes recovered from clinical samples obtained from inpatients with confirmed bacterial infections were further evaluated for the presence of A. baumannii. Identification to the species level was done by the detection of the bla(OXA-51) gene and rpoB gene sequence analysis. Susceptibility testing was done by disk diffusion and broth microdilution method. CRAB isolates were tested for the presence of acquired carbapenemases (bla(OXA-24-like), bla(OXA-23-like,)bla(OXA-58-like), bla(OXA-143-like), bla(IMP), bla(VIM), bla(GIM), bla(SPM), bla(SIM), bla(NDM)) by PCR. Clonal relatedness was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). RESULTS: Acb complex was isolated in 280 out of 2401 clinical samples (11.6%). Overall, A. baumannii was identified in 237 out of 280 Acb complex (84.6%). CRAB prevalence was found to be 93.7% (237\/222).

This study tries to analyze the difference in profiles of antibiotic prescription in the treatment of children and adults with URTI in Bangka Tengah, Indonesia. Methods Random prescriptions from patients diagnosed with URTIs (sinusitis, bronchitis, common cold, and pharyngitis) from all PHCCs in Bangka Tengah were collected from January to February 2018. Prescriptions from patients with overlapping diagnoses, such as URTI with diarrhea or typhoid, were excluded. Results During the two months of data collection, 1348 prescriptions for adults and children with URTIs were studied. Children were 1.30 (95% CI, 1.03-1.58) times more likely to be treated with antibiotics compared to adults. Amoxicillin was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic both in children (92.3%) and adults (78.6%). Ciprofloxacin was commonly prescribed in adults (14.6%) but not in children (0.3%). Conclusions This study confirms the major antibiotic overuse in patients with URTI, especially in children. Owing to the fact that children are more likely to get URTI of viral origin, they receive high percentage of antibiotic therapy.

This work is conducted to better understand the epidemiological characteristics of respiratory viruses circulating in southern China. METHODS Totally 22,680 respiratory samples were collected from ARI patients from 18 hospitals in southern China during 2009-2018, and seven common respiratory viruses including Flu, RSV, PIV, hMPV, ADV, HCoV and HBoV were screened using in-house real-time PCR. RESULTS Totally 9,760 ARI cases (9760\/22680, 43.03%) were detected as positive for the 7 common respiratory viruses. The most detected virus was Flu (14.15%), followed by RSV (10.33%) and PIV (5.43%). Flu-A, PIV3 and HCoV-OC43 were the predominant subtypes. Although most of the viruses were more easily detected in inpatients and males, Flu was more likely detected in outpatient and females. Flu infection was more likely to cause URTI (upper respiratory tract infection), whereas RSV infection was more likely to cause pneumonia and bronchitis. The prevalence of Flu was particularly high in 2009. The epidemic level was found notably high in 2014-2018 for RSV, in 2016-2018 for PIV, in the summer of 2018 for ADV, in the summer of 2016 and winter of 2018 for HCoV, and in the summer of 2011 and autumn of 2018 for HBoV.

Here we assess the dynamics of respiratory viral co-infections in children and adults and determine predisposition for or against specific viral pairings. METHODS Over 5 respiratory seasons from November 30, 2013 through June 6, 2018, mono- and co-infection prevalence of 13 viral pathogens were tabulated at The Cleveland Clinic. Employing a model to proportionally distribute viral pairs utilizing individual virus' co-infection rate with prevalence patterns of concurrent co-circulating viruses, we compared predicted-to-observed occurrences of 132 viral pairing permutations using binomial analysis. RESULTS Of 30,535 respiratory samples, 9,843 (32.2%) were positive for \u22651 virus of which 1,018 (10.8%) were co-infected. Co-infected samples predominantly originated from children. Co-infection rate in pediatric population was 35.0% (2068\/5906), compared to only 5.8% (270\/4591) in adults. Adenovirus C (ADVC) had the highest co-infection rate (426\/623, 68.3%) while influenza B had the lowest (55\/546, 10.0%). ADVC-rhinovirus (HRV), RSVA-HRV, and RSVB-HRV pairings occurred at significantly higher frequencies than predicted by the proportional distribution model (p<0.05).

There was a statistically significant association between increased days of orotracheal intubation (OTI) and positive BA (18.9 days versus 10.9 days, p<0.01), polymicrobial infection (22.11 versus 13.54, p<0.01) and isolation of resistant microorganisms (18.88 versus 10.94, p<0.01). In 88% of the cases a change in antibiotic treatment was made. Conclusion: Nosocomial respiratory infection in intubated COVID-19 patients seems to be higher than in non-epidemic periods. The longer the intubation period, the greater the probability of co-infection, isolation of resistant microorganisms and polymicrobial infection.

Methods. COVID-19 ICU patients with clinically-suspected secondary infection at 5 UK hospitals were tested with the FilmArray at point of care. We collected patient demographic data and compared FilmArray results with routine culture. Results. We report results of 110 FilmArray tests on 94 patients (16 had 2 tests): 69 patients (73%) were male, the median age was 59 yrs; 92 were ventilated. Median hospital stay before testing was 14 days (range 1-38). Fifty-nine (54%) tests were positive, with 141 bacteria detected. Most were Enterobacterales (n=55, including Klebsiella spp. [n= 35]) or Staphylococcus aureus (n=13), as is typical of hospital and ventilator pneumonia. Community pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae (n=8) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=1), were rarer. FilmArray detected one additional virus (Rhinovirus\/Enterovirus) and no atypical bacteria. Fewer samples (28 % vs. 54%) were positive by routine culture, and fewer species were reported per sample; Klebsiella species remained the most prevalent pathogens. Conclusion. FilmArray had a higher diagnostic yield than culture for ICU COVID-19 patients with suspected secondary pneumonias. The bacteria found mostly were Enterobacterales, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, as in typical HAP\/VAP, but with Klebsiella spp. more prominent. We found almost no viral co-infection.

A total of 381 individuals, including 91 inpatients and 290 health care workers (HCWs), were included in the investigation. Results: During a 12-day period in early 2019, infection preventionists identified 89 HCWs and 18 inpatients as cases of influenza-like illness (ILI), using an amended definition, without the requirement for fever. Sequencing of IAV genomes from available nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens identified 66 individuals infected with a nearly identical strain of influenza A H1N1 (43 HCWs, 17 inpatients, and 6 with unspecified affiliation). All HCWs infected with the outbreak strain had received the seasonal influenza virus vaccination. Characterization of five representative outbreak viral isolates did not show antigenic drift. In conjunction with IAV genome sequencing, mining of electronic records pinpointed the origin of the outbreak as a single patient and a few interactions in the emergency department that occurred one day prior to the index ILI cluster. Conclusions: We used precision surveillance to identify and control a large nosocomial IAV outbreak, mapping the source of the outbreak to a single patient rather than HCWs as initially assumed based on conventional epidemiology.

Method Between January 27 and February 26, 2020, serial clinical specimens (sputum, nasal and throat swab, anal swab and feces) were collected from a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including 8 mildly and 15 severely ill patients (requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation), in the Guangdong province, China. Total RNA was extracted and ultra-deep metatranscriptomic sequencing was performed in combination with laboratory diagnostic assays. Co-infection rates, the prevalence and abundance of microbial communities in these COVID-19 patients were determined. Findings Notably, respiratory microbial co-infections were exclusively found in 84.6% of severely ill patients (11\/13), among which viral and bacterial co-infections were detected by sequencing in 30.8% (4\/13) and 69.2% (9\/13) of the patients, respectively. In addition, for 23.1% (3\/13) of the patients, bacterial co-infections with Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were also confirmed by bacterial culture. Further, a time-dependent, secondary infection of B. cenocepacia with expressions of multiple virulence genes in one severely ill patient was demonstrated, which might be the primary cause of his disease deterioration and death one month after ICU admission. Interpretation Our findings identified distinct patterns of co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and various respiratory pathogenic microbes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to disease severity. Detection and tracking of BCC-associated nosocomial infections are recommended to improve the pre-emptive treatment regimen and reduce fatal outcomes of hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Methods A prospective European primary care study recruited adults with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection between Nov-Apr 2007-2010. Real-time in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to test for six common respiratory viruses. In this secondary analysis, symptom severity (scored 1=no problem, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe) and symptom duration were compared between groups with different viral aetiologies using regression and Cox proportional hazard models, respectively.

Results The PCR tested positive for a common respiratory virus in 1,354 of the 2,957 (45.8%) included patients. The overall mean symptom score at presentation was 2.09 (95%CI 2.07-2.11) and the median duration until resolution of moderately bad or severe symptoms was 8.70 days (interquartile range 4.50-11.00). Patients with influenza virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus (CoV) or rhinovirus had a significantly higher symptom score than patients with no virus isolated (0.07-0.25 points or 2.3-8.3% higher symptom score).

METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational, multicenter cohort study using prospectively collected data from adult patients hospitalized during influenza virus circulation, for at least 24h, for community-acquired ILI (with symptom onset <7 days). Data were collected from five French teaching hospitals over six consecutive winters (2012-2018). Respiratory viruses were identified by multiplex RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal specimens. hMPV+ patients were compared to hMPV\u2013 patients, influenza+ and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)+ patients using multivariate logistic regressions. Primary outcome was the prevalence of hMPV in patients hospitalized for ILI. RESULTS: Among the 3148 patients included (1449 (46%) women, 1988 (63%) aged 65 and over; 2508 (80%) with chronic disease), at least one respiratory virus was detected in 1604 (51%, 95%CI [49-53]), including 100 cases of hMPV (100\/3148, 3% 95%CI [3, 4]), of which 10 (10%) were viral co-infection. In the hMPV+ patients, mean length of stay was 7 days, 62% (56\/90) developed a complication, 21% (14\/68) were admitted to intensive care unit and 4% (4\/90) died during hospitalization. In comparison with influenza+ patients, hMPV+ patients were more frequently > 65 years old (aOR=3.3, 95%CI[1.9-6.3]) and presented more acute heart failure during hospitalization (aOR=1.8, 95%CI[1.0-2.9]). Compared to RSV+ patients, hMPV+ patients had less cancer (aOR=0.4, 95%CI[0.2-0.9]) and were less likely to smoke (aOR=0.5, 95%CI[0.2-0.9]) but had similar outcomes especially high rate of respiratory and cardiovascular complications. CONCLUSIONS: Adult hMPV infections mainly affect the elderly and patients with chronic conditions and are responsible for frequent cardiac and pulmonary complications similar to those of RSV infections.

Viral\/bacterial genome equivalents were detected in more than two-thirds of specimens. Under immunosuppression, herpesviruses (EBV 30.9%\/14.6%, p < 0.001; CMV 19.6%\/7.9%, p < 0.001; HSV-1: 14.2%\/7.1%, p = 0.012) were frequently observed, mainly through their reactivation in adults. Immunocompromised adults tended to present a higher RSV prevalence (6.4%\/2.4%, p = 0.078). Immunocompetent patients were more frequently tested positive for IV (15.0%\/5.8%, p = 0.001) and M.p. (6.4%\/0.4%, p < 0.001), probably biased due to the influenza pandemic of 2009 and an M.p. epidemic in 2011. About 41.8% of samples were positive for a single pathogen, and among them EBV (19.9%) was most prevalent followed by HRV (18.2%) and IV (16.6%). HSV-2 and C.p. were not found. Marked seasonal effects were observed for HRV, IV, and RSV. Differences in pathogen prevalence were demonstrated between immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. The exact contribution of some herpesviruses to the development of RTI remains unclear.

The majority of acute respiratory tract infections had a viral origin (95%): respiratory syncytial viruses (A and B) (49%), rhinovirus (21%), coronaviruses 229E (11%), humain metapneumovirus (5%), influenza A (3%), influenza H1N1 (1%), adenovirus (2%), and parainfluenza virus type 4 (2%).

CONCLUSION: The clinical spectrum of respiratory infections is complex and often nonspecific. Thus, the early and fast detection of related causative agents is crucial.

This study aimed to evaluate potential laboratory markers for meningitis in febrile infants. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed infants aged <3 months who visited the emergency department of our hospital between May 2012 and May 2017 because of fever of unknown etiology. Clinical information and laboratory data were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed. RESULTS: In total, 145 febrile infants aged <3 months who underwent lumbar punctures were evaluated retrospectively. The mean C-reactive protein (CRP) level was significantly higher in the meningitis group than in the non-meningitis group, whereas the mean white blood cell count or absolute neutrophil count (ANC) did not significantly differ between groups. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for CRP was 0.779 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.701\u20130.858).

FINDINGS: There were 814 laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory illnesses. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of a viral illness was higher for healthcare personnel reporting exposures to ill household members [7.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.4\u20139.1], co-workers (3.4, 95% CI 2.4\u20134.7) or other social contacts (5.1, 95% CI 3.6\u20137.1).

We tested nasopharyngeal wash from both case and control for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza viruses, human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV), rhinovirus and adenovirus by singleplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. To identify the independent association of pneumonia with viral pathogens during February 2016 to March 2017, we used multivariable logistic regression for calculating adjusted odds ratios.

Viruses contribute to 30\u201370% of acute respiratory infections. Identification of these respiratory viruses is not given high priority except influenza; however, the knowledge about prevalence of non-influenza viruses, their seasonal pattern and genetic evolution have significant epidemiological value. METHODS: As a part of National Influenza-like illness surveillance programme, respiratory specimens were collected children and adults with symptoms of ILI or ARI, between January 2012 and March 2015 (including SARI cases). Real-time PCR was done to identify 13 respiratory viruses. Sequencing was done for representative isolates of each virus using ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer. RESULTS: During the study period between January 2012 and March 2015, a total of 648 patients with symptoms of ARI were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 20.2 years (SD = 19.13, median = 18); 292 (45.1%) were children (\u226413 years) and 356 (54.9%) were adults. Respiratory viruses were identified in 44% (287\/648) of all patients. Influenza accounted for the maximum number of cases- 179\/648 (27.6%). Among the non-influenza viruses, RSV predominated with 34 cases (5.2%), followed by HMPV 24 (3.7%) and PIV-3 20 (3%). Four patients died due to INF A\/H1N1 as a result of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (CFR 3.7%). Among the non-influenza viruses, no particular seasonality pattern was observed over the different months of the study period. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic usage in treating acute respiratory infections empirically is not justified as nearly half of ARI are due to viruses; nearly 28% of them were due to influenza viruses. Among the non-influenza viruses, RSV predominated, followed by HMPV. This study is based on an active influenza surveillance initiated after 2009 pandemic influenza outbreak, in the Union territory of Puducherry which has contributed significantly to the knowledge of the burden of influenza and non-influenza viruses among children and adults.

Historically, the diagnosis of viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) can lead to postponement of surgery due to concerns of perioperative complications related to acute illness. Respiratory viral panels (RVP) are often used to confirm the presence of recent or active viral infection and can affect the differential diagnosis of upper airway obstruction. This study examined whether RVP positive testing is correlated with perioperative complications and operative findings in pediatric patients undergoing inpatient DLB. Methods A retrospective chart review of 132 pediatric patient encounters was performed. Viral testing results, DLB indication, DLB findings, and perioperative complications were compared. Results Sixty encounters (45.5%) involved a positive RVP, and 72 (54.5%) involved a negative RVP. Those with positive RVP were less likely to have an anatomic airway abnormality (p = 0.0250) and more likely to have a history of recurrent upper respiratory infections (p = 0.0464). The most common reason for DLB was to assess for structural airway abnormality. Laryngospasm occurred in 1 (1.7%) RVP positive and 1 (1.4%) RVP negative encounter, and 2 (2.8%) RVP negative encounters required reintubation. No other major complications were observed. No association was noted between RVP results and incidence of major or minor complication. Conclusions Major perioperative complications after surgical intervention with DLB for the management of complex, inpatient children with stridor and respiratory distress are rare. RVP positivity, specific pathogens identified on RVP, and presence of URI symptoms were not associated with perioperative complications.","publish_time":1587427200000,"author_summary":" Niermeyer, Weston L.; Ball, Jessica;<br>Worobetz, Noah; Bourgeois, Tran; Onwuka, Amanda;<br>Burrier, Candice; Chiang, Tendy","abstract_summary":" Abstract Objectives Children admitted with<br>stridor and respiratory distress comprise a complex<br>patient group that requires the otolaryngologist to<br>decide when to assess and intervene with direct<br>laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy (DLB).

Little is known about the role of viral-coinfections in the clinical severity in children infected with RSV. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review of publications comparing the clinical severity between RSV mono-infection and RSV co-infection with other viruses in children under five years (<5y). Clinical severity was measured using the following six clinical outcomes: hospitalisation, length of hospital stay, use of supplemental oxygen, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation and deaths. We summarised the findings by clinical outcome and conducted random-effect meta-analyses, where applicable, to quantitatively synthesize the association between RSV mono-infection\/RSV co-infection and the clinical severity. RESULTS: Overall, no differences in the clinical severity were found between RSV mono-infection and RSV co-infection with any viruses, except for the RSV-human metapneumovirus (hMPV) co-infection. RSV-hMPV coinfection was found to be associated with a higher risk of ICU admission (odds ratio (OR) = 7.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.1-25.1; OR after removal of the most influential study was 3.7, 95% CI = 1.1-12.3).

A model-based analysis using a retrospective cohort of all hospitalized children with CSF EV PCR testing done between November 2013 and 2017. The primary outcome measured was the potential date of discharge if the EV PCR result had been available on the same day. Patients with positive EV PCR were considered for potential earlier discharge once clinically stable with no reason for hospitalization other than intravenous antibiotics. Descriptive statistics and cost-sensitivity analyses were performed. CSF EV PCR testing was done on 153 patients, of which 44 (29%) had a positive result.

RESULTS: Out of 3211 potentially relevant articles, we included 22 studies in the systematic review, and 12 studies in 7 random-effects meta-analyses. Highest carriage rates of MDR-E were observed after travel to Southern Asia (median 71%), followed by travel to Northern Africa (median 42%). Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) were identified in 5 out of 22 studies, from a few patients. However, in only eight out of 22 studies (36.4%) the initial laboratory method targeted detection of the presence of CPE in the original samples. The risk factor with the highest pooled odds ratio (OR) for MDR-E was travel to Southern Asia (pooled OR = 14.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.50 to 36.45), followed by antibiotic use during travel (pooled OR = 2.78, 95% CI = 1.76 to 4.39).

Classification of patients with influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) using the current definitions for invasive fungal diseases has proven difficult, and our aim was to develop case definitions for IAPA that can facilitate clinical studies. METHODS: A group of 29 international experts reviewed current insights into the epidemiology, diagnosis and management of IAPA and proposed a case definition of IAPA through a process of informal consensus. RESULTS: Since IAPA may develop in a wide range of hosts, an entry criterion was proposed and not host factors. The entry criterion was defined as a patient requiring ICU admission for respiratory distress with a positive influenza test temporally related to ICU admission. In addition, proven IAPA required histological evidence of invasive septate hyphae and mycological evidence for Aspergillus. Probable IAPA required the detection of galactomannan or positive Aspergillus culture in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or serum with pulmonary infiltrates or a positive culture in upper respiratory samples with bronchoscopic evidence for tracheobronchitis or cavitating pulmonary infiltrates of recent onset.

Pseudomonas was the most common bacteria grown in 31 (29.8%) followed by Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) in three (2.8%) patients. Among viruses, Rhinovirus was the most common, identified in 16 (17.4%) samples followed by coronavirus in four (4.3%). Fungi and mycobacteria were isolated from 23 (22.1%) and four (3.8%) children, respectively. Aspergillus flavus was the most common fungus isolated in 13 (12.5%) children. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Pseudomonas was the most common organism isolated during exacerbation. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria were not isolated, whereas infection with Bcc and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was observed, which could probably have a role in CF morbidity. Polymicrobial infections were associated with severe exacerbations.","publish_time":1578960000000,"author_summary":" Arvind, Balaji; Medigeshi, Guruprasad R.;<br>Kapil, Arti; Xess, Immaculata; Singh, Urvashi;<br>Lodha, Rakesh; Kabra, Sushil Kumar","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary disease is<br>the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic<br>fibrosis (CF).

Currently, clinical detection of UTI is mainly focused on urine culture; however, the diagnostic value of urine culture remains limited due to the time-consuming procedure and low detection rate, especially in patients who have used antibiotics. Generally, treatment for UTI relies on empirical medication rather than pathogen diagnosis, which leads to the inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents and a significant increase in resistant strains. Comparatively, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is capable of overcoming the disadvantages of clinical culture, and identifying pathogens for further treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old male patient was admitted to hospital with a high fever and chills. None of his autoimmune disease or thyroid function related indicators were positive, and he had no risk of endocarditis. His white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, interleukin 6, and neutrophil proportion were markedly elevated. He was initially diagnosed as having an infection of unknown etiology. Since empirical treatment of Sulperazon and Metronidazole did not relieve his symptoms, both the blood and urine specimens were examined using traditional culture, serological testing, and mNGS assay. Traditional culture and serological testing produced negative results, while the mNGS assay revealed the presence of a potential pathogen, Enterococcus faecalis, in the urine specimen, which was further confirmed by both Sanger sequencing and qPCR analysis. A CT scan of the patient\u2019s whole abdomen showed stones in the right kidney. Once targeted antibiotic therapy was administered, the patient recovered quickly. CONCLUSIONS: Our case illustrated that mNGS, as a novel culture-independent approach, demonstrated the capability of rapid, sensitive, and accurate pathogen identification.

METHODS: Two-hundred severe COPD patients from Europe and North America were followed longitudinally for 3 years. We performed nucleic acid detection for 20 respiratory viruses and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to evaluate the bacterial microbiota in 1179 sputum samples collected at stable, acute exacerbation and follow-up visits. RESULTS: Similar viral and bacterial taxa were found in patients from the USA compared to Bulgaria and Czech Republic but their microbiome diversity was significantly different (P < 0.001) and did not impact exacerbation rates. Virus infection was strongly associated with exacerbation events (P < 5E-20). Human rhinovirus (13.1%), coronavirus (5.1%) and influenza virus (3.6%) constitute the top viral pathogens in triggering exacerbation. Moraxella and Haemophilus were 5-fold and 1.6-fold more likely to be the dominating microbiota during an exacerbation event.

In total, 474 specimens were collected and tested. Respiratory viruses were detected more frequently by PCR (357, 75.3%) than they were by traditional tests (229, 49.3%). The leading pathogens were RSV (113, 23.8%), RV (72, 15.2%), PIV3 (53, 11.2%), FluA (51, 10.8%), and ADV (48, 10.1%). For children younger than 5 years, RSV and RV were most prevalent; for children older than 5 years, FluA and ADV were the most frequently detected. Of the specimens, 25.8% (92\/357) were coinfected with two or more viruses. RV, Boca, PIV2, FluB, and PIV4 had higher rates of coinfection; MPV and PIV1 had the lowest rates of coinfection (9.1% and 5.3%). To conclude, the detection power of PCR was better than that of traditional antigen tests and virus cultures when considering the detection of respiratory viruses. RSV and RV were the leading viral pathogens identified in the respiratory specimens. One-quarter of the positive specimens were coinfected with two or more viruses.

We evaluated whether ambulance dispatch calls of highest urgency reflect the circulation of influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenzavirus and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). METHODS: We analysed calls from four ambulance call centres serving 25% of the population in the Netherlands (2014\u20102016). The chief symptom and urgency level is recorded during triage; we restricted our analysis to calls with the highest urgency and identified those compatible with a respiratory syndrome. We modelled the relation between respiratory syndrome calls (RSC) and respiratory virus trends using binomial regression with identity link function. RESULTS: We included 211 739 calls, of which 15 385 (7.3%) were RSC. Proportion of RSC showed periodicity with winter peaks and smaller interseasonal increases. Overall, 15% of RSC were attributable to respiratory viruses (20% in out\u2010of\u2010office hour calls). There was large variation by age group: in <15 years, only RSV was associated and explained 11% of RSC; in 15\u201064 years, only influenza A (explained 3% of RSC); and in \u226565 years adenovirus explained 9% of RSC, distributed throughout the year, and hMPV (4%) and influenza A (1%) mainly during the winter peaks. Additionally, rhinovirus was associated with total RSC. CONCLUSION: High urgency ambulance dispatches reflect the burden of different respiratory viruses and might be useful to monitor the respiratory season overall.

Qatar has a comprehensive surveillance system which includes influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and identification of the influenza and non-influenza viruses causing the infections. Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the viruses causing acute respiratory illness in Qatar during 2013\u20132016. Methodology: Respiratory samples were collected from selected patients using WHO standard case definitions with ILI at the sentinel primary health care centre sites of the National Influenza Centre and patients with SARI admitted to sentinel hospitals. Nasopharyngeal and\/or oropharyngeal swabs were collected from eligible patients (standardized case definitions) for the period 2013\u20132016. Samples were analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction at the National Influenza Centre, which tests for 22 types and subtypes of virus. Findings: In the study period, 43 106 patients were included and tested, 29 626 (68.7%) of whom tested positive for infection. Out of these, 8 829 (29.8%) were influenza positive, 6 655 (75.4%) of whom were influenza A and 2 174 (24.6%) were influenza B. Sub-typing of influenza A showed 3 721 (55.9%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Other respiratory viruses isolated included rhinovirus 4 626 (15.6%), respiratory syncytial virus 3 259 (11.0%), coronaviruses 1 824 (6.2%), adenovirus 1 689 (5.7%), parainfluenza virus 1 645 (5.6%), human metapneumovirus 1 357 (4.6%) Mycoplasma pneumoniae 1 053 (3.6%), bocavirus 874 (3.0%) and parechovirus 178 (0.6%). Seasonal variation was observed for influenza with the peak season being from October to March with an unexpected surge of cases seen in October to December 2016. Conclusions: Influenza viruses A and B are responsible for the majority of the ILI and SARI cases reported in Qatar; however many other viruses also contribute to the burden of respiratory illness in the country. The findings indicate other viral etiologies besides influenza which may influence the clinical management and outcome of the patient.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the associations between bacterial, viral, and bacterial plus viral isolations and bronchiectasis exacerbations. METHODS: In this prospective study, we enrolled 108 patients who were followed up every 3\u20136 months and at onset of exacerbations between March 2017 and November 2018. Spontaneous sputum was split for detection of bacteria (routine culture) and viruses (quantitative polymerase chain reaction). Symptoms and lung function were assessed during exacerbations. RESULTS: The median exacerbation rate was 2.0 (interquartile range: 1.0\u20132.5) per patient-year. At any visit, viral isolations (V+) occurred more frequently during onset of exacerbations [odds ratio (OR): 3.28, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.76\u20136.12], as did isolation of new bacteria (NB+) (OR: 2.52, 95%CI: 1.35\u20134.71) and bacterial plus viral isolations (OR: 2.24, 95%CI: 1.11\u20134.55). Whilst coryza appeared more common in exacerbations with V+ than in exacerbations with no pathogen isolations and those with NB+, lower airway symptoms were more severe in exacerbations with NB+ (P < .05). Sputum interleukin-1\u03b2 levels were higher in exacerbations with NB+ than in exacerbations with no pathogen isolations and those with V+ (both P < .05). Significantly more coryza symptoms correlated with bacterial plus viral isolations at exacerbations (P = .019). Compared with V+ alone, bacterial with and without viral isolations tended to yield more severe lower airway symptoms, but not sputum cytokine levels at exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS: Viral isolations, isolation of new bacteria and bacterial plus viral isolation are associated with bronchiectasis exacerbations. Symptoms at exacerbations might inform clinicians the possible culprit pathogens.","publish_time":1586304000000,"author_summary":" Chen, Chun-Lan; Huang, Yan; Yuan, Jing-Jing;<br>Li, Hui-Min; Han, Xiao-Rong; Martinez-Garcia,<br>Miguel Angel; de la Rosa-Carrillo, David; Chen,<br>Rong-chang; Guan, Wei-Jie; Zhong, Nan-Shan","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: Exacerbations are crucial events<br>during bronchiectasis progression.
