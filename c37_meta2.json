Only a few cases of SENLAT caused by Bartonella henselae have been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old male sought medical advice while suffering from high fever and diarrhea. Three weeks before the visit, he had been hunting a water deer, and upon bringing the deer home discovered a tick on his scalp area. Symptoms occurred one week after hunting, and a lump was palpated on the right neck area 6 days after the onset of symptoms. Physical examination upon presentation confirmed an eschar-like lesion on the right scalp area, and cervical palpation revealed that the lymph nodes on the right side were non-painful and enlarged at 2.5 \u00d7 1.5 cm. Fine needle aspiration of the enlarged lymph nodes was performed, and results of nested PCR for the Bartonella internal transcribed spacer (ITS) confirmed B. henselae as the causative agent.

It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including diffuse alveolar haemorrhage which occurs in a minority of cases but carries a mortality of over 70%. These patients may present with severe acute respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis for diffuse alveolar haemorrhage is broad whereas prompt diagnosis and treatment can be lifesaving. CASE PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old previously fit and well trout farm worker presented with a 3-day history of malaise, fevers, diarrhoea, vomiting and jaundice. He developed haemoptysis, severe headaches, neck stiffness and photophobia on the day of emergency admission. He was anaemic and thrombocytopenic. Anuric acute kidney injury (urea 32, creat 507) required immediate haemofiltration. In view of progressive respiratory failure with four-quadrant lung infiltrates on imaging, he was given broad spectrum antibiotics and pulsed methylprednisolone empirically, in case of a vasculitic pulmonary-renal presentation. He was intubated within 48 h of admission. Despite attempted protective ventilatory management, he remained hypoxaemic and developed pneumomediastinum. He was retrieved to a specialist cardiorespiratory intensive care unit on femoro-femoral mobile VV-ECMO. Three days from admission, results showed positive Leptospira IgM and real-time PCR. Serial bronchoscopies showed old and fresh clots, but not the classical progressive late red tinge of the returned lavage fluid. After eight days, VV-ECMO was weaned, he was extubated three days later, and made a full recovery. At 9 months follow-up, he was clinically better, with resolution of the CT scan findings and near normal lung function, albeit with low normal gas transfer. CONCLUSIONS: Leptospirosis is a rare but important differential to be considered in diffuse alveolar haemorrhage presenting to the ICU, especially in young males. A thorough history for occupational or recreational risk factors may offer the diagnostic clue. Most patients recover fully with antibiotics. However, resulting acute severe respiratory failure can ensue. In this situation, early consideration for respiratory ECMO support offers time for clearance of endobronchial clot, parenchymal recovery, and prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury. Steroids have no clear evidence but may be used to avoid delay in treating suspected vasculitic or autoimmune causes of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage.","publish_time":1587859200000,"author_summary":" Barnacle, James; Gurney, Stefan; Ledot,<br>Stephane; Singh, Suveer","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a potentially<br>fatal zoonosis.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year old male presenting to the outpatient unit with fever, right flank pain, and burning micturition for three days was initially treated for UTI. However, he returned to the hospital on the fourth day of illness with persistent symptoms. He was hospitalized, with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone. Computerized tomography scan of his abdomen-pelvis showed features of acute pyelonephritis, so his antibiotics were upgraded to meropenem and teicoplanin. Despite this, the patient\u2019s condition deteriorated. Laboratory investigations showed multisystem involvement: decreasing platelets, raised creatinine, and deranged liver panel. As Kathmandu was hit by dengue epidemic during the patient\u2019s hospitalization, on the seventh day of his illness, blood samples were sent for tropical fever investigation. All tests came out negative except for scrub typhus\u2014IgM antibodies positive on rapid diagnostic test. The patient\u2019s symptoms subsided after 48 h of starting doxycycline and he became fully asymptomatic four days later. Fever did not recur even after discontinuing other IV antibiotics, favoring scrub typhus disease rather than systemic bacterial sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Scrub typhus is an emerging infectious disease of Nepal. Therefore, every unexplained fever cases (irrespective of clinical presentation) should be evaluated for potential Rickettsiosis.

While the virus is well-known for its trademark effects on respiratory function, neurological damage has been reported to affect a considerable proportion of severe cases. To characterize the neuro-invasive potential of this disease, a contemporary review of COVID-19 and its neurological sequelae was conducted using the limited, but growing, literature that is available. These neurological squeal are based on the manifestations that the virus has on normal central and peripheral nervous system function. The authors present the virology of the SARS-CoV-2 agent by analyzing its classification as an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus. A comprehensive timeline is then presented, indicating the progression of the disease as a public health threat. Furthermore, underlying chronic neurological conditions potentially lead to more adverse cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 may reach ACE2 receptors on neuronal tissue through mode of the general circulation. The CNS may also be susceptible to an immune response where a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d can manifest into neural injury. Histological evidence is provided, while symptoms such as headache and vertigo are highlighted as CNS manifestations of COVID-19. Treatment of these symptoms is addressed with paracetamol being recommended as a possible, but not conclusive, treatment to some CNS symptoms. The authors then discuss the peripheral nervous system sequelae and COVID's impact on causing chemosensory dysfunction starting with viral attack on olfactory sensory neurons and cells types within the lining of the nose. Histological evidence is also provided while symptoms such as anosmia and ageusia are characterized as PNS manifestations. Possible treatment options for these symptoms are then addressed as a major limitation, as anecdotal, and not conclusive evidence can be made. Finally, preventive measures of the neurological sequelae are addressed using a multidirectional approach. Postmortem examinations of the brains of COVID-19 patients are suggested as being a possible key to formulating new understandings of its neuropathology.

Neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, thus it is important to recognize and diagnose the disease entity and treat early. When neuropsychiatric symptoms are involved, typically there are many other systemic features to aid in the diagnosis of SLE. Many autoantibodies have been discovered and are used to help diagnose SLE. The antibody present in most cases of pediatric SLE, as well as in many other rheumatic diseases, is the nonspecific antinuclear antibody (ANA). The ANA is a commonly used screening tool by primary care physicians when evaluating a patient with a possible rheumatic disorder. However, a small subset of SLE patients, 1\u20135%, present with a negative ANA, and it is important to keep SLE on the differential diagnosis in specific instances when a thorough infectious, metabolic and neurological workup has been completed and proven to be inconclusive. CASE PRESENTATION: This case involves a Hispanic adolescent female with a negative ANA who presented with diffuse cerebral edema secondary to leukoencephalopathy due to SLE with central nervous system involvement. She was normotensive on presentation and relatively symptom free aside from headache. She had an extensive workup while inpatient involving metabolic, infectious disease, rheumatology, and neurology prior to obtaining the diagnosis of SLE. She was treated with cyclophosphamide and rituximab with appropriate disease response. CONCLUSIONS: A review of the literature revealed 12 cases with SLE presenting with or developing diffuse cerebral edema and\/or leukoencephalopathy. Our patient\u2019s case differs in that she was also ANA negative despite other autoantibody positivity. While she did have low complements and transient leukopenia, she did not present with other signs of organ involvement, which made the diagnosis of SLE with neuropsychiatric involvement quite challenging. We discuss the importance of keeping SLE on the differential diagnosis despite a negative ANA in complex cases after thorough workup has been unrevealing, and to consider initial screening with not only the ANA but also dsDNA and complements to avoid missed diagnoses.","publish_time":1594598400000,"author_summary":" Theisen, Alexandra; Bose, Paroma; Knight,<br>Christina; Oliver, Melissa","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus<br>(SLE) is an autoimmune disease with various clinical<br>manifestations involving multiple organ systems.<br>Neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE have been associated<br>with increased morbidity and mortality, thus it is<br>important to recognize and diagnose the disease entity<br>and treat early.

An exhaustive search of scientific articles on neurological involvement in COVID-19 was performed in the Web of Science, Scopus, Medline\/PubMed, and several other databases. Nineteen relevant articles that had been published or were in preprint were carefully selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Based on our research, we found that patients with COVID-19 can present with neurological symptoms that can be broadly divided into central nervous system involvement, such as headache, dizziness, altered mental state, and disorientation, and peripheral nervous system involvement, such as anosmia and hypogeusia. Most of these patients are in the older age group and exhibit comorbidities, especially hypertension, and severe infection. In extreme presentations of COVID-19, some patients exhibit seizures, stroke, flaccid paraparesis, corticospinal weakness, and even coma. Moreover, the neurological manifestations can occur independently of the respiratory system.

RESULTS Of 841 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (mean age 66.4 years, 56.2% men) 57.4% developed some form of neurological symptom. Nonspecific symptoms such as myalgias (17.2%), headache (14.1%), and dizziness (6.1%) were present mostly in the early stages of infection.

However, postinfectious complications are also expected. Neurological disorders as sequelae of influenza viruses have been repeatedly documented in the past and include symptoms, signs, and diseases occurring during the acute phase and, not rarely, during follow-up.

For these reasons, the present outbreak calls for the introduction of surveillance systems to monitor changes in the frequency of several immune-mediated neurological diseases. These changes will determine a reorganization of the measures apt to describe the interaction between the virus, the environment, and the host in areas of different dimensions, from local communities to regions with several millions of inhabitants.

Objectives To describe the clinical and laboratory characteristics of hospitalized children who met criteria for the pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (PIMS-TS) and compare these characteristics with other pediatric inflammatory disorders. Design, Setting, and Participants Case series of 58 children from 8 hospitals in England admitted between March 23 and May 16, 2020, with persistent fever and laboratory evidence of inflammation meeting published definitions for PIMS-TS. The final date of follow-up was May 22, 2020. Clinical and laboratory characteristics were abstracted by medical record review, and were compared with clinical characteristics of patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) (n = 1132), KD shock syndrome (n = 45), and toxic shock syndrome (n = 37) who had been admitted to hospitals in Europe and the US from 2002 to 2019. Exposures Signs and symptoms and laboratory and imaging findings of children who met definitional criteria for PIMS-TS from the UK, the US, and World Health Organization. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics of children meeting definitional criteria for PIMS-TS, and comparison with the characteristics of other pediatric inflammatory disorders. Results Fifty-eight children (median age, 9 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 5.7-14]; 33 girls [57%]) were identified who met the criteria for PIMS-TS. Results from SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction tests were positive in 15 of 58 patients (26%) and SARS-CoV-2 IgG test results were positive in 40 of 46 (87%). In total, 45 of 58 patients (78%) had evidence of current or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. All children presented with fever and nonspecific symptoms, including vomiting (26\/58 [45%]), abdominal pain (31\/58 [53%]), and diarrhea (30\/58 [52%]). Rash was present in 30 of 58 (52%), and conjunctival injection in 26 of 58 (45%) cases. Laboratory evaluation was consistent with marked inflammation, for example, C-reactive protein (229 mg\/L [IQR, 156-338], assessed in 58 of 58) and ferritin (610 \u03bcg\/L [IQR, 359-1280], assessed in 53 of 58). Of the 58 children, 29 developed shock (with biochemical evidence of myocardial dysfunction) and required inotropic support and fluid resuscitation (including 23\/29 [79%] who received mechanical ventilation); 13 met the American Heart Association definition of KD, and 23 had fever and inflammation without features of shock or KD. Eight patients (14%) developed coronary artery dilatation or aneurysm. Comparison of PIMS-TS with KD and with KD shock syndrome showed differences in clinical and laboratory features, including older age (median age, 9 years [IQR, 5.7-14] vs 2.7 years [IQR, 1.4-4.7] and 3.8 years [IQR, 0.2-18], respectively), and greater elevation of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (median, 229 mg\/L [IQR 156-338] vs 67 mg\/L [IQR, 40-150 mg\/L] and 193 mg\/L [IQR, 83-237], respectively). Conclusions and Relevance In this case series of hospitalized children who met criteria for PIMS-TS, there was a wide spectrum of presenting signs and symptoms and disease severity, ranging from fever and inflammation to myocardial injury, shock, and development of coronary artery aneurysms. The comparison with patients with KD and KD shock syndrome provides insights into this syndrome, and suggests this disorder differs from other pediatric inflammatory entities.","publish_time":1591574400000,"author_summary":" Whittaker, Elizabeth; Bamford, Alasdair;<br>Kenny, Julia; Kaforou, Myrsini; Jones, Christine E;<br>Shah, Priyen; Ramnarayan, Padmanabhan; Fraisse,<br>Alain; Miller, Owen; Davies, Patrick; Kucera, Filip;<br>Brierley, Joe; McDougall, Marilyn; Carter, Michael;<br>Tremoulet, Adriana; Shimizu, Chisato; Herberg, Jethro;<br>Burns, Jane C; Lyall, Hermione; Levin, Michael","abstract_summary":" Importance In communities with high rates of<br>coronavirus disease 2019, reports have emerged of children<br>with an unusual syndrome of fever and inflammation.<br>Objectives To describe the clinical and laboratory<br>characteristics of hospitalized children who met criteria for<br>the pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome<br>temporally associated with severe acute respiratory<br>syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (PIMS-TS) and<br>compare these characteristics with other pediatric<br>inflammatory disorders.

Although the main clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is respiratory involvement, there is evidence suggesting the neuroinvasive potential of COVID-19. There are limited reports of neurological complications of COVID-19 infection in the literature. Herein, we aim to describe 2 members of a family affected by COVID-19, presenting with ascending paresthesia with the final diagnosis of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. CASE REPORT A 38-year-old man presented with a history of ascending paresthesia and bilateral facial droop since 5 days before admission. The medical history was positive for flu-like symptoms affecting all the members of his family. The neurological examination was notable for bilateral peripheral facial paralysis, generalized areflexia, and derceased sensation in distal limbs. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed an albuminocytologic dissociation. In addition, the electromyography-nerve conduction study findings were suggestive of acute axonal-demyelinating polyneuropathy. Meanwhile the patient was treated with a diagnosis of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, his 14-year-old daughter presented with a history of progressive paresthesia and weakness. Similar to her father, the paraclinical evaluations were consistent with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Taking into account clinical findings and the outbreak of COVID-19, the suspicion of COVID-19 was proposed. Eventually, on the basis of throat swab samples stand on polymerase chain reaction, the patients were diagnosed with COVID-19.

He scored qSOFA 1 of 3 points due to high respiratory rate, and SIRS 2 of 4 points due to high respiratory rate and fever of 39.4\u00ba C. PCR for influenza virus was negative and he received benzylpenicillin for pneumonia. The chest X-ray taken initially showed no lung affection.

Observations This review serves to summarize available information regarding coronaviruses in the nervous system, identify the potential tissue targets and routes of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system, and describe the range of clinical neurological complications that have been reported thus far in COVID-19 and their potential pathogenesis. Viral neuroinvasion may be achieved by several routes, including transsynaptic transfer across infected neurons, entry via the olfactory nerve, infection of vascular endothelium, or leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier. The most common neurologic complaints in COVID-19 are anosmia, ageusia, and headache, but other diseases, such as stroke, impairment of consciousness, seizure, and encephalopathy, have also been reported. Conclusions and Relevance Recognition and understanding of the range of neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 may lead to improved clinical outcomes and better treatment algorithms. Further neuropathological studies will be crucial to understanding the pathogenesis of the disease in the central nervous system, and longitudinal neurologic and cognitive assessment of individuals after recovery from COVID-19 will be crucial to understand the natural history of COVID-19 in the central nervous system and monitor for any long-term neurologic sequelae.","publish_time":1590710400000,"author_summary":" Zubair, Adeel S; McAlpine, Lindsay S; Gardin,<br>Tova; Farhadian, Shelli; Kuruvilla, Deena E;<br>Spudich, Serena","abstract_summary":" Importance Severe acute respiratory syndrome<br>coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019,<br>causing human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),<br>which has now spread into a worldwide pandemic.

New-onset neurologic events as assessed by neurology consultants based on manifestations, clinical examination and investigations, in which critical events included disorders of consciousness, stroke, CNS infection, seizures and status epilepticus. RESULTS We enrolled 917 people with average age 48.7 years and 55% were male. The frequency of new onset critical neurologic events was 3.5% (32\/917) overall and 9.4% (30\/319) among those with severe or critical COVID-19. These were impaired consciousness (n=25) or\/and stroke (n=10). The risk of critical neurologic events was highly associated with age above 60 years and previous history of neurological conditions. Non-critical events were seen in less than 1% (7\/917), including muscle cramp, unexplained headache, occipital neuralgia, tic and tremor. Brain CT in 28 people led to new findings in nine. Findings from lumbar puncture in three with suspected CNS infection, unexplained headache or severe occipital neuralgia were unremarkable. CONCLUSIONS People with COVID-19 aged over 60 and neurologic comorbidities were at higher risk of developing critical neurologic impairment, mainly impaired consciousness and cerebrovascular accidents. Brain CT should be considered when new-onset brain injury is suspected, especially in people under sedation or showing an unexplained decline in consciousness.

METHODS For this purpose, the MR images of 9 patients with a common pattern of abnormal findings (2 women\/7 men; 55-79 years of age; mean age: 67.7 years) were depicted. All patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and presented with delayed recovery of consciousness or important agitation, requiring brain MRI. RESULTS All patients had suffered from severe (5\/9) or moderate (4\/9) acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring prolonged stay in the intensive care unit.

Other uncommon locations of microbleeds were the internal capsule (5\/9), as well as middle cerebellar peduncles (5\/9). Subcortical regions were also affected in the majority of patients. CONCLUSIONS Brain MRI raised evidence that Covid-19 or its related treatment may involve the brain with an unusual pattern of microbleeds, predominantly affecting the corpus callosum.

Methods: Over a two-month period contemporary with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France and Switzerland, we retrospectively collected clinical, biological, therapeutic, and early outcomes data in children who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units in 14 centers for cardiogenic shock, left ventricular dysfunction and severe inflammatory state. Results: Thirty-five children were identified and included in the study. Median age at admission was 10 years (range 2-16 years). Co-morbidities were present in 28% including asthma and overweight. Gastrointestinal symptoms were prominent. Left ventricular ejection fraction was <30% in one third; 80% required inotropic support with 28% treated with ECMO. Inflammation markers were suggestive of cytokine storm (interleukin 6 median 135 pg\/mL) and macrophage activation (D-dimer median 5284 ng\/mL). Mean brain natriuretic peptide was elevated (5743 pg\/mL). Thirty-one\/35 (88%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR of nasopharyngeal swab or serology. All patients received intravenous immune globulin, with adjunctive steroid therapy used in one third. Left ventricular function was restored in the 25\/35 of those discharged from the intensive care unit. No patient died, and all patients treated with ECMO were successfully weaned. Conclusion: Children may experience an acute cardiac decompensation due to severe inflammatory state following SARS-CoV-2 infection (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children - MIS-C).

DATA SOURCES A PubMed search was performed in Clinical Queries using the key terms \"macrophage activation syndrome or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)\" and \"Kawasaki disease\". RESULTS KD patients with MAS show high intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resistance and coronary complications. Mortality is also as high as MAS in other diseases. Persistent fever greater than 10 days is highly associated with development of MAS in KD. Splenomegaly is observed in more than two-thirds of KD patients with MAS. Thrombocytopenia is often the earliest laboratory finding of MAS. Hyperferritinemia is highly specific and sensitive for detecting MAS in KD; so, ferritin levels should be checked if there are unexplained clinical exacerbations in KD patients. Given the under-recognition of MAS in KD, it is prudent to consider resistant KD as occult\/subclinical MAS. Many KD patients with MAS have good outcomes on immune modulators. However, if KD patients fulfill the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria, they may undergo longer and more intensive treatment than needed.

Early diagnosis of atypical cases of COVID-19 infection is critical in reducing the transmission and controlling the present pandemic. In the present report, we described a patient with the chief complaints of dyspnea and dry cough referred to the oncology center at Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran with the differential diagnosis of lung cancer who was diagnosed and treated for COVID-19 infection in follow up. CASE PRESENTATION A 59-year-old patient complained of fever, dry cough, and dyspnea from two weeks ago. The patient had been referred to this center with the differential diagnosis of lung cancer due to the massive pleural effusion in initial chest CT scan. Dyspnea was the patient's main complaint at the time of admission in this center and the oxygen saturation was 84%. In the new chest CT scan, similar findings were observed. Due to the severe respiratory distress, a chest tube was placed in the chest cavity to remove the pleural effusion fluid on day one. The patient's felt relieved immediately after the procedure; however, the oxygen saturation did not raise above 85% despite the oxygen therapy. The cytology of pleural fluid was negative for malignant cells. On day 2, the lymphopenia and high level of CRP suggested the COVID-19 infection. Therefore, a control chest CT scan was conducted and the test for COVID-19 was performed. The CT report indicated the clear pattern of COVID-19's lung involvement in the absence of pleural effusion. Thus, the treatment for COVID-19 was immediately initiated. On day 4, the test reported positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSION Currently, it is important to bear in mind the COVID-19 infection in evaluating the patients with respiratory symptoms. This report indicated how misleading the presentation of chest CT scan could be in clinical judgment. Therefore, we recommend ruling out the COVID-19 infection in all the patients with any pattern of lung involvement to avoid missing the potential cases of this vicious infection.","publish_time":1591660800000,"author_summary":" Ahmadinejad, Zahra; Salahshour, Faeze;<br>Dadras, Omid; Rezaei, Hesan; Alinaghi, SyyedAhmad","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND Recently, COVID-19 infection has<br>become a public health concern.

Objective To report the neurological manifestations of children with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants In this case-series study, patients younger than 18 years who presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection and neurological symptoms to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children (London, UK) between March 1, 2020, and May 8, 2020, were included after infection was confirmed by either a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay by nasopharyngeal swab or a positive test result for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinical and paraclinical features were retrieved from electronic patient records. Results Of the 27 children with COVID-19 pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, 4 patients (14.8%) who were previously healthy had new-onset neurological symptoms. Symptoms included encephalopathy, headaches, brainstem and cerebellar signs, muscle weakness, and reduced reflexes. All 4 patients required intensive care unit admission for the treatment of COVID-19 pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Splenium signal changes were seen in all 4 patients on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. In the 2 patients whose cerebrospinal fluid was tested, samples were acellular, with no evidence of infection on polymerase chain reaction or culture (including negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction results) and negative oligoclonal band test results. In all 3 patients who underwent electroencephalography, a mild excess of slow activity was found. Tests for N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, and aquaporin-4 autoantibodies had negative results in all patients. In all 3 patients who underwent nerve conduction studies and electromyography, mild myopathic and neuropathic changes were seen. Neurological improvement was seen in all patients, with 2 making a complete recovery by the end of the study. Conclusions and Relevance In this case-series study, children with COVID-19 presented with new neurological symptoms involving both the central and peripheral nervous systems and splenial changes on imaging, in the absence of respiratory symptoms. Additional research is needed to assess the association of neurological symptoms with immune-mediated changes among children with COVID-19.","publish_time":1593561600000,"author_summary":" Abdel-Mannan, Omar; Eyre, Michael; L\u00f6bel,<br>Ulrike; Bamford, Alasdair; Eltze, Christin; Hameed,<br>Biju; Hemingway, Cheryl; Hacohen, Yael","abstract_summary":" Importance Neurological manifestations have<br>been reported in adults with coronavirus disease<br>2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the highly<br>pathogenic virus severe acute respiratory syndrome<br>coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

These numbers are still rising daily. Most (some 80%) cases of COVID\u201119 infection are asymptomatic, a substantial number of cases (15%) require hospitalization and an additional fraction of patients (5%) need recovery in intensive care units. Mortality for COVID\u201119 infection appears to occur globally between 0.1 and 0.5% of infected patients although the frequency of lethality is significantly augmented in the elderly and in patients with other comorbidities. The development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and episodes of thromboembolism that may lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) represent the primary causes of lethality during COVID\u201119 infection. Increasing evidence suggests that thrombotic diathesis is due to multiple derangements of the coagulation system including marked elevation of D\u2011dimer that correlate negatively with survival. We propose here that the thromboembolic events and eventually the development of DIC provoked by SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 infection may represent a secondary anti\u2011phospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). We will apply both Baconian inductivism and Cartesian deductivism to prove that secondary APS is likely responsible for coagulopathy during the course of COVID\u201119 infection.

This crisis is also negatively impacting the care of patients with non-COVID-19 conditions, including those with cerebellar ataxia (CA). Older patients with CA and those with immune-mediated ataxias on immunosuppressive medication are potentially at high risk of developing serious complications of the infection, although it is also possible that immunosuppressive agents may provide a defense against cytokine storm. This has implications for even greater attention to preventing contracting the disease through physical distancing and\/or isolation. The CA patient population is also at higher risk because of the neurological complexities of their underlying disorder and the comorbid medical illnesses that often accompany the genetic ataxias. As the disruption of social patterns and healthcare delivery in response to the crisis continues, interruption of rehabilitation, speech and language therapy, and face-to-face consultations threatens to have a negative impact on the course and well-being of CA patients. Mental and physical health is also potentially at greater risk because the prevailing uncertainty and anxiety may be superimposed upon cerebellum-specific neuropsychological challenges. We identify and review some of the short- and long-term consequences of this global pandemic for the community of ataxia patients and their families and for the clinical and academic neurologists\/ataxiologists caring for these patients. This includes the recognition that telemedicine has emerged as a principle means of caregiver-patient contact and that neurological manifestations of COVID-19 including those specific to cerebellar neurobiology are increasingly recognized and will require close surveillance and monitoring.

Cases are divided by disease groups and, within each disease group, results are listed in chronological order or publication date. We also discuss briefly recommendations for neurological patients, according to disease group. Conclusion: Although there is evidence of neurological manifestations with previous coronaviruses, COVID-19 is assuring a volume of published papers not seen before for other coronavirus infections. Most neurological cases are not life-threatening, but 10 to 20% of cases will require hospitalization and are in risk for sequelae and death. Although a lot of data coming from these papers is amassing, researchers must bear in mind that many papers currently published are not yet peer-reviewed, and thus are prone to further corrections.","publish_time":1590451200000,"author_summary":" Mei, P.

Results: All children with MIS-C had high titers of SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG antibodies, which correlated strongly with neutralizing antibodies (R2=0.667, P<0.001). Children with MIS-C had significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG antibody titers (geometric mean titer [GMT] 6800, 95%CI 3495-13231) than children with COVID-19 (GMT 626, 95%CI 251-1563, P<0.001), children with KD (GMT 124, 95%CI 91-170, P<0.001) and other hospitalized pediatric controls (GMT 85 [all below assay limit of detection], P<0.001). All children with MIS-C also had detectable RBD IgM antibodies, indicating recent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Some sparse case reports have described various forms of encephalitis in COVID-19 disease, but very few data have focused on clinical presentations, clinical course, response to treatment and outcomes yet. Objective: to describe the clinical phenotype, laboratory and neuroimaging findings of encephalitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, their relationship with respiratory function and inflammatory parameters and their clinical course and response to treatment. Design: The ENCOVID multicentre study was carried out in 13 centres in northern Italy between February 20th and May 31st, 2020. Only patients with altered mental status and at least two supportive criteria for encephalitis with full infectious screening, CSF, EEG, MRI data and a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Clinical presentation and laboratory markers, severity of COVID-19 disease, response to treatment and outcomes were recorded. Results: Out of 45 cases screened, twenty-five cases of encephalitis positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection with full available data were included. The most common symptoms at onset were delirium (68%), aphasia\/dysarthria (24%) and seizures (24%). CSF showed hyperproteinorrachia and\/or pleocytosis in 68% of cases whereas SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR resulted negative. Based on MRI, cases were classified as ADEM (n=3), limbic encephalitis (LE, n=2), encephalitis with normal imaging (n=13) and encephalitis with MRI alterations (n=7). ADEM and LE cases showed a delayed onset compared to the other encephalitis (p=0.001) and were associated with previous more severe COVID-19 respiratory involvement.

The neuroinvasive potential of CoVs might be responsible for at least part of these symptoms and may contribute to the respiratory failure observed in affected patients. Therefore, in the present manuscript, we have reviewed the available preclinical evidence on the mechanisms and consequences of CoVs-induced CNS damage, and highlighted the potential role of CoVs in determining or aggravating acute and long-term neurological diseases in infected individuals. We consider that a widespread awareness of the significant neurotropism of CoVs might contribute to an earlier recognition of the signs and symptoms of viral-induced CNS damage. Moreover, a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which CoVs affect CNS function and cause CNS damage could help in planning new strategies for prognostic evaluation and targeted therapeutic intervention.","publish_time":1593648000000,"author_summary":" Cataldi, Mauro; Pignataro, Giuseppe;<br>Taglialatela, Maurizio","abstract_summary":" In the first two decades of the 21st century,<br>there have been three outbreaks of severe<br>respiratory infections caused by highly pathogenic<br>coronaviruses (CoVs) around the world: the severe acute<br>respiratory syndrome (SARS) by the SARS-CoV in 2002\u20132003,<br>the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) by the<br>MERS-CoV in June 2012, and Coronavirus Disease 2019<br>(COVID-19) by the SARS-CoV-2 presently affecting most<br>countries In all of these, fatalities are a consequence of<br>a multiorgan dysregulation caused by<br>pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and circulatory damage;<br>however, COVID patients may show significant<br>neurological signs and symptoms such as headache, nausea,<br>vomiting, and sensory disturbances,...","title_summary":" Neurobiology of coronaviruses: Potential<br>relevance for COVID-19","x":24.0758743286,"y":-25.0697917938,"cluster":37,"cluster_name":"c38","cluster_description":"Covid-19 Patients","tsne_x":24.0758743286,"tsne_y":-25.0697917938,"subcluster":17,"subcluster_description":"Central Nervous System","shape":"p"},{"cord_uid":"63en895x","source_x":"Elsevier; Medline; PMC","title":"Features of COVID-19 post-infectious cytokine release syndrome in children presenting to the emergency department","doi":"10.1016\/j.ajem.2020.05.058","abstract":"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has not appeared to affect children as severely as adults.

Increasing evidence shows that these coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also neuroinvasive and neurotropic, with potential neuropathological consequences in vulnerable populations. The aim of this study is to predict a likely CNS involvement by SARS-CoV-2 by studying the pathogenic mechanisms in common with other better known and studied coronaviruses with which it shares the same characteristics. Understanding the mechanisms of neuroinvasion and interaction of HCoV (including SARS-Cov-2) with the CNS is essential to evaluate potentially pathological short- and long-term consequences. Autopsies of the COVID-19 patients, detailed neurological investigation, and attempts to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from the endothelium of cerebral microcirculation, cerebrospinal fluid, glial cells, and neuronal tissue can clarify the role played by COVID-19 in CNS-involvement and in the ongoing mortalities as has been in the recent outbreak.","publish_time":1594080000000,"author_summary":" Armocida, Daniele; Palmieri, Mauro; Frati,<br>Alessandro; Santoro, Antonio; Pesce, Alessandro","abstract_summary":" Italy is currently one of the countries most<br>affected by the global emergency of COVID-19, a lethal<br>disease of a novel coronavirus renamed as SARS-CoV-2.<br>SARS-CoV-2 shares highly homological sequence with the<br>most studied SARS-CoV, and causes acute, highly<br>deadly pneumonia (COVID-19) with clinical symptoms<br>similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.<br>Increasing evidence shows that these coronaviruses are<br>not always confined to the respiratory tract and<br>that they may also neuroinvasive and neurotropic,<br>with potential neuropathological consequences in<br>vulnerable populations.

RESULTS: At physical examination the patient presented with a slightly increased heart rate and a painful and enlarged thyroid on palpation. At laboratory exams free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine were high, thyrotropin undetectable, and inflammatory markers and white blood cell count elevated. Bilateral and diffuse hypoechoic areas were detected at neck ultrasound. One month earlier, thyroid function and imaging both were normal. We diagnosed SAT and the patient started prednisone.

It appears that around one third of COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) for respiratory difficulties exhibit neurologic symptoms. This may be due to progressive brain damage and dysfunction triggered by severe hypoxia and hypoxemia, heightened inflammation and SARS-CoV-2 dissemination into brain parenchyma, as suggested by current reports and analyses of previous CoV outbreaks. Viral invasion of the brain may particularly target and alter brainstem and thalamic functions and, consequently, result in sensorimotor dysfunctions and psychiatric disorders. Moreover, data collected from other structurally homologous CoV suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to brain cell degeneration and demyelination similar to multiple sclerosis (MS). Hence, current evidence warrants further evaluation and long-term follow-up of possible neurologic sequelae in COVID-19 patients. It may be particularly relevant to evaluate brainstem integrity in recovered patients, as it is suspected that this cerebral area may particularly be dysfunctional following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS: Multicentre compilation of patients with KD in Paris region since April 2020, associated with the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (\u2018Kawa-COVID-19\u2019). A historical cohort of \u2018classical\u2019 KD served as a comparator. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were included (sex ratio=1, median age 10 years IQR (4\u00b77 to 12.5)). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 11 cases (69%), while a further five cases had documented recent contact with a quantitative PCR-positive individual (31%). Cardiac involvement included myocarditis in 44% (n=7). Factors prognostic for the development of severe disease (ie, requiring intensive care, n=7) were age over 5 years and ferritinaemia >1400 \u00b5g\/L. Only five patients (31%) were successfully treated with a single intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) infusion, while 10 patients (62%) required a second line of treatment. The Kawa-COVID-19 cohort differed from a comparator group of \u2018classical\u2019 KD by older age at onset 10 vs 2 years (p<0.0001), lower platelet count (188 vs 383 G\/L (p<0.0001)), a higher rate of myocarditis 7\/16 vs 3\/220 (p=0.0001) and resistance to first IVIg treatment 10\/16 vs 45\/220 (p=0.004).

METHODS: We did a multicentre observational study of children (aged <18 years), admitted to PICUs in the UK between April 1 and May 10, 2020, fulfilling the case definition of PIMS-TS published by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. We analysed routinely collected, de-identified data, including demographic details, presenting clinical features, underlying comorbidities, laboratory markers, echocardiographic findings, interventions, treatments, and outcomes; serology information was collected if available. PICU admission rates of PIMS-TS were compared with historical trends of PICU admissions for four similar inflammatory conditions (Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome, haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and macrophage activation syndrome). FINDINGS: 78 cases of PIMS-TS were reported by 21 of 23 PICUs in the UK. Historical data for similar inflammatory conditions showed a mean of one (95% CI 0\u00b785\u20131\u00b722) admission per week, compared to an average of 14 admissions per week for PIMS-TS and a peak of 32 admissions per week during the study period. The median age of patients was 11 years (IQR 8\u201314). Male patients (52 [67%] of 78) and those from ethnic minority backgrounds (61 [78%] of 78) were over-represented. Fever (78 [100%] patients), shock (68 [87%]), abdominal pain (48 [62%]), vomiting (49 [63%]), and diarrhoea (50 [64%]) were common presenting features. Longitudinal data over the first 4 days of admission showed a serial reduction in C-reactive protein (from a median of 264 mg\/L on day 1 to 96 mg\/L on day 4), D-dimer (4030 \u03bcg\/L to 1659 \u03bcg\/L), and ferritin (1042 \u03bcg\/L to 757 \u03bcg\/L), whereas the lymphocyte count increased to more than 1\u00b70 \u00d7 10(9) cells per L by day 3 and troponin increased over the 4 days (from a median of 157 ng\/mL to 358 ng\/mL). 36 (46%) of 78 patients were invasively ventilated and 65 (83%) needed vasoactive infusions; 57 (73%) received steroids, 59 (76%) received intravenous immunoglobulin, and 17 (22%) received biologic therapies. 28 (36%) had evidence of coronary artery abnormalities (18 aneurysms and ten echogenicity). Three children needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and two children died. INTERPRETATION: During the study period, the rate of PICU admissions for PIMS-TS was at least 11-fold higher than historical trends for similar inflammatory conditions. Clinical presentations and treatments varied. Coronary artery aneurysms appear to be an important complication. Although immediate survival is high, the long-term outcomes of children with PIMS-TS are unknown.

Headache showed tension-type features and was more frequently associated with a history of headache. Patients with ODs less frequently needed oxygen therapy. Inflammatory indices did not significantly differ between patients with and without ODs.

COVID-19 patients mostly show respiratory distress first, then diarrhea, anorexia, stroke, or loss of consciousness comes into view. Obviously, GI invasion is a mechanical process that begins with oral invasion and, therefore, most probably exists before the brain invasion, as indicated in case reports. However, when the GI tract is invaded, the virus may enter the central nervous system through vascular and lymphatic systems or the vagal nerve. SARS-CoV-2 can infect leukocytes and migrate with them into the brain, or the viral particles can be directly transported across the blood-brain barrier to the brain. Also, more recent research has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the peripheral lymphatic vessels connecting with the glymphatic system of the brain.

RESULTS: Moderate to severe progression of the lung infiltrates, with increasing percentage of high-density infiltrates sustained by a bilateral and multi-segmental extension of lung opacities, were seen. During the follow-up, apart from pleural effusions, a tubular and enlarged appearance of pulmonary vessels with a sudden caliber reduction was seen, mainly found in the dichotomic tracts, where the center of a new insurgent pulmonary lesion was seen. It could be an early alert radiological sign to predict initial lung deterioration. Another uncommon element was the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy with short-axis oval nodes.

This is a case series performed at 4 academic tertiary care centers in Paris of all the children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with shock, fever and suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection between April 15th and April 27th, 2020. RESULTS: 20 critically ill children admitted for shock had an acute myocarditis (left ventricular ejection fraction, 35% (25\u201355); troponin, 269 ng\/mL (31\u20134607)), and arterial hypotension with mainly vasoplegic clinical presentation. The first symptoms before PICU admission were intense abdominal pain and fever for 6 days (1\u201310). All children had highly elevated C-reactive protein (> 94 mg\/L) and procalcitonin (> 1.6 ng\/mL) without microbial cause. At least one feature of Kawasaki disease was found in all children (fever, n = 20, skin rash, n = 10; conjunctivitis, n = 6; cheilitis, n = 5; adenitis, n = 2), but none had the typical form. SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology were positive for 10 and 15 children, respectively. One child had both negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology, but had a typical SARS-CoV-2 chest tomography scan. All children but one needed an inotropic\/vasoactive drug support (epinephrine, n = 12; milrinone, n = 10; dobutamine, n = 6, norepinephrine, n = 4) and 8 were intubated.

CONCLUSIONS: Acute myocarditis with intense systemic inflammation and atypical Kawasaki disease is an emerging severe pediatric disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Early recognition of this disease is needed and referral to an expert center is recommended. A delayed and inappropriate host immunological response is suspected.

Severe forms of acute respiratory failure can develop. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 may affect organs other than the lung, such as the liver, with frequent onset of late cholestasis. We here report the histological findings of a COVID-19 patient, affected by a tardive complication of acute ischemic and gangrenous cholecystitis with a perforated and relaxed gallbladder needing urgent surgery. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old Caucasian male, affected by acute respiratory failure secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU). Due to the severity of the disease, invasive mechanical ventilation was instituted and SARS-CoV-2 treatment (azithromycin 250 mg once-daily and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg trice-daily) started. Enoxaparin 8000 IU twice-daily was also administered subcutaneously. At day 8 of ICU admission, the clinical condition improved and patient was extubated. At day 32, patient revealed abdominal pain without signs of peritonism at examination, with increased inflammatory and cholestasis indexes at blood tests. At a first abdominal CT scan, perihepatic effusion and a relaxed gallbladder with dense content were detected. The surgeon decided to wait and see the evolution of clinical conditions. The day after, conditions further worsened and a laparotomic cholecystectomy was performed. A relaxed and perforated ischemic gangrenous gallbladder, with a local tissue inflammation and perihepatic fluid, was intraoperatively met. The gallbladder and a sample of omentum, adherent to the gallbladder, were also sent for histological examination. Hematoxylin-eosin-stained slides display inflammatory infiltration and endoluminal obliteration of vessels, with wall breakthrough, hemorrhagic infarction, and nerve hypertrophy of the gallbladder. The mucosa of the gallbladder appears also atrophic. Omentum vessels also appear largely thrombosed. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates an endothelial overexpression of medium-size vessels (anti-CD31), while not in micro-vessels, with a remarkable activity of macrophages (anti-CD68) and T helper lymphocytes (anti-CD4) against gallbladder vessels. All these findings define a histological diagnosis of vasculitis of the gallbladder. CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic gangrenous cholecystitis can be a tardive complication of COVID-19, and it is characterized by a dysregulated host inflammatory response and thrombosis of medium-size vessels.","publish_time":1593648000000,"author_summary":" Bruni, Andrea; Garofalo, Eugenio; Zuccal\u00e0,<br>Valeria; Curr\u00f2, Giuseppe; Torti, Carlo; Navarra,<br>Giuseppe; De Sarro, Giovambattista; Navalesi, Paolo;<br>Longhini, Federico; Ammendola, Michele","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: Since its first documentation, a<br>novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection has<br>emerged worldwide, with the consequent declaration of<br>a pandemic disease (COVID-19).

Recent studies documented that SARS-Coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV2), responsible for COVID-19, can affect the nervous system. The aim of the present observational study was to prospectively assess subjective neurological symptoms (sNS) in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. METHODS: We included patients hospitalized at the University Hospital of Rome Tor Vergata, medical center dedicated to the treatment of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis, who underwent an anamnestic interview about sNS consisting of 13 items, each related to a specific symptom, requiring a dichotomized answer. RESULTS: We included 103 patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Ninety-four patients (91.3%) reported at least one sNS. Sleep impairment was the most frequent symptom, followed by dysgeusia, headache, hyposmia, and depression. Women more frequently complained hyposmia, dysgeusia, dizziness, numbeness\/paresthesias, daytime sleepiness, and muscle ache. Moreover, muscle ache and daytime sleepiness were more frequent in the first 2 days after admission. Conversely, sleep impairment was more frequent in patients with more than 7 days of hospitalization. In these patients we also documented higher white blood cells and lower C-reactive protein levels. These laboratory findings correlated with the occurrence of hyposmia, dysgeusia, headache, daytime sleepiness, and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SARS-CoV2 infection frequently present with sNS. These symptoms were present from the early phases of the disease. The possibly intrinsic neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV2 may justify the very high frequency of sNS. Further studies targeted at investigating the consequences of SARS-CoV2 infection on the CNS should be planned.","publish_time":1589846400000,"author_summary":" Liguori, Claudio; Pierantozzi, Mariangela;<br>Spanetta, Matteo; Sarmati, Loredana; Cesta, Novella;<br>Iannetta, Marco; Ora, Josuel; Genga Mina, Grazia;<br>Puxeddu, Ermanno; Balbi, Ottavia; Pezzuto, Gabriella;<br>Magrini, Andrea; Rogliani, Paola; Andreoni, Massimo;<br>Biagio Mercuri, Nicola","abstract_summary":" OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019<br>(COVID-19) represents a novel pneumonia leading to severe<br>acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

It is reported that a variety of symptoms and syndromes such as headache, dizziness, confusion, ataxia, epilepsy, ischemic stroke, neuropathic pain and myopathy are common especially in more severe COVID-19 patients. It is also suggested that the development of neurological complications is strongly associated with a poor outcome. On the other hand, hyposmia can be the unique symptom in COVID-19 carriers and this can serve as a marker for identifying the otherwise asymptomatically infected patients. It is thought that SARS-CoV-2 may cause neurological symptoms through direct or indirect mechanisms. Nevertheless, neuroinvasion capability of SARS-CoV2 is confirmed by the presence of the virus, in the cerebrospinal fluid of a COVID-19 patient with encephalitis, and this is proven by gene sequencing. In conclusion, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to be aware of the possible neurological complications of the disease.

Respiratory failure, the lethal manifestation of COVID-19, responsible for 215,461 deaths worldwide, is probably neurogenic in origin and may result from the viral invasion of cranial nerve I, progressing into rhinencephalon and brainstem respiratory centers. Cerebrovascular disease, in particular large-vessel ischemic strokes, and less frequently cerebral venous thrombosis, intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage, usually occur as part of a thrombotic state induced by viral attachment to ACE2 receptors in endothelium causing widespread endotheliitis, coagulopathy, arterial and venous thromboses. Acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy is associated to the cytokine storm. A frontal hypoperfusion syndrome has been identified.

Approximately 36% of those with severe COVID-19 experience neurological complications. The virus may enter the central nervous system through the olfactory nerve in the nasal cavity and damage neurons in the brainstem nuclei involved in the regulation of respiration. Patients with cerebellar ataxia (CA) are particularly vulnerable to severe outcome if they contract COVID-19 because of the complexity of their disease, the presence of comorbidities, and their use of immunosuppressive therapies. Most CA patients burdened by progressive neurologic deficits have substantially impaired mobility and other essential functions, for which they rely heavily on ambulatory services, including rehabilitation and psychosocial care.

This international panel of ataxia experts provides recommendations for neurologists caring for patients with CA, emphasizing a pro-active approach designed to maintain their autonomy and well-being: continue long-term medications, promote rehabilitation efforts, utilize the technology of virtual visits for regular contact with healthcare providers, and pay attention to emotional and psychosocial health. Neurologists should play an active role in decision-making in those CA cases requiring escalation to intensive care and resuscitation. Multi-disciplinary collaboration between care teams is always important, and never more so than in the context of the current pandemic.","publish_time":1590105600000,"author_summary":" Manto, Mario; Dupre, Nicolas;<br>Hadjivassiliou, Marios; Louis, Elan D.; Mitoma, Hiroshi;<br>Molinari, Marco; Shaikh, Aasef G.; Soong, Bing-Wen;<br>Strupp, Michael; Van Overwalle, Frank; Schmahmann,<br>Jeremy D.","abstract_summary":" The severe acute respiratory syndrome<br>coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), the cause of the current<br>pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),<br>primarily targets the respiratory system.

The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) established active, statewide surveillance to describe hospitalized patients with the syndrome. METHODS: Hospitals in New York State reported cases of Kawasaki\u2019s disease, toxic shock syndrome, myocarditis, and potential MIS-C in hospitalized patients younger than 21 years of age and sent medical records to the NYSDOH. We carried out descriptive analyses that summarized the clinical presentation, complications, and outcomes of patients who met the NYSDOH case definition for MIS-C between March 1 and May 10, 2020. RESULTS: As of May 10, 2020, a total of 191 potential cases were reported to the NYSDOH. Of 95 patients with confirmed MIS-C (laboratory-confirmed acute or recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection) and 4 with suspected MIS-C (met clinical and epidemiologic criteria), 53 (54%) were male; 31 of 78 (40%) were black, and 31 of 85 (36%) were Hispanic. A total of 31 patients (31%) were 0 to 5 years of age, 42 (42%) were 6 to 12 years of age, and 26 (26%) were 13 to 20 years of age. All presented with subjective fever or chills; 97% had tachycardia, 80% had gastrointestinal symptoms, 60% had rash, 56% had conjunctival injection, and 27% had mucosal changes. Elevated levels of C-reactive protein, d-dimer, and troponin were found in 100%, 91%, and 71% of the patients, respectively; 62% received vasopressor support, 53% had evidence of myocarditis, 80% were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 2 died.

Although the predominant clinical presentation is with respiratory disease, neurological manifestations are being recognised increasingly. On the basis of knowledge of other coronaviruses, especially those that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemics, cases of CNS and peripheral nervous system disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 might be expected to be rare. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: A growing number of case reports and series describe a wide array of neurological manifestations in 901 patients, but many have insufficient detail, reflecting the challenge of studying such patients. Encephalopathy has been reported for 93 patients in total, including 16 (7%) of 214 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and 40 (69%) of 58 patients in intensive care with COVID-19 in France. Encephalitis has been described in eight patients to date, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in 19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the CSF of some patients. Anosmia and ageusia are common, and can occur in the absence of other clinical features. Unexpectedly, acute cerebrovascular disease is also emerging as an important complication, with cohort studies reporting stroke in 2\u20136% of patients hospitalised with COVID-19. So far, 96 patients with stroke have been described, who frequently had vascular events in the context of a pro-inflammatory hypercoagulable state with elevated C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and ferritin. WHERE NEXT? Careful clinical, diagnostic, and epidemiological studies are needed to help define the manifestations and burden of neurological disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Precise case definitions must be used to distinguish non-specific complications of severe disease (eg, hypoxic encephalopathy and critical care neuropathy) from those caused directly or indirectly by the virus, including infectious, para-infectious, and post-infectious encephalitis, hypercoagulable states leading to stroke, and acute neuropathies such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Recognition of neurological disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 in patients whose respiratory infection is mild or asymptomatic might prove challenging, especially if the primary COVID-19 illness occurred weeks earlier. The proportion of infections leading to neurological disease will probably remain small. However, these patients might be left with severe neurological sequelae. With so many people infected, the overall number of neurological patients, and their associated health burden and social and economic costs might be large. Health-care planners and policy makers must prepare for this eventuality, while the many ongoing studies investigating neurological associations increase our knowledge base.","publish_time":1593648000000,"author_summary":" Ellul, Mark A; Benjamin, Laura; Singh,<br>Bhagteshwar; Lant, Suzannah; Michael, Benedict Daniel;<br>Easton, Ava; Kneen, Rachel; Defres, Sylviane; Sejvar,<br>Jim; Solomon, Tom","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by<br>severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2<br>(SARS-CoV-2), is of a scale not seen since the 1918 influenza<br>pandemic.

CASES: We present a series of four consecutive cases, seen by our psychiatry consultation service over a one-week period, each of which manifested delirium as a result of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). DISCUSSION: The four cases highlighted here all occurred in older patients with premorbid evidence of cognitive decline. Unique features seen in multiple cases included rigidity, alogia, abulia, and elevated inflammatory markers. In all four cases, a change in mental status was the presenting symptom, and three of the four cases lacked significant respiratory symptoms. In addition to discussing unique features of the cases, we discuss possible pathophysiologic explanations for COVID-19 delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Delirium should be recognized as a potential feature of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and may be the only presenting symptom. Based on the high rates of delirium demonstrated in prior studies, hospitals should consider adding mental status changes to the list of testing criteria.

Method: We conducted a review of the various case reports and retrospective clinical studies published on the neurological manifestations, associated literature, and related pathophysiology of COVID-19 using PUBMED and subsequent proceedings. A total of 118 articles were thoroughly reviewed in order to highlight the plausible spectrum of neurological manifestations of COVID 19. Every article was either based on descriptive analysis, clinical scenarios, correspondence, and editorials emphasizing the neurological manifestations either directly or indirectly. We then tried to highlight the significant plausible manifestations and complications that could be related to the pandemic. With little known about the dynamics and the presentation spectrum of the virus apart from the respiratory symptoms, this area needs further consideration. Conclusion: The neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 such as Encephalitis, Meningitis, acute cerebrovascular disease, and Guillain Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) are of great concern. But in the presence of life-threatening abnormal vitals in severely ill COVID-19 patients, these are not usually underscored. There is a need to diagnose these manifestations at the earliest to limit long term sequelae. Much research is needed to explore the role of SARS-CoV-2 in causing these neurological manifestations by isolating it either from cerebrospinal fluid or brain tissues of the deceased on autopsy. We also recommend exploring the risk factors that lead to the development of these neurological manifestations.","publish_time":1590105600000,"author_summary":" Ahmed, Muhammad Umer; Hanif, Muhammad; Ali,<br>Mukarram Jamat; Haider, Muhammad Adnan; Kherani,<br>Danish; Memon, Gul Muhammad; Karim, Amin H.; Sattar,<br>Abdul","abstract_summary":" Background: Coronavirus disease 2019<br>(COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome<br>coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been associated with many<br>neurological symptoms but there is a little evidence-based<br>published material on the neurological manifestations<br>of COVID-19.

Clinical manifestations are diverse and range from mild arthritis to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). DAH is a rare and devastating complication of SLE that carries a mortality rate of up to 50%, despite aggressive therapy. CASE REPORT: A 21-year-old primigravida at 16 weeks gestation presents with a productive cough, rash, sore throat, and high-grade fever. Chest x-ray suggested multifocal pneumonia. Patient deteriorated despite antibiotics and intravenous (IV) fluids. She developed worsening anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Autoimmune work-up was positive for Coombs, antinuclear antibody, anti-smith antibody, and hypocomplementemia. Skin biopsy was consistent with SLE. SLE vasculitis was suspected. She required mechanical intubation for rapid respiratory deterioration, with CT thorax suggesting ARDS. Bronchoscopy was done and confirmed DAH. Her course was further complicated with retinopathy and acute pancreatitis associated with SLE. She was treated with IV steroids, IV cyclophosphamide, and plasmapheresis, with significant clinical improvement and successful extubation. She delivered a healthy baby at 32 weeks gestation. CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to survival in DAH and requires a high index of clinical suspicion. Treatment includes high-dose steroids, cyclophosphamide, and plasma exchange. Pregnancy increases the risk of adverse outcome in SLE. Seven cases of DAH in pregnant patients with SLE have been reported. Here, we report a catastrophic presentation of DAH, acute pancreatitis, and retinopathy in a pregnant patient with newly diagnosed SLE.","publish_time":1586822400000,"author_summary":" Yousif, Patrick A.; Moshrefi, Hameadreza;<br>Meysami, Alireza; Alkhatib, Ayad H.","abstract_summary":" Patient: Female, 21-year-old Final<br>Diagnosis: Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage Symptoms: Cough \u2022<br>dyspnea \u2022 fever \u2022 rash \u2022 sore throat Medication: \u2014<br>Clinical Procedure: \u2014 Specialty: Rheumatology<br>OBJECTIVE: Rare disease Background: Systemic lupus<br>erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized<br>by autoantibody production leading to<br>inflammation in multiple organs; it commonly affects young<br>women in their child-bearing years.

Severe COVID-19 shares common risk factors with cerebrovascular diseases, and it is currently unclear whether the infection per se represents an independent stroke risk factor. Regardless of any direct or indirect neurological manifestations, the COVID-19 pandemic has a huge impact on the management of neurological patients, whether infected or not. In particular, the majority of stroke services worldwide have been negatively influenced in terms of care delivery and fear to access healthcare services. The effect on healthcare quality in the field of other neurological diseases is additionally evaluated.","publish_time":1591660800000,"author_summary":" Tsivgoulis, Georgios; Palaiodimou, Lina;<br>Katsanos, Aristeidis H.; Caso, Valeria; K\u00f6hrmann,<br>Martin; Molina, Carlos; Cordonnier, Charlotte;<br>Fischer, Urs; Kelly, Peter; Sharma, Vijay K.; Chan,<br>Amanda C.; Zand, Ramin; Sarraj, Amrou; Schellinger,<br>Peter D.; Voumvourakis, Konstantinos I.;<br>Grigoriadis, Nikolaos; Alexandrov, Andrei V.; Tsiodras,<br>Sotirios","abstract_summary":" The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome<br>coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China and<br>rapidly spread worldwide, with a vast majority of<br>confirmed cases presenting with respiratory symptoms.<br>Potential neurological manifestations and their<br>pathophysiological mechanisms have not been thoroughly<br>established.

SARS CoV-2 was confirmed on RT-PCR. Neurological examination was non-contributory. As his clinical condition improved, the patient reported that his initial symptom was an auditory hallucination telling him to jump from a bridge or ingest bleach. He reported that the increasing intensity of his auditory hallucinations led him to act upon it. He denied mood symptoms or suicidal ideation. The hallucinations did not recur during the hospital course, but he required 3 doses of antipsychotic medication for agitation.

METHODS: Eleven GBS cases in four key COVID-19 hotspots are discussed regarding presenting symptoms, response to therapies and cross-reactivity of COVID spike proteins with nerve glycolipids. Emerging cases of COVID-19\u2013triggered autoimmune necrotizing myositis (NAM) and encephalopathies are also reviewed in the context of viral invasion, autoimmunity and ongoing immunotherapies. RESULTS: Collective data indicate that in this pandemic any patient presenting with an acute paralytic disease-like GBS, encephalomyelitis or myositis-even without systemic symptoms, may represent the first manifestation of COVID-19. Anosmia, ageusia, other cranial neuropathies and lymphocytopenia are red flags enhancing early diagnostic suspicion. In Miller-Fisher Syndrome, ganglioside antibodies against GD1b, instead of QG1b, were found; because the COVID-19 spike protein also binds to sialic acid-containing glycoproteins for cell-entry and anti-GD1b antibodies typically cause ataxic neuropathy, cross-reactivity between COVID-19\u2013bearing gangliosides and peripheral nerve glycolipids was addressed. Elevated Creatine Kinase (>10,000) is reported in 10% of COVID-19\u2013infected patients; two such patients presented with painful muscle weakness responding to IVIg indicating that COVID-19\u2013triggered NAM is an overlooked entity. Cases of acute necrotizing brainstem encephalitis, cranial neuropathies with leptomeningeal enhancement, and tumefactive postgadolinium-enhanced demyelinating lesions are now emerging with the need to explore neuroinvasion and autoimmunity. Concerns for modifications-if any-of chronic immunotherapies with steroids, mycophenolate, azathioprine, IVIg, and anti-B-cell agents were addressed; the role of complement in innate immunity to viral responses and anti-complement therapeutics (i.e. eculizumab) were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Emerging data indicate that COVID-19 can trigger not only GBS but other autoimmune neurological diseases necessitating vigilance for early diagnosis and therapy initiation. Although COVID-19 infection, like most other viruses, can potentially worsen patients with pre-existing autoimmunity, there is no evidence that patients with autoimmune neurological diseases stable on common immunotherapies are facing increased risks of infection.","publish_time":1591660800000,"author_summary":" Dalakas, Marinos C.","abstract_summary":" OBJECTIVE: To present the<br>COVID-19\u2013associated GBS, the prototypic viral-triggered<br>autoimmune disease, in the context of other emerging<br>COVID-19\u2013triggered autoimmunities, and discuss potential<br>concerns with ongoing neuroimmunotherapies.

CASE SUMMARY A 74-year-old female patient complained of severe diarrhea. She did not have fever, coughing, or breathing difficulties. A physical examination revealed no obvious positive signs. The patient had been hypertensive for more than 10 years. Her blood pressure was well controlled. On January 9, 2020, the patient's son visited a colleague who was later confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 and his first close contact with our patient was on January 17. The patient was first diagnosed with gastrointestinal dysfunction. However, considering her indirect contact with a SARS-CoV-2-infected individual, we suggested that an atypical pneumonia virus infection should be ruled out. A computed tomography scan was performed on January 26, and showed ground-glass nodules scattered along the two lungs, suggestive of viral pneumonia. Given the clinical characteristics, epidemiological history, and examination, the patient was diagnosed with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). CONCLUSION Our patient had atypical symptoms of COVID-19. Careful acquisition of an epidemiological history is necessary to make a correct diagnosis and strategize a treatment plan.","publish_time":1586131200000,"author_summary":" Li, Rui-Lin; Chu, Shu-Guang; Luo, Yu; Huang,<br>Zhen-Hao; Hao, Ying; Fan, Cheng-Hui","abstract_summary":" BACKGROUND The first case of pneumonia<br>subsequently attributed to severe acute respiratory<br>syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan,<br>Hubei Province on December 8, 2019.

The patient presented with five days of fever, an erythematous maculopapular facial rash, and abdominal pain without respiratory symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive. Despite inpatient treatment for COVID-19 and a perianal abscess, the patient acutely decompensated, with worsening fever, tachycardia, fluid-refractory hypotension, elevation of liver enzymes, and transformation of the rash into purpura extending from the face to the trunk, upper and lower extremities, including the palmar and plantar surfaces of the hands and feet. Cytokine profile revealed rising levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1, higher than those described in either inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or severe COVID-19 alone. The patient was treated with infliximab for TNF-\u03b1 blockade to address both moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) temporally related to COVID-19. Within hours of infliximab treatment, fever, tachycardia and hypotension resolved. Cytokine profile improved with normalization of TNF-\u03b1, a decrease in IL-6, and IL-8 concentrations.

METHODOLOGY: A systematic review was conducted regarding clinical studies on cases that had neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 and other coronaviruses. The search was carried out in the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and LILACS with the following keywords: \u201ccoronavirus\u201d or \u201cSars-CoV-2\u201d or \u201cCOVID-19\u201d and \u201cneurologic manifestations\u201d or \u201cneurological symptoms\u201d or \u201cmeningitis\u201d or \u201cencephalitis\u201d or \u201cencephalopathy,\u201d following the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: Seven studies were included. Neurological alterations after CoV infection may vary from 17.3% to 36.4% and, in the pediatric age range, encephalitis may be as frequent as respiratory disorders, affecting 11% and 12% of patients, respectively. The Investigation included 409 patients diagnosed with CoV infection who presented neurological symptoms, with median age range varying from 3 to 62 years. The main neurological alterations were headache (69; 16.8%), dizziness (57, 13.9%), altered consciousness (46; 11.2%), vomiting (26; 6.3%), epileptic crises (7; 1.7%), neuralgia (5; 1.2%), and ataxia (3; 0.7%).

We aimed to assess the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases (from their inception until March 18, 2020), and medRxiv, bioRxiv, and PsyArXiv (between Jan 1, 2020, and April 10, 2020) were searched by two independent researchers for all English-language studies or preprints reporting data on the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection (SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, or SARS coronavirus 2). We excluded studies limited to neurological complications without specified neuropsychiatric presentations and those investigating the indirect effects of coronavirus infections on the mental health of people who are not infected, such as those mediated through physical distancing measures such as self-isolation or quarantine. Outcomes were psychiatric signs or symptoms; symptom severity; diagnoses based on ICD-10, DSM-IV, or the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (third edition) or psychometric scales; quality of life; and employment. Both the systematic review and the meta-analysis stratified outcomes across illness stages (acute vs post-illness) for SARS and MERS. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis, and the meta-analytical effect size was prevalence for relevant outcomes, I(2) statistics, and assessment of study quality. FINDINGS: 1963 studies and 87 preprints were identified by the systematic search, of which 65 peer-reviewed studies and seven preprints met inclusion criteria. The number of coronavirus cases of the included studies was 3559, ranging from 1 to 997, and the mean age of participants in studies ranged from 12\u00b72 years (SD 4\u00b71) to 68\u00b70 years (single case report). Studies were from China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Canada, Saudi Arabia, France, Japan, Singapore, the UK, and the USA. Follow-up time for the post-illness studies varied between 60 days and 12 years. The systematic review revealed that during the acute illness, common symptoms among patients admitted to hospital for SARS or MERS included confusion (36 [27\u00b79%; 95% CI 20\u00b75\u201336\u00b70] of 129 patients), depressed mood (42 [32\u00b76%; 24\u00b77\u201340\u00b79] of 129), anxiety (46 [35\u00b77%; 27\u00b76\u201344\u00b72] of 129), impaired memory (44 [34\u00b71%; 26\u00b72\u201342\u00b75] of 129), and insomnia (54 [41\u00b79%; 22\u00b75\u201350\u00b75] of 129). Steroid-induced mania and psychosis were reported in 13 (0\u00b77%) of 1744 patients with SARS in the acute stage in one study. In the post-illness stage, depressed mood (35 [10\u00b75%; 95% CI 7\u00b75\u201314\u00b71] of 332 patients), insomnia (34 [12\u00b71%; 8\u00b76\u201316\u00b73] of 280), anxiety (21 [12\u00b73%; 7\u00b77\u201317\u00b77] of 171), irritability (28 [12\u00b78%; 8\u00b77\u201317\u00b76] of 218), memory impairment (44 [18\u00b79%; 14\u00b71\u201324\u00b72] of 233), fatigue (61 [19\u00b73%; 15\u00b71\u201323\u00b79] of 316), and in one study traumatic memories (55 [30\u00b74%; 23\u00b79\u201337\u00b73] of 181) and sleep disorder (14 [100\u00b70%; 88\u00b70\u2013100\u00b70] of 14) were frequently reported. The meta-analysis indicated that in the post-illness stage the point prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 32\u00b72% (95% CI 23\u00b77\u201342\u00b70; 121 of 402 cases from four studies), that of depression was 14\u00b79% (12\u00b71\u201318\u00b72; 77 of 517 cases from five studies), and that of anxiety disorders was 14\u00b78% (11\u00b71\u201319\u00b74; 42 of 284 cases from three studies). 446 (76\u00b79%; 95% CI 68\u00b71\u201384\u00b76) of 580 patients from six studies had returned to work at a mean follow-up time of 35\u00b73 months (SD 40\u00b71). When data for patients with COVID-19 were examined (including preprint data), there was evidence for delirium (confusion in 26 [65%] of 40 intensive care unit patients and agitation in 40 [69%] of 58 intensive care unit patients in one study, and altered consciousness in 17 [21%] of 82 patients who subsequently died in another study). At discharge, 15 (33%) of 45 patients with COVID-19 who were assessed had a dysexecutive syndrome in one study. At the time of writing, there were two reports of hypoxic encephalopathy and one report of encephalitis. 68 (94%) of the 72 studies were of either low or medium quality. INTERPRETATION: If infection with SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar course to that with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, most patients should recover without experiencing mental illness. SARS-CoV-2 might cause delirium in a significant proportion of patients in the acute stage. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, and rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the longer term.

Historically, the group of human coronaviruses can also affect the central nervous system leading to neurological symptoms; however, the causative mechanisms of the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 disease are not well known. Seizures have not been directly reported as a part of COVID-19 outside of patients with previously known brain injury or epilepsy. We report two cases of acute symptomatic seizures, in non-epileptic patients, associated with severe COVID-19 disease. CASE PRESENTATIONS: Two advanced-age, non-epileptic, male patients presented to our northeast Ohio-based health system with concern for infection in Mid-March 2020. Both had a history of lung disease and during their hospitalization tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. They developed acute encephalopathy days into their hospitalization with clinical and electrographic seizures. Resolution of seizures was achieved with levetiracetam. DISCUSSION: Patients with COVID-19 disease are at an elevated risk for seizures, and the mechanism of these seizures is likely multifactorial. Clinical (motor) seizures may not be readily detected in this population due to the expansive utilization of sedatives and paralytics for respiratory optimization strategies. Many of these patients are also not electrographically monitored for seizures due to limited resources, multifactorial risk for acute encephalopathy, and the risk of cross-contamination. Previously, several neurological symptoms were seen in patients with more advanced COVID-19 disease, and these were thought to be secondary to multi-system organ failure and\/or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy-related brain injury. However, these patients may also have an advanced breakdown of the blood\u2013brain barrier precipitated by pro-inflammatory cytokine reactions. The neurotropic effect and neuroinvasiveness of SARS-Coronavirus-2 have not been directly established. CONCLUSIONS: Acute symptomatic seizures are possible in patients with COVID-19 disease. These seizures are likely multifactorial in origin, including cortical irritation due to blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown, precipitated by the cytokine reaction as a part of the viral infection.

Most responders (74.7%) consulted patients with COVID\u201019 mainly in emergency rooms and in COVID\u201019 units. The majority (67.0%) had evaluated fewer than 10 patients with neurological manifestations of COVID\u201019 (neuro COVID\u201019).

A rapid and pragmatic approach to understanding the prevalence, phenotypes, pathophysiology and prognostic implications of COVID-19 neurological syndromes is urgently needed. METHODS: The Global Consortium to Study Neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 (GCS-NeuroCOVID), endorsed by the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS), was rapidly established to address this need in a tiered approach. Tier-1 consists of focused, pragmatic, low-cost, observational common data element (CDE) collection, which can be launched immediately at many sites in the first phase of this pandemic and is designed for expedited ethical board review with waiver-of-consent. Tier 2 consists of prospective functional and cognitive outcomes assessments with more detailed clinical, laboratory and radiographic data collection that would require informed consent. Tier 3 overlays Tiers 1 and 2 with experimental molecular, electrophysiology, pathology and imaging studies with longitudinal outcomes assessment and would require centers with specific resources. A multicenter pediatrics core has developed and launched a parallel study focusing on patients ages <18 years. Study sites are eligible for participation if they provide clinical care to COVID-19 patients and are able to conduct patient-oriented research under approval of an internal or global ethics committee. Hospitalized pediatric and adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 and with acute neurological signs or symptoms are eligible to participate. The primary study outcome is the overall prevalence of neurological complications among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which will be calculated by pooled estimates of each neurological finding divided by the average census of COVID-19 positive patients over the study period. Secondary outcomes include: in-hospital, 30 and 90-day morality, discharge modified Rankin score, ventilator-free survival, ventilator days, discharge disposition, and hospital length of stay. RESULTS: In a one-month period (3\/27\/20\u20134\/27\/20) the GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium was able to recruit 71 adult study sites, representing 17 countries and 5 continents and 34 pediatrics study sites.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of articles in PubMed, SCOPUS and EMBASE data bases. Reviewed evidence is presented in sections of this manuscript which includes pathogenesis, neuro-invasion, encephalitis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9, ADEM, multiple sclerosis, polyneuropathy, and cerebrovascular disease. RESULTS: A total 67 studies were included in the final analysis of experimental studies, case reports, series of cases, cohort studies, and systematic reviews related to neurological manifestations of SARS- CoV-2 and other human coronavirus infections. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor is expressed in the nervous system. Common reported symptoms included hyposmia, headaches, weakness, altered consciousness. Encephalitis, demyelination, neuropathy, and stroke have been associated with COVID-19. Infection through the cribriform plate and olfactory bulb and dissemination through trans-synaptic transfer are some of the mechanisms proposed. Invasion of the medullary cardiorespiratory center by SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the refractory respiratory failure observed in critically-ill COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: An increasing number of reports of COVID-19 patients with neurological disorders add to emergent experimental models with neuro-invasion as a reasonable concern that SARS-CoV-2 is a new neuropathogen.

Larger studies have been limited by both geography and specialty. Comprehensive characterisation of clinical syndromes is crucial to allow rational selection and evaluation of potential therapies. The aim of this study was to investigate the breadth of complications of COVID-19 across the UK that affected the brain. METHODS: During the exponential phase of the pandemic, we developed an online network of secure rapid-response case report notification portals across the spectrum of major UK neuroscience bodies, comprising the Association of British Neurologists (ABN), the British Association of Stroke Physicians (BASP), and the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych), and representing neurology, stroke, psychiatry, and intensive care. Broad clinical syndromes associated with COVID-19 were classified as a cerebrovascular event (defined as an acute ischaemic, haemorrhagic, or thrombotic vascular event involving the brain parenchyma or subarachnoid space), altered mental status (defined as an acute alteration in personality, behaviour, cognition, or consciousness), peripheral neurology (defined as involving nerve roots, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junction, or muscle), or other (with free text boxes for those not meeting these syndromic presentations). Physicians were encouraged to report cases prospectively and we permitted recent cases to be notified retrospectively when assigned a confirmed date of admission or initial clinical assessment, allowing identification of cases that occurred before notification portals were available. Data collected were compared with the geographical, demographic, and temporal presentation of overall cases of COVID-19 as reported by UK Government public health bodies. FINDINGS: The ABN portal was launched on April 2, 2020, the BASP portal on April 3, 2020, and the RCPsych portal on April 21, 2020. Data lock for this report was on April 26, 2020. During this period, the platforms received notification of 153 unique cases that met the clinical case definitions by clinicians in the UK, with an exponential growth in reported cases that was similar to overall COVID-19 data from UK Government public health bodies. Median patient age was 71 years (range 23\u201394; IQR 58\u201379). Complete clinical datasets were available for 125 (82%) of 153 patients. 77 (62%) of 125 patients presented with a cerebrovascular event, of whom 57 (74%) had an ischaemic stroke, nine (12%) an intracerebral haemorrhage, and one (1%) CNS vasculitis. 39 (31%) of 125 patients presented with altered mental status, comprising nine (23%) patients with unspecified encephalopathy and seven (18%) patients with encephalitis. The remaining 23 (59%) patients with altered mental status fulfilled the clinical case definitions for psychiatric diagnoses as classified by the notifying psychiatrist or neuropsychiatrist, and 21 (92%) of these were new diagnoses. Ten (43%) of 23 patients with neuropsychiatric disorders had new-onset psychosis, six (26%) had a neurocognitive (dementia-like) syndrome, and four (17%) had an affective disorder. 18 (49%) of 37 patients with altered mental status were younger than 60 years and 19 (51%) were older than 60 years, whereas 13 (18%) of 74 patients with cerebrovascular events were younger than 60 years versus 61 (82%) patients older than 60 years. INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first nationwide, cross-specialty surveillance study of acute neurological and psychiatric complications of COVID-19. Altered mental status was the second most common presentation, comprising encephalopathy or encephalitis and primary psychiatric diagnoses, often occurring in younger patients. This study provides valuable and timely data that are urgently needed by clinicians, researchers, and funders to inform immediate steps in COVID-19 neuroscience research and health policy.

BACKGROUND: COVID\u201019 is an infection caused by the new coronavirus SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. The first reported case happened in Wuhan on December 1, 2019. At present, at least 1.8 million people are infected around the world and almost 110,000 people have died. Many studies have analyzed the clinical picture of COVID\u201019, but they are focused on respiratory symptoms and headache is generically treated. METHODS: I describe and discuss my headaches during my COVID\u201019 and I review the MEDLINE literature about headaches and COVID\u201019. RESULTS: More than 41,000 COVID\u201019 patients have been included in clinical studies and headache was present in 8%\u201012% of them. However, no headache characterization was made in these studies. As a headache expert and based on my own personal clinical case, headaches related to COVID\u201019 can be classified in the 2 phases of the disease. Acute headache attributed to systemic viral infection, primary cough headache, tension\u2010type headache and headache attributed to heterophoria can appear in the first phase (the influenza\u2010like phase); and headache attributed to hypoxia and a new headache, difficult to fit into the ICHD3, can appear if the second phase (the cytokine storm phase) occurs. CONCLUSIONS: Several headaches can appear during COVID\u201019 infection. All of them are headaches specified in the ICHD3, except 1 that occurs from the 7th day after the clinical onset. This headache is probably related to the cytokine storm that some patients suffer and it could be framed under the ICHD3 headache of Headache attributed to other non\u2010infectious inflammatory intracranial disease.

However, clinical research on its neurological manifestations is thus far limited. In this study, we aimed to systematically collect and investigate the clinical manifestations and evidence of neurological involvement in COVID-19. METHODS: Three medical (Medline, Embase, and Scopus) and two preprints (BioRxiv and MedRxiv) databases were systematically searched for all published articles on neurological involvement in COVID-19 since the outbreak. All included studies were systematically reviewed, and selected clinical data were collected for meta-analysis via random-effects. RESULTS: A total of 41 articles were eligible and included in this review, showing a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations in COVID-19. The meta-analysis for unspecific neurological symptoms revealed that the most common manifestations were fatigue (33.2% [23.1\u201343.3]), anorexia (30.0% [23.2\u201336.9]), dyspnea\/shortness of breath (26.9% [19.2\u201334.6]), and malaise (26.7% [13.3\u201340.1]). The common specific neurological symptoms included olfactory (35.7\u201385.6%) and gustatory (33.3\u201388.8%) disorders, especially in mild cases. Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome and acute inflammation of the brain, spinal cord, and meninges were repeatedly reported after COVID-19. Laboratory, electrophysiological, radiological, and pathological evidence supported neurologic involvement of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological manifestations are various and prevalent in COVID-19. Emerging clinical evidence suggests neurological involvement is an important aspect of the disease. The underlying mechanisms can include both direct invasion and maladaptive inflammatory responses. More studies should be conducted to explore the role of neurological manifestations in COVID-19 progression and to verify their underlying mechanisms.
