and (2) as deeply-rooted mental models are challenged during crises, any market-shaping initiative which promises a credible end to current instability with a new equilibrium will appeal to the natural human craving for stability.Our findings underscore the critical role that digital will play in creating business resilience in the post-COVID economy, and provide new managerial insight into how supply-side and demand-side factors shape business performance on a platform.To help firms navigate through the crisis and be better positioned after the pandemic, the authors present a four-stage crisis management model (calamity, quick & dirty, restart, and adapt), which provides insights and critical actions that should be taken to cope with the expected short and long-term implications of the crisis.", "title_summ": "Strategic Insights for NASDAQ 100 Firms using Twitter DataNavigating disruptive crises through service-led growth: The impact of COVID-19 on Italian manufacturing firmsViable supply chain model: integrating agility, resilience and sustainability perspectives\u2014lessons from and thinking beyond the COVID-19 pandemicStepping Up and Stepping Out of COVID-19: New Challenges for Environmental Sustainability Policies in the Global Airline IndustryImpact of Digital Surge during Covid-19 Pandemic: A Viewpoint on Research and PracticePandemics and Supply Chain Management Research: Toward a Theoretical ToolboxUse the crisis to shape your minimum viable system \u2013 And the wider marketMindful management of relationships during periods of crises: A model of trust, doubt and relational adjustmentsOperational resilience, disruption, and efficiency: Conceptual and empirical analysesIncreasing resilience by creating an adaptive salesforceEuropean SMEs amidst the COVID-19 crisis: assessing impact and policy responsesManaging the sales force through the unexpected exogenous COVID-19 crisisBouncing forward: a resilience approach to dealing with COVID-19 and future systemic shocksCoopetition and COVID-19: Collaborative business-to-business marketing strategies in a pandemic crisisFramework for Manufacturing in Post-Covid-19 World Order: An Indian PerspectiveSuper-Flexibility in Practice:Exploring the Disruptiveness of Cryptocurrencies: A Causal Layered Analysis-Based ApproachThe Crisis and Aftermath-II: Society and EconomicsConclusions: Still Risking Implementation GapsThe Italian value chain in the pandemic: the input\u2013output impact of Covid-19 lockdownCOVID-19 and Digital Resilience: Evidence from Uber EatsEcosystem-centric business continuity planning (eco-centric BCP): A post COVID19 new normalDon't adapt, shape!Insights from a CrisisBusiness models shifts: Impact of Covid-19Covid-19\u2019s Impact on Supply Chain Decisions:", "title_abstract_phrases": "Use the crisis to shape your minimum viable system \u2013 And the wider marketAbstract In addition to being resilient and adaptive, firms should also utilize shocks such as COVID-19 to generate new business opportunities.I also present some anecdotal evidences of attempts to alter business models in these circumstances in order to address the challenges that certain product characteristics impose but at the same capitalize on the business opportunities presented by the essentiality of the products.To help firms navigate through the crisis and be better positioned after the pandemic, the authors present a four-stage crisis management model (calamity, quick & dirty, restart, and adapt), which provides insights and critical actions that should be taken to cope with the expected short and long-term implications of the crisis.Strategic Insights for NASDAQ 100 Firms using Twitter DataThe coronavirus pandemic is having a clear impact on the supply chains of virtually all manufacturers, retailers, and wholesalers.Specifically, we consider how resource dependence theory, institutional theory, resource orchestration theory, structural inertia, game theory, real options theory, event systems theory, awareness\u2010motivation\u2010capability framework, prospect theory, and tournament theory offer ideas that can help scholars build knowledge about pandemics\u2019 effects on supply chains as well as help managers formulate responses."}
