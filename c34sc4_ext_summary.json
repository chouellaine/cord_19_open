{"cluster": 34, "subcluster": 4, "abstract_summ": "Conclusion Theoretical, experimental, and clinical evidence suggested that usage of face masks in a general population offered significant benefit in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses especially in the pandemic situation, but its utility is limited by inconsistent adherence to mask usage.CONCLUSIONS Although limited, current evidence suggests that viral carriage on the outer surface of surgical masks worn by HCW treating patients with clinical respiratory illness is low and there was not strong evidence to support the assumption that mask use may increase the risk of viral transmission.In the subgroups based on different study designs, protective effects of wearing mask were significant in cluster randomized trials, case-control studies and retrospective studies.A number of studies and reviews have been performed regarding the use of medical grade masks like surgical masks, N95 respirators etc.Meta-analyses suggest that mask use provided a significant protective effect (OR = 0.35 and 95% CI = 0.24-0.51).", "title_summ": "Part 1 - Face masks, eye protection and person distancing: systematic review and meta-analysisThe efficacy of masks for influenza-like illness in the community: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysisEfficacy of face mask in preventing respiratory virus transmission: A systematic review and meta-analysisEffectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza: A systematic review and meta\u2010analysisA RAPID SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE EFFICACY OF FACE MASKS AND RESPIRATORS AGAINST CORONAVIRUSES AND OTHER RESPIRATORY TRANSMISSIBLE VIRUSES FOR THE COMMUNITY, HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND SICK PATIENTSA Systematic Review and meta-analysisEfficacy of face mask in preventing respiratory virus transmission: a systematic review and meta-analysisFacemasks and similar barriers to prevent respiratory illness such as COVID-19: A rapid systematic reviewThe use of facemasks by the general population to prevent transmission of Covid 19 infection: A systematic review.A systematic review.[Rapid review of the use of community-wide surgical masks and acute respiratory infections].Facemasks for prevention of viral respiratory infections in community settings: A systematic review and meta-analysis.Utility of Cloth Masks in Preventing Respiratory Infections: A Systematic ReviewPhysical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.What proportion of healthcare worker masks carry virus?", "title_abstract_phrases": "In the subgroups based on different study designs, protective effects of wearing mask were significant in cluster randomized trials, case-control studies and retrospective studies.CONCLUSIONS Although limited, current evidence suggests that viral carriage on the outer surface of surgical masks worn by HCW treating patients with clinical respiratory illness is low and there was not strong evidence to support the assumption that mask use may increase the risk of viral transmission.In the subgroups based on different study designs, protective effects of wearing mask were significant in cluster randomized trials and observational studies.Efficacy of face mask in preventing respiratory virus transmission: a systematic review and meta-analysisBackground: Conflicting recommendations exist related to whether masks have a protective effect on the spread of respiratory viruses.Efficacy of face mask in preventing respiratory virus transmission: A systematic review and meta-analysisBACKGROUND: Conflicting recommendations exist related to whether masks have a protective effect on the spread of respiratory viruses."}
