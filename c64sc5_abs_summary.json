{"cluster": 64, "subcluster": 5, "abstract_summ": " The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is responsible for mediating viral attachment and fusion with cell membranes . Mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein occur at the most variable part of the genome . Mapping of the mutational landscape of the interaction site suggests a few of these residues are the hot-spot residues with a very high tendency to undergo positive selection ."}
