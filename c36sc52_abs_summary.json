{"cluster": 36, "subcluster": 52, "abstract_summ": " COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread across the globe . Predisposing factors such as age, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and lowered immune function increase the risk of disease severity . Cytokine and antigen overstimulation are potentially responsible for poor humoral response to the virus . Lower cellular redox status, which leads to pro-inflammatory states mediated by TNF-\u0251 is also potentially implicated ."}
