mortality in patients with COVID-19.BACKGROUND: Older age and elevated d-dimer are reported risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).The death prediction model is constructed by gender, age, basic diseases with coronary heart disease and hypertension, concurrent myocardial damage and thrombocytopenia, which has certain predictive value for the death of patients with severe or critical COVID-19.A pandemic named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbroke in China since December 2019.According to the risk factors, the death prediction model was constructed and ROC curve was analyzed, which showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of death prediction model for predicting the mortality of patients with severe and critical COVID-19 during hospitalization was 0.804, the sensitivity was 83.8%, and the specificity was 82.3%.CONCLUSIONS Various risk factors are associated with the death of severe or
