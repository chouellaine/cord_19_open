{"cluster": 64, "subcluster": 4, "abstract_summ": " Heparin prevents infection by a range of viruses when added exogenously, including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1 and inhibits cellular invasion by SARS-CoV-2 . The dependence of the host on the interaction of extracellular proteins with the cell surface glycosaminoglycan heparan sulphate (HS) is exploited by many microbial pathogens as a means of adherence and invasion . Findings may have implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing low molecular weight heparins ."}
