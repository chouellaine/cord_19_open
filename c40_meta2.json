Pleural effusion or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is rarely seen. In CT imaging, COVID-19 manifests differently in its various stages including the early stage, the progression (consolidation), and the absorption. In its early stage, it manifests as scattered flaky GGOs in various sizes, dominated by peripheral pulmonary zone\/subpleural distributions.

We generated a model showing that CT scan is endowed with a high negative predictive value (> 90%) and positive predictive value (69 - 84%), for the range of prevalence seen in countries with rampant dissemination.

The CT scan was assessed according to the CO-RADS classification.

METHODS: From 03\/01\/2020\u201303\/20\/2020, a retrospective review of all patients with suspected COVID-19 on imaging was performed. Imaging was interpreted by a board-certified, fellowship-trained radiologist. Patients were excluded if COVID-19 infection was suspected at the time of presentation, was the reason for imaging, or if any lower respiratory symptoms were present. RESULTS: Eight patients with suspected COVID-19 infection on imaging were encountered. Seven patients received testing due to suspicious imaging findings with subsequent lab-confirmed COVID-19. No patients endorsed prior exposure to COVID-19 or recent international travel. COVID-19 was suggested in six patients incidentally on abdominal CT and two on chest radiography. At the time of presentation, no patients were febrile, and seven endorsed gastrointestinal symptoms. Five COVID-19 patients eventually developed respiratory symptoms and required intubation. Two patients expired during the admission. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with imaging findings suspicious for COVID-19 warrant prompt reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing even in low clinical suspicion cases.

Cancer patients represent a vulnerable population in this pandemic, with data suggesting a higher risk for severe events and unfavorable outcomes. Timely identification of COVID-19 in cancer patients has been thwarted by the lack of outpatient testing for SARS-CoV-2. Chest computed tomography (CT) plays a major role in the identification of COVID-19 pneumonia, with radiologic hallmarks including bilateral, peripheral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation. Cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) commonly have daily cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) obtained for image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), and such imaging frequently includes the chest. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the CBCTs of an initially asymptomatic patient undergoing IGRT for breast cancer, who developed COVID-19 symptoms during the second week of RT. Lung windows of daily CBCTs were reviewed with Diagnostic Radiology to survey for changes consistent with COVID-19. Diagnostic CTs obtained at the time of recovery were obtained and compared with the CBCTs. RESULTS: Five consecutive CBCTs were retrospectively reviewed. Bilateral, peripheral GGOs were noted on the 4(th) and 5(th) CBCTs in the two days prior to symptom onset. CBCT on the day of RT resumption demonstrated substantial worsening of the GGO compared with those obtained during the asymptomatic phase. Diagnostic CTs demonstrated bilateral, peripheral GGOs and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, findings suggesting COVID-19 pneumonitis. Repeat diagnostic CT three days later showed improved pulmonary findings and the patient resumed RT without incident. CONCLUSION: Familiarity with typical CT changes of COVID-19 pneumonitis may allow for early detection in cancer patients undergoing CBCT for RT treatment. Prompt review of the lung windows is recommended in order to identify such changes, with the hope that pre-symptomatic diagnosis leads to expedited patient management, improved outcomes, and a reduction of inadvertent COVID-19 dissemination.","publish_time":1589846400000,"author_summary":" Youssef, Irini; Donahue, Bernadine; Flyer,<br>Mark; Thompson, Sharon; Huang, Alice; Gallant,<br>Fleure","abstract_summary":" INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 profoundly impacted<br>the United States, with New York City (NYC) rapidly<br>becoming the epicenter of the disease.

This article aimed to demonstrate the chest imaging findings of COVID-19 on different modalities: chest radiography, computed tomography, and ultrasonography. In addition, it intended to review recommendations on imaging assessment of COVID-19 and to discuss the use of a structured chest computed tomography report. Chest radiography, despite being a low-cost and easily available method, has low sensitivity for screening patients. It can be useful in monitoring hospitalized patients, especially for the evaluation of complications such as pneumothorax and pleural effusion. Chest computed tomography, despite being highly sensitive, has a low specificity, and hence cannot replace the reference diagnostic test (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). To facilitate the confection and reduce the variability of radiological reports, some standardizations with structured reports have been proposed. Among the available classifications, it is possible to divide the radiological findings into typical, indeterminate, atypical, and negative findings. The structured report can also contain an estimate of the extent of lung involvement (e.g., more or less than 50% of the lung parenchyma). Pulmonary ultrasonography can also be an auxiliary method, especially for monitoring hospitalized patients in intensive care units, where transfer to a tomography scanner is difficult.","publish_time":1592265600000,"author_summary":" de Farias, Lucas de P\u00e1dua Gomes; Fonseca,<br>Eduardo Kaiser Ururahy Nunes; Strabelli, Daniel<br>Giunchetti; Loureiro, Bruna Melo Coelho; Neves, Yuri Costa<br>Sarno; Rodrigues, Thiago Potrich; Chate, Rodrigo<br>Caruso; Nomura, Cesar Higa; Sawamura, M\u00e1rcio Valente<br>Yamada; Cerri, Giovanni Guido","abstract_summary":" The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by<br>the severe acute respiratory syndrome<br>coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan city and was<br>declared a pandemic in March 2020.

Furthermore, in cases of high clinical suspicion for COVID-19, a positive CXR may obviate the need for CT. Additionally, CXR utilization for early disease detection may also play a vital role in areas around the world with limited access to reliable real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID testing.

KEY FINDINGS: Medical Imaging plays an important auxiliary role in the diagnosis of Covid-19 patients, mainly those most seriously affected. Practice differs widely among different countries, mainly due to the variability of access to resources (viral testing and imaging equipment, specialised staff, protective equipment). It has been now well-documented that chest radiographs should be the first-line imaging tool and chest CT should only be reserved for critically ill patients, or when chest radiograph and clinical presentation may be inconclusive. CONCLUSION: As radiographers work on the frontline, they should be aware of the potential risks associated with Covid-19 and engage in optimal strategies to reduce these. Their role in vetting, conducting and often reporting the imaging examinations is vital as well as their contribution in patient safety and care. Medical Imaging should be limited to critically ill patients, and where it may have an impact on the patient management plan. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: At the time of publication, this review offers the most up-to-date recommendations for clinical practitioners in radiology departments, including radiographers. Radiography practice has to significantly adjust to these new requirements to support optimal and safe imaging practices for the diagnosis of Covid-19. The adoption of low dose CT, rigorous infection control protocols and optimal use of personal protective equipment may reduce the potential risks of radiation exposure and infection, respectively, within Radiology departments.","publish_time":1591228800000,"author_summary":" Stogiannos, N.; Fotopoulos, D.; Woznitza, N.;<br>Malamateniou, C.","abstract_summary":" OBJECTIVES: The aim is to review current<br>literature related to the diagnosis, management, and<br>follow-up of suspected and confirmed Covid-19 cases.

We reviewed patients who presented with symptoms of RP during the intensification of a regional COVID-19 epidemic to report on their clinical course and COVID-19 testing results. METHODS: The clinical course and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging findings of consecutive patients who presented with symptoms of RP in March 2020 were reviewed. The first regional COVID-19 case was diagnosed on 3\/1\/2020. All patients underwent COVID-19 qualitative RNA testing. RESULTS: Four patients with clinical suspicion for RP were assessed. Three out of four patients tested positive for COVID-19. All patients presented with symptoms of cough and dyspnea. Two patients had a fever, of whom only one tested positive for COVID-19. Two patients started on an empiric high-dose corticosteroid taper for presumed RP, but both had clinical deterioration, and ultimately tested positive for COVID-19 and required hospitalization. Chest CT findings in patients suspected of RP, but ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19 showed ground-glass opacities mostly pronounced outside the radiation field. CONCLUSIONS: As this pandemic continues, patients with symptoms of RP require diagnostic attention.
